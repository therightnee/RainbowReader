      <p>UX, as user experience is known, is <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/01/scaling_your_ux_strategy.html">the new black in business culture</a>. Most of the executives I meet with, regardless of their industry, now promote UX as key to their product strategy. That's a big change from only five years ago, when UX wasn't on anyone's radar outside the tech world. For a designer like myself, it's easy to recognize which executives know their products intimately, and which manage from a spreadsheet. Thankfully, I'm seeing the emergence of a new generation of UX-oriented leaders with little patience for the hands-off approach. They recognize that as UX eclipses traditional brand marketing, they need to be more hands-on with their products.</p>

<p><strong>The CEO as Lead Product Designer</strong></p>

<p>Steve Jobs famously ushered in an era of the CEO as "Lead Product Designer," <a href="http://inventor-labs.com/blog/2011/10/12/what-its-really-like-working-with-steve-jobs.html">as described by one of his close collaborators, Glenn Reid</a>, who worked with Jobs at NeXT and Apple: <em>"(Steve) told me once that part of the reason he wanted to be CEO was so that nobody could tell him that he wasn't allowed to participate in the nitty-gritty of product design. He was right there in the middle of it. All of it."</em></p>

<p>Given Apple's success, it is not surprising to see many executives following Jobs' lead. I recently met a top executive at a major enterprise technology firm who runs an $8 billion dollar product line and describes himself as the "Chief Product Designer" for his division (even though his title is SVP and General Manager, and he has never before considered himself a "designer"). A few years ago, this characterization would have seemed like a step down for a senior executive. The nitty-gritty of product design has become a badge of pride in many organizations, like Facebook, which has embraced a <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/03/inside_facebooks_internal_inno.html">"learn by making" executive culture</a>.</p>

<p>This product-centric mindset is not entirely new. The auto industry invented the blockbuster product "reveal" long before Jobs, with auto execs unveiling new "concept cars" at auto shows in an annual ritual of one-upmanship that continues today. For example, the now ubiquitous and much beloved Fiat 500 was first unveiled by Sergio Marchionne, no stranger to showmanship, at the Geneva Motorshow in 2004 following the buzz generated by the 2001 re-launch of the Mini-Cooper by BMW. This spirit is exemplified by executives like Akio Toyoda, the CEO of Toyota, who worked his way up the through the ranks from the assembly line. In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/business/worldbusiness/22toyotaside.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">2008 <em>New York Times</em> interview</a>, he said, <em>"If I am going to be at the top of the car company, I want to be the owner-chef &#8212; with knowledge not just of its vehicles but their ingredients. I taste my car, and if it tastes good, I provide it to the customer."</em>  As Toyota CEO, Mr. Toyoda has lived up to his word, <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Toyota_Crown_2013_Megaweb.jpg">launching the radically redesigned Toyota Crown last year</a> in a hot pink bubble gum hue that you could practically taste. </p>

<p>With consumer technology becoming such a status symbol in our culture, tech CEOs must put on a few good UX demos each year to reaffirm the connection to their products, or risk losing face with their peers and seeing their stock price plummet. This is a good first step, but it won't make corporate culture more sensitive to UX. For that, CEOs must move beyond showmanship.</p>

<p>Some CEOs do get UX. They use their products on a daily basis. I recently met a senior executive of a financial services company who is so obsessed with his corporation's product experience that he calls customer service with a new complaint each day, just to make sure the customer service representatives know their way around his product offering. </p>

<p><strong>"Customers" Have Become "Users"</strong></p>

<p>The opposite problem for some executives is that they can be too close to customers (for instance, IT managers who buy a solution) without understanding end-users (the people who actually use the solution on a daily basis) They get so much feedback from their sales teams that it leads to feature creep &#8212; adding features to satisfy every customer. Along the way, any semblance of a coherent user experience is lost. The result: a highly-reactive product development culture in which extra features are continuously bolted on, making the company vulnerable to more pro-active competitors who have a laser-like focus on UX, which can be a potent disruptor in many industries.</p>

<p>So, how do you know if your UX is actually working for your end-users?  Start by conducting a UX audit that captures the sequence of interactions your customers need to take to complete basic tasks with key products, be it renting a car or checking into a hotel room. Most executive flinch when presented with stark visual evidence of the convoluted nature of their user experience. </p>

<p>Here is an example of the sort of visual audit that usually turns heads with executives. This map provides a concrete picture of each step that is required to complete a simple task, in this case installing a home router for an IP telephony company (this map was created in 2005 and does not in any way represent the current state of their products and services). The map is divided into three key stages in the "Out of Box Experience": purchase and open, explore and setup, use and grow. We developed this map after observing a small set of novice users try to complete the process. We used quotes and anecdotes from these sessions to help make the case with executives for the need to overhaul the entire user experience around install, and not just redesign the physical router itself.

<p><strong>The Next Wave (Put on Your Hoodie!)</strong></p>

<p>The gap is growing between traditional sales-and-marketing-driven behemoths with their "customer-centric" approach and the new breed of organizations like Square and Zipcar, who have a "UX-centric" culture.  Tomorrow's leaders need to be able to close this gap. Fortunately, there is a great training ground for new UX leadership: the startup market. MBAs and other aspiring professionals are seizing the opportunity to create something new, emulating start-up heroes like Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey and Dennis Crowley. Not all of these startups will succeed, but leaders who join their ranks will learn valuable lessons seeing products and ideas rejected by end-users firsthand. These new UX-minded executives will take top jobs elsewhere, seeding a new UX culture in corporate America.  And they'll certainly be looking to join companies that "get" UX. </p>

<p>But what if you can't jump ship and join a start-up to learn UX skills? Many organizations are developing strategies to increase their UX capacity and promote product-centric entrepreneurship. Some large corporations, like Comcast, have launched venture investing arms. Others, like Google Ventures, are seeing these activities as more than just a way to make money, and rather as a way to engage the UX community. <a href="http://www.designstaff.org/">Design Staff</a>, Google Venture's fantastic blog, has become an online hub for sharing lean UX methodologies. Similarly, organizations like GE are investing in innovation accelerators that pair product teams with outside experts (like Eric Ries, author of Lean Startup) to coach teams in launching new initiatives with a more entrepreneurial mindset. (We can only hope that this UX mindset migrates to Crotonville, GE's vaunted leadership academy.)

      <p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=storytelling+in+business&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=8pO5Uex-r6rgA_HpgOAE&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=1682&bih=557"target="_blank">Discussions about story and storytelling</a> are pretty fashionable in marketing circles. I have ambivalent feelings about this. On the one hand, as a lifelong advocate for the power of story in business, I find this very encouraging. For all companies, having a story and knowing that story are crucial steps to achieving success. On the other hand, I'm worried that too many marketers think that telling their story through advertising is enough. It's not.</p>

<p>In fact, those that think this way do so at their own risk because there is a new kind of company on the rise that uses story in a more powerful way &#8212; and they run more efficient and profitable businesses as a result. </p>

<p>In my new book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/True-Story-Combine-Transform-Business/dp/1422170683/"target="_blank">True Story: How to Combine Story and Action to Transform Your Business</a></em>, I call these new companies story<em>doing</em> companies because they advance their narrative through action, not communication. Storydoing companies &#8212; Red Bull, TOMS shoes, Warby Parker, and Tory Burch, for example &#8212; emphasize the creation of compelling and useful experiences &#8212; new products, new services, and new tools that advance their narrative by lighting up the medium of people. What I mean by this is that when people encounter a storydoing company they often want to tell all their friends about it. Storydoing companies create fierce loyalty and evangelism in their customers. Their stories are told primarily via word of mouth, and are amplified by social media tools.  </p>

<p>So how do you know a storydoing company when you see one? These are the primary characteristics:  </p>

<ol>
	<li>They have a story</li>
	<li>The story is about a larger ambition to make the world or people's lives better</li>
	<li>The story is understood and cared about by senior leadership outside of marketing</li>
	<li>That story is being used to drive tangible action throughout the company: product development, HR policies, compensation, etc.</li>
	<li>These actions add back up to a cohesive whole</li>
	<li>Customers and partners are motivated to engage with the story and are actively using it to advance their own stories</li>
	</ol>

<p>Recently, my partners and I at <a href="http://www.cocollective.com/"target="_blank">co:collective</a> initiated a project to determine whether there is hard statistical evidence that storydoing companies are achieving superior results. We also wanted to create a <a href="http://storydoing.com/tool"target="_blank">tool</a> that allows CEOs and other senior leaders to apply these criteria to an analysis of their own company.  </p>

<p>One of the difficulties we encountered is many of the best examples of storydoing are privately-held companies, so the data on their financial performance is not publicly available.  </p>

<p>So we chose <a href="http://storydoing.com/methodology"target="_blank">42 publicly-traded companies</a>. This list spans seven business categories: retail, entertainment, food and beverage, electronic payments, consumer electronics, airlines, and IT services/products. Since storytelling companies outnumber storydoing companies, in each of the seven categories we chose five storytelling companies and one storydoing company based on the criteria we described above. The storydoing companies are Target, Walt Disney, Starbucks, American Express, Apple, Jet Blue, and IBM. More detail on the full methodology can be found here.</p>

<p>The early results we are seeing are quite compelling. As we expected, storydoing companies are generating a substantially greater number of mentions in social media:</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-1.gif"><img alt="Storydoing Chart 1" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-1-thumb-365x365-4467.gif" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
Those mentions are also more positive:</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-2.gif"><img alt="Storydoing Chart 2" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-2-thumb-365x268-4469.gif"  class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
This ability to light up the medium of people in a positive way allows storydoing companies to spend substantially less money on paid media per dollar of revenue: </p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-3.gif"><img alt="Storydoing Chart 3" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-3-thumb-365x365-4471.gif"  class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
And they wring more value out of that spend in the number of mentions in social media per dollar spent:</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-4.gif"><img alt="Storydoing Chart 4" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-4-thumb-207x329-4477.gif"  class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
As a result, storydoing companies are growing faster than their storytelling counterparts in revenue:</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-5.gif"><img alt="Storydoing 5" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-5-thumb-200x312-4473.gif" width="200" height="312" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
...and share price:</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-6.gif"><img alt="Storydoing Chart 6" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-6-thumb-200x399-4480.gif" width="200" height="399" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
One interesting side note is that it seems like the market hasn't recognized the structural advantage that storydoing companies have over their storytelling counterparts. Their superior results are not yet reflected in P/E ratios:</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-7.gif"><img alt="Storydoing Chart 7" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-7-thumb-200x410-4482.gif"  class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
This is only a start to our research, and we can only imagine that adding some of the privately owned companies for which we're missing financial data would yield even better results than those reported here. Whether that turns out to be true or not, time will tell. But based on the evidence we have to date, our conclusion is that storydoing companies are on to something very compelling. CEOs who seek to deliver better financial results to their shareholders would do well to take heed.  </p>

<p><br />
<em>In the spirit of collaboration and improvement <a href="http://storydoing.com/conversation"target="_blank">we would like to invite</a> anyone to help advance this thinking, by challenging our results to date, making suggestions to improve the methodology, or adding to the data set with data of their own. We think that over time the data set itself can become a valuable public source of inspiration and evidence for agents of change to begin to apply the principles of storydoing inside their own companies.</em>  <br />

      <p>Remember <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnCuwpnwscE">the scene</a> in the first <em>Austin Powers</em> film where Powers, attempting to escape in a steamroller, warns one of Dr. Evil's henchmen to move out of its path?  Despite its comically slow speed &#8212; and a huge distance between them, the guard stays rooted to the spot, yelling <em>Stop!</em> ... until it's too late. (The scene dissolves to his Donna Reed-like wife getting the news and noting tragically: "People never think how things affect the family of a henchman.")</p>

<p>On the industrial stage, something like that scene plays out all too often. A company finds itself in the path of an unstoppable industry disruption, can hardly fail to see it, yet simply fails to act. Only, it's not at all funny.</p>

<p>Consider the pharmaceutical industry, the focus of a <a href="http://fuld.sites.hubspot.com/boiling-the-frog-2013-white-paper-fuld-and-company?hsCtaTracking=6f2cd935-25b7-4173-b1d7-aa9f15d5377d%7C148574c3-32ce-47d6-80d6-255f7a6d74a9">recent global survey</a> my colleagues and I conducted. We asked nearly 200 life sciences executives about long-term trends that posed fundamental threats to their businesses and how management was dealing with them. Despite the fact that all were able to foresee developments unfolding over the coming decade with the power to irreparably damage their companies, 76 percent of the European respondents and 81 percent of the American ones said their companies had made no significant changes to strategy to counter those threats. (Executives representing Asia-Pacific life sciences companies were more sanguine, with 56 percent indicating their firms had prepared for an industry shock).  </p>

<p>In the face of knowable threats, is your own company making more than a futile effort to cry Stop? If you fear not, here are the suggestions we're sharing with the industry leaders we serve: </p>

<p><strong>Inject a steady flow of timely information and (sometimes harsh) outside perspectives into your strategic thinking. </strong>This means fresh information heard on the street, not just more searches on Google, and the use of outside experts to identify oncoming threats that they see and you don't. I've seen this work wonders for a number of companies that want neutral, unvarnished views of their competitive position.  A large pharmaceutical firm, for example, was about to make a big bet on a new class of drugs. But a panel of outside experts that had been assembled to critique the strategy warned management about an emerging risk. Citing early warning signals that were not being emphasized by the scores of industry newsletters and Wall Street analysts, it saved the company from the move that a competitor subsequently took &#8212; to its detriment.</p>

<p><strong>Develop scenarios of how the world might look five or ten years from now.  </strong>No one can predict the future, but by combining known trends in various ways it is possible to anticipate multiple possibilities &#8212; likely story lines about shapes the market could take &#8212; for good or ill. The few companies that have mastered this discipline have benefited mightily. A decade ago Oracle developed a series of scenarios that anticipated massive industry consolidation. Instead of waiting to be steamrolled, the company acted on this intelligence and went on a ten-year acquisition binge, acquiring over 90 companies from 2003 to the present at a pace surpassed only by Google. The result: Oracle became one of the most successful companies in back office database products and tools and has now moved onto advancing in the next market, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2013/07/11/cloud-computing-market-may-become-an-oligopoly-of-high-volume-vendors/">the cloud</a>.  <br />
 <br />
<strong>Experience threats through war games.</strong> There is no substitute for feeling and "touching" the disruption before it arrives. War games translate arguments and assumptions about the future into a tangible setting, allowing rival contestants to play out roles and experience risks. A successful war game can anticipate the moves of market players with an uncanny degree of accuracy. Multinationals have used war games to align strategy in global markets, where regulations and competitors differ. In a number of instances, I have seen war games acknowledge the threat from changing government regulation, informing the company that it must proactively work with authorities to help moderate new regulations, which in turn softened or averted the disruption altogether.</p>

<p><strong>Set trip wires for action. </strong> War games and scenarios should provide you with threads that you can track in order to determine which future world is emerging. You can spot these signals far enough in advance to change strategic direction &#8212; but you must regard them as imperatives to make timely decisions and to act on them.</p>

<p>Preparing for a future industry shock and anticipating its direction is all about honest, steady collection of intelligence and the readiness to alter your plans based on what you have learned. Plenty of executives lose sleep over approaching disruptions; a few vocally oppose them. Neither response will move you out of a steamroller's path. To survive, you'll need to watch, reexamine your position, make tough decisions, and take timely action.  <br />

      <p>On April 1 of this year, the Department of Defense <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/reuvencohen/2013/04/08/u-s-navy-issues-new-cloud-computing-policy/">announced</a> that the US Navy would embark on a strategy to migrate its services to the cloud.  While there have been numerous cases of big and small companies making this leap over the past few months, this one struck a particular chord with me because of its sheer scope.  The US Navy is an organization utilizing 1,400 systems and 7,000 applications to serve more than <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/nav_legacy.asp?id=146">500,000</a> employees.  My company, which is approximately .017%, .019% and .00028% the size of the USN in relative scope, made the transition years ago and it was no small effort taking almost 3 years to fully make the transition.</p>

<p>While the USN is relatively mum about its specific strategies, there are <a href="http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?id=4695">references</a> to the fact that they intend to cut their systems in half within 36 months, reducing some overhead cost and modernizing. This is similar to the <a href="http://fcw.com/articles/2013/03/18/amazon-cia-cloud.aspx">approach</a> that the CIA has undertaken in moving much of its infrastructure to Amazon Web Services.  These transitions, even when scaled down to a company of 140 like mine, require a substantial amount of planning, commitment, resources and time with little room for error.  So it comes as no surprise that whenever I spend time with industry peers who have yet to move to the cloud, there is a palpable sense of fear and overwhelming anxiety about how to even think about the process.  </p>

<p>When I'm asked to advise people on how they might craft strategies to get to the cloud, I give a four-point overview based on my own experience. It will get you to the starting line, but beyond that each and every strategy will be different depending on a myriad of circumstances in your corporation.</p>

<p><strong>Move only what you have to and start fresh wherever possible</strong><br />
The first thing is to dispatch with the idea that you are going to "move" all of your current resources into the cloud.  That is just not possible, especially if you have invested heavily in distributed enterprise class systems and the infrastructure to support them.  While it is certainly likely that a good portion of your environment can be virtualized and moved into a Platform as a Service (PaaS)/Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment like Amazon Web Services, the move to the cloud should be viewed as an opportunity to leave systems behind and replace them with systems that are lighter, faster and less expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Tear down and rebuild your security model</strong><br />
If your Microsoft SysAdmin has convinced you that Active Directory is a viable solution for the cloud, or that because you use Active Directory you can only get into the cloud by sticking with solutions that support Active Director (AD)/Windows Azure Active Directory (WAAD), you need to get a second opinion.  When moving to the cloud you have to consider that many solutions do not allow for authentication off of Active Directory and instead rely on more common security protocols such as SAML1, SAML2, OID and OAuth.  Identity Access Management (IAM) vendors have been forced to consider brokering authentication for Active Directory because companies feel like they must stay on it as an internal authentication platform.  Nothing could be further from the truth and if you do your research, you will discover that there is a wealth of options out there.  To get into the cloud you need the most robust and extensible authentication model you can possibly build and by doing so your <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V77F2mCMpX9oFyFHIgpoOD4hip0IZn88AYohMC0oqrU/edit">options for solutions</a> will increase exponentially.</p>

<p><strong>Cost savings are a benefit, not a driver</strong><br />
If you think that you need to get into the cloud to save money, you need to think again.  Yes, you will ultimately save money by migrating to the cloud, lots of money in fact, but it takes time to get there and there is the chance that you will actually spend more money upfront. When making your pitch to senior management, talk about the benefits of reduced infrastructure, resources, better uptime, business continuity enhancements, mobility and access ubiquity.  If asked about cost savings, be ready to deliver your pitch on how you intend to reduce or eliminate capex spending, reduce personnel resources, move services to a pay by month model eliminating long term contracts and ultimately reduce your annual budget by a modest percentage year over year over a 3-5 year period of time.  Do not get caught in the trap of making cost savings one of your drivers for going into the cloud.  You will bring a level of scrutiny over your claims, on which you will most likely be unable to deliver.</p>

<p><strong>Create a long-term flexible strategy</strong><br />
The last bit of wisdom is to develop the most thorough 1-, 3- and 5-year cloud strategy that you can put down.  My 1-year strategy is very specific; my 3-year is slightly less specific because I find that even 3 years down the road is very hard to see.  It's impossible to see five years in the future, but if you work backwards from 5 years you can, even at a very amorphous level, describe how you would want your environment to look at that point. These should be rolling strategies that are flexible enough to consider the dynamics of the industries you will operate in.  Today's Identity Access Management vendor will be tomorrow's Mobile Device Management (MDM) vendor and a week from now, could be bought by a company in some entirely different vertical.  By creating a flexible strategy, you can constantly adapt to these changing conditions in the industry over which you have almost no control.</p>

<p>In considering these four concepts, keep in mind that they are applicable to any size organization and any cloud scope transformation.  The more I have considered them, the more I have realized that they are applicable anywhere.  It's no small task, but you can move your company into the cloud if you approach things with a new mind and put aside the technologies of the past.</p>

<p>One last thing to note...in the next five years, new employees coming into your company won't know (or care) how to use Outlook or mapped drives.  They won't care for your PC laptop offering or why your firewall blocks Dropbox.  They will have established methods for doing work and they will all involve the cloud. Seventy-five out of the top 100 universities in the latest <em>US News and World Report</em> college rankings use Google Apps as their primary backbone.  Seven of the 8 Ivies are in the same boat.  Do you really want to be the last one at the starting line?</p>

      <p>I want to make one thing perfectly clear: this blog post is not an attack on the U.S., and my message is not anti-American. I have lived in the U.S. on and off for almost 12 years. I went to college in Boston (Berklee), my kids are both U.S. citizens as well as German citizens, and we have deep admiration for many American customs, traits, people and places.</p>

<p>But ever since 9/11, the U.S. government seems to have gone down a (until recently) secret path towards some kind of 'digital totalitarianism', with increasing disregard for other countries' mindsets and cultures. </p>

<p>The latest developments around PRISM and the NSA dragnet operations uncovered by Edward Snowden, in my view, severely damage the fragile fabric of the new global ecosystem, which we so sorely rely on in order to collectively tackle truly urgent global issues such as energy, pollution, food, climate change, (cyber-)terrorism and inequality.</p>

<p>Yes, of course, as more details about the NSA's mass surveillance activities are coming to light, it is also becoming clear that at least the other intelligence tribe members of UKUSA &#8212; i.e. the '5 Eyes' group (the U.S., the U.K., New Zealand, Australia, Canada) are pretty much doing the same thing, with Germany and France not far behind.  But still: at the heart of this global collusion to hoover up every bit of information about hundreds of millions of citizens under the pretense of fighting crime and terrorism sits the U.S. government, so let me start there.</p>

<p>The past few weeks have been game-changing for the U.S./Europe relationship, with the EU Commission already hinting at moving cloud computing centers to Europe, many parliamentarians proposing to review international trade agreements and data exchange practices, and German chancellor Merkel heading towards a pre-election show-down on these very issues. It is not actually the fact that surveillance is real that scares Europeans, it is that now, everyone apparently is a legitimate target &#8212; yes we scan, because we can!</p>

<p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/12/eu-to-usa-wtf-is-prism/">Little is being done</a> by the U.S. government to address Europe's concerns, and most Americans seem to consider this whole affair a non-issue. (Granted, this sentiment may be <a href="http://rt.com/usa/snowden-americans-majority-poll-906/">softening a bit</a>.) See the charts below:</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/snowdensupport-4461.html" onclick="window.open('http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/snowdensupport-4461.html','popup','width=365,height=318,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/snowdensupport-thumb-365x318-4461.gif" width="365" height="318" alt="snowdensupport.gif" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>But, it is a big deal.  And more people need to understand just how big.</p>

<p>For context, let's go back to 1788 and take a look at the words of James Madison, fourth president of the United States:</p>

<blockquote> "There are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations."</blockquote>

<p>The utter disrespect with which U.S. law enforcement agencies have violated the most basic international agreements on data security, basic citizens' rights and even diplomatic immunity is very worrisome, and will soon force people around the globe to rethink our relationship with 'all things USA' &#8212; whether it's President Obama and the U.S. government, or U.S.-based telecoms, technology companies and internet platforms such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Yahoo and even Dropbox.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, President Obama seems happy to preside over this Orwellian affair with a newfound disregard for the basic privacy rights of citizens, which he previously expressed with great vigor back in 2005 and 2007, when he was still just a senator (watch these <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/08/us/politics/08obama-surveillance-history-video.html?loadDynamically=false&commentsPosition=left&_r=1&">NYT videos</a>). This is incredible &#8212;  life is indeed stranger than fiction!</p>

<p>Let's be clear about this: for Europeans, in particular, the American shift towards state-sanctioned 'data totalitarianism' will have significant impact on whether we will do business with U.S.-based companies that are in technology, media, cloud computing, social networking, telecommunications, e-commerce or 'big data', for they seemingly cannot do anything else than comply with the laws &#8212; and their extreme interpretations &#8212; as they are now (i.e. the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act">Patriot Act</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Court">FISA courts</a>, etc). </p>

<p>Therefore, some 50-75% of the worlds' largest digital communications and technology enterprises are now facing a seriously wicked dilemma: do they comply with FISA orders or do they protect their users (half of which are not even U.S. citizens)?</p>

<p>The bottom line is that currently all non-U.S. citizens seem to have no real protection, no recourse, no oversight... no power, and no rights. This is totally and utterly unacceptable and cannot be swept under the rug as 'business as usual'. </p>

<p>Sure, variations of the same plots are happening in China and in Russia, but who would have thought that the formerly alleged bastion of liberty and freedom, the United States of America, would resort to these sorts of global dragnet activities?  This is wrong and that's all there is to it.</p>

<p>I believe that if this situation is not resolved very soon, non-U.S. internet users will be left with pretty much one option: some kind of a boycott or 'strike' &#8212; i.e. the explicit non-participation in those platforms and services that are subject to the totalitarian application of laws such as the U.S. Patriot Act. </p>

<p>The future of U.S.-based technology companies is at stake here, as is the future of U.S./EU relationships.</p>

<p>To remedy the situation, the leading U.S. internet and technology companies, led by Apple, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Facebook need to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Unequivocally side with their real stakeholders &#8212;  i.e. their users &#8212; and specifically assure us Europeans that they will act on our behalf, and seek to protect us against the abuse that has surfaced in the past few weeks.</li>
	<li>Mount a strong campaign to urge President Obama and the U.S. Congress to stop these global mass surveillance activities, immediately, and put appropriate approval, remedy and redress mechanisms in place that are more in line with EU provisions, i.e. requiring actual cause for data surveillance activities, needing individual warrants, and informing the public on what the procedure is.</li>
	<li>Urge the government to agree to a public trial of Edward Snowden that could take place in a neutral location such as at the International Court of Justice in the Hague.</li>
</ol>

<p>The U.S. government needs to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Acknowledge the mistakes and rights violations that have occurred as far as the mass surveillance of global citizens are concerned, and uncover all additional instances. Dismissing the Director of National Intelligence (James Clapper) seems like another plausible step towards resolution, as well, given the fact that he pretty much lied to Congress.</li>
	<li>Immediately discontinue the practice of spying on global citizens without individual warrants, and only in strict congruence with international laws and regulations.</li>
	<li>Agree to a fair, public and open trial of Edward Snowden (see above).</li>
</ol>

<p>If no action along these lines is taken, I think that the international community and hereto faithful users of American technologies and internet platforms will have no choice but to consider taking serious and possibly quite dramatic action to safeguard against this 'totalitarian surveillance creep'.</p>

<p>Some such actions for the international community may include:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Temporarily halting the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52010DC0385:EN:NOT">EU-US data exchange programs for travelers (PNR and TFTP)</a>, which could potentially lead to a significant disruption of commercial air traffic between the U.S. and Europe (the review was already scheduled before the Snowden affair and is already in progress at the Commission).</li>
	<li>Cut or significantly reduce ties with U.S.-based internet portals and service providers and shift business to providers based in other countries that are subject to international laws and explicit supervision (i.e. that can guarantee that appropriate processes and safeguards are in place). By extension, this would also concern the rest of the "5 Eyes" group, i.e. the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. </li>
	<li>Pause or even halt the current <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Free_Trade_Area">Trans-Atlantic Free Trade Agreement</a> discussions until these demands, above, are met. Yes, I know, this could be quite painful for some EU countries but ... would they rather be 'collateral damage' now or take collective action to address potential long-term issues?</li>
	<li>Open or expand cloud computing facilities in Europe (Luxembourg and Switzerland seem like good locations) and around the world. Until now, the U.S.-based providers have dominated the global cloud business because of faster innovation and much larger investments in this sector &#8212;  Europe needs to catch up urgently. </li>
	<li>As global consumers, we just may need to stop using all U.S.-based services that won't voluntarily comply with international standards of data protection.</li>
	<li>Offer a United Nations-supervised trial location and some kind of asylum to Edward Snowden, perhaps in the EU.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a game-changing moment, and it's time for global citizens to act. America: we love you, but enough is enough!</p>

      <p>For many, a corporate directorship is a career capstone. But attaining one is far from easy. No one can say for sure how to get on a corporate board, but many people point to two routes: the first is to break into the "right" network and the second is to seek a progression of board seats that begins with, for example, a seat on a not-for-profit or community board and eventually results in appointment to a corporate board. </p>

<p>Both paths are problematic &#8212; neither is particularly transparent or relies on objective measures and given that many boards are stubborn bastions of white masculinity, pursuing the "right" network can be fraught, especially for women and other diverse candidates. Indeed, <a href="http://hbr.org/2013/06/dysfunction-in-the-boardroom/ar/1">our research</a> reinforces that concern: many boards still rely on their own (mostly white, mostly male) networks to fill seats. </p>

<p>There's a different way &#8212; one that is more measurable, controllable and offers greater transparency. It starts with a focus on skills. Although many boards continue to select new members from their own networks, our research suggests that more are beginning to implement objective processes to select members based on the skills and attributes that boards need to be effective. Our 2012 survey, in partnership with WomenCorporateDirectors and Heidrick & Struggles, of more than 1,000 corporate directors across the globe, found that only 48% of the boards had a formal process of determining the combination of skills and attributes required for their board and, therefore, for new directors </p>

<p>We know this approach can work because we've seen it: We studied a large corporation that was being split into two public companies for which two new boards had to be created. The chairman wanted to create two balanced boards, with the mix of skills, knowledge, and experience each company needed. He appointed a special team to create an objective, transparent method for selecting the directors. After reviewing the roles and responsibilities of each board and the natures of the new businesses, the team derived lists of the skills each board needed. Then it created a model containing the dimensions critical to a high-performing board, from functional and industry expertise to behavioral attributes. This approach led both companies to recruit board members that were diverse in needed strategic skills. Both boards are on to a good start &#8212; demonstrating that when a firm builds a board using a rigorous assessment of the qualities it needs to carry out its governance task, rather than personal networks, the board is better equipped to execute its functions. </p>

<p>In our survey, we also asked about specific skills. We wanted to know which were the strongest skills represented on boards and which were missing. Directors named industry knowledge, strategy, and financial-audit expertise as their strongest skill sets.</p>

<p><br />
And 43% cited technology expertise, HR-talent management, international-global expertise, and succession planning as the skills missing most on their boards.<br />

<p><br />
We also looked at results by industry and region. The industry with the greatest skills gap was IT & telecommunications, whose boards are in serious need of international-global expertise and HR-talent management. </p>

<p><br />
The region with the greatest board-level skills gap is Asia, where risk management and M&A adeptness are sorely needed.</p>

<p><br />

<p><br />
Based on our research and experience with boards, we believe that the future of director selection is becoming increasingly objective and skill-focused process. Networks aren't going away, but aspiring directors may want to approach their search by asking not only, "what skills do I need to get on a board?," but also by looking at what skills boards already possess and what skills boards need. One strategy might be investing in your own human capital to become the board member corporations need.</p>

<p><small><strong>Methodology</strong><br />
<em>We surveyed more than 1,000 board members in 59 countries. (U.S. boards made up 37% of the sample while 62% of boards represented were from outside of the U.S.) We analyzed the data along several dimensions including geography and industry. Specifically, we did a geographical breakout by eight major world regions: Asia; Africa; Australia and New Zealand; Eastern Europe & Russia; Latin America; the Middle East; North America; and Western Europe (due to low sample size or domination by one or few countries in a region we have excluded three regions, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, from our findings).</p>

<p>The industry breakout was done using eight major sectors (similar to those in the Global Industry Classification Standard system): Consumer Discretionary (e.g., consumer durables & apparel, retailing, education, media, hotels, restaurants & leisure); Consumer Staples (e.g., food, beverage & tobacco, household and personal products); Energy & Utilities (e.g., oil, gas & consumable fuels, electric, gas and water utilities); Financials (e.g., banking & financial services, insurance, real estate); Health Care (e.g., pharmaceuticals, biotechnology & life sciences, health care equipment and services); Industrials (e.g., aerospace & defense, construction & engineering, industrial conglomerates, professional services, textiles); IT & Telecommunications (e.g., computers & peripherals, electronic equipment & components, semiconductors, wireless telecommunication services); and Materials (e.g., chemicals, metals & mining, paper & forest products). </p>

<p>The following multiple choice list of 14 skills was used in the survey: Compensation; Evaluation-Assessment; Financial-audit; HR-Talent management; Industry knowledge; International-Global; M&A; Operations; Regulatory, legal and compliance knowledge; Risk management; Sales & Marketing; Strategy; Succession Planning; and Technology. Participants were asked to choose one (or a write-in option of "other") for the strongest skill set or area of expertise that they brought to the board. They could choose as many as applied for skill sets or areas of expertise missing from the board (including a write-in option of "other"). </em></small></p>

      <p>In a war-game simulation, newly formed teams whose leaders encouraged collaborative decisions were at first quickly surpassed by groups with "directive" leaders. But the "empowered" teams learned more rapidly, and by the end of the simulation, they had bested the other teams by about <strong>20%</strong> of total points scored, says a research group led by Natalia M. Lorinkova of Wayne State University. Why do empowered teams get off to a slow start? At first, members go through a period of role identification, creating what may be inevitable early performance delays, the researchers suggest.</p>

      <p>Coupons. Gift cards. Loyalty points. These tried-and-true tools of the retail trade might not be as sexy as other forms of marketing. But together they account for more than $165 billion in purchasing power (<a href="http://news.executiveboard.com/2012-12-17-Gift-Card-Sales-To-Top-110-Billion-As-Card-Spillage-Declines-20-Percent">$110 billion in gift cards</a> purchased, <a href="http://www.colloquy.com/press_release_view.asp?xd=95">$48 billion in loyalty points</a> earned, and <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/167230/46-billion-dollars-saved-by-consumers-with-coupon.html#axzz2W0sH6QDn">more than $5 billion in product coupons</a> redeemed).  That's almost as much as <a href="http://marketingland.com/first-time-retail-e-commerce-spending-surpasses-50-billion-second-quarter-in-a-row-43071">total e-commerce sales</a>.<br />
   <br />
These instruments share a common objective: to influence purchase decisions by equipping consumers with incremental spending power for specific brands and retailers.  But consumers use them independently and individually (combining their value, when possible, takes a lot of manual effort), and store them in different places &#8212; often in drawers or folders where they lay forgotten and unused.<br />
 <br />
This is changing as coupons, gift cards, and loyalty points all become digital &#8212; and, more important, mobile. Mobile enables all of this purchasing power to converge in one place, and potentially be used interchangeably and collectively, always within easy reach for consumers.<br />
  <br />
What does this mean for retailers and brands?  The mistake would be to think that they can keep doing what they have always done, but just add a little digital to it. Instead, retailers need to think about coupons, gift cards, and loyalty points not only as three separate tools, but as different forms of Branded Currency.<br />
 <br />
Economists define currency as a store of value and a medium of exchange.  All of these instruments are stores of value, and by going digital and mobile, they become far more effective mediums of exchange.<br />
 <br />
The <strong>first wave</strong> of this convergence has made it easier for consumers to use their coupons or points for payment. Card-linked offers enable consumers to load coupons to their credit cards or loyalty accounts in advance of purchase. Valid offers are automatically applied as a credit when consumers' cards are scanned at the point of sale.  Consumers like it because they don't need to remember or present individual coupons.  Another approach is Shop-with-Points.  As an example, Amazon enables consumers to use their credit card loyalty points as a way to pay for purchases on the site.  Shoppers can see their balance and apply their points as easily as using a gift card or credit card.</p>

<p>Where the first wave made possible convertibility, the <strong>second wave</strong> introduces much greater convenience. Mobile wallets, like Apple's Passbook, bring coupons, gift cards, and loyalty cards together in one place without the constraints of a physical wallet. This innovation is good, but it's a bit of a horseless carriage, still tied to the mental model of a wallet.  Consumers still need to manually figure out which instruments can be combined and which cannot, prioritize them based on expirations, calculate the math on their own, and then present them at point-of-sale one at a time.<br />
  <br />
The <strong>third wave</strong> will be the mobile portfolio manager, the automobile to the mobile wallet's horseless carriage, which marries the convertibility of the first wave with the convenience of the second.  When you treat coupons, cards, and points as convertible instruments, fully leverage the power of digital and mobile technology, and add intelligence into the system, you get an entirely new possibility: calculating and comparing purchasing power, converting currencies, prioritizing usage, and dynamically creating scannable barcodes or other methods for combined payment. Soon consumers will be managing their Branded Currency the way they use Mint to manage their bank, credit, investment, and other financial accounts.</p>

<p>There is a lot of talk these days about <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/11/whos_your_brands_editor-in-chi.html">brands as publishers</a>.  But the successive waves of Branded Currency suggest that retailers will also need to think like bankers who mint their own currencies.  Market leaders will be those who best help consumers manage and spend Branded Currency from their portfolios, offer the best exchange rates, create the most liquidity, and make the most efficient markets.  Retailers who adopt and execute smart Branded Currency strategies will gain relative share of wallet and have deeper, more enduring relationships with consumers.</p>

<p>Starbucks is perhaps the most advanced retailer in the area of Branded Currency.  Most retailers treat their gift card program as an afterthought.  Starbucks, on the other hand, has turned it into a hub for competitive advantage.  In fact, CEO Howard Schultz considered the combination of mobile payments and social networking as central to the company's "blueprint for growth."<br />
  <br />
In 2011, Starbucks launched Android and iPhone apps that enabled customers to mobilize and easily reload their plastic cards or purchase new digital gift cards.  Most Starbucks customers use the gift card not as a present for others, but as an easy way to pay for purchases, redeem offers, and earn rewards.  In effect, they transformed their gift card into a mobile payment/loyalty card and their mobile app into a wallet for their Branded Currency.  Over 7 million people now use Starbucks' mobile app to make <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-ceo-presents-2013-sanford-183801144.html">4.5 million payments a week</a>, accounting for at least 10% of Starbucks total U.S. revenue.  Over 10 million Starbucks eGifts, the digital version of a gift card, have been sent just since 2012.<br />
 <br />
The strength of Starbucks strategy is not in any single program or promotion.  It is the way that the entire Branded Currency system works together to provide an integrated and seamless experience for the customer.  They knit together a variety of technologies and platforms from Apple, American Express, CashStar, Facebook, Square, and daily deal providers to promote and execute their deals, offers, and payments across digital, mobile, and social channels.  But most importantly, by having its own Branded Currency system, Starbucks maintains control over the customer experience, relationships, and data.<br />
  <br />
Many technology companies including Apple, Google, eBay and Square are hoping brands will rely on their platforms to integrate and manage coupons, offers, gift cards, payments, and rewards.<br />
  <br />
Apple has been quietly creating a platform for managing branded currency in the form of its Passbook app and a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/06/apple-files-imoney-patent-for-virtual-currency-digital-wallet-and-free-stuff/">newly filed patent</a>.  If brands aren't careful, they will be as beholden to Apple for digital and mobile coupons, payments, and loyalty as record companies are for digital music, book publishers are to Amazon for digital books, and social game publishers are to Facebook.<br />
 <br />
As the market for Branded Currency converges and grows, brands will fall into three categories.<br />
  <br />
<strong>(1)	Losers:</strong>  Some brands will continue to operate their coupons, deals, offers, gift cards and loyalty programs the way they always have, as separate standalone programs, and will adopt mobile technology reluctantly.  These brands will steadily lose their competitive edge and share of consumer spending.</p>

<p><strong>(2)	Laggards:</strong>  Some brands will play catch up, adopting best practices after they are widely accepted, and rely on the platforms developed by technology and financial services companies.  They will stay in the game, but will be in the middle of the pack, either unable to control the customer experience, lacking full access to their data, and losing margin to the platform provider. </p>

<p><strong>(3)	Leaders:</strong>  A few brands will set the pace by creating an integrated approach to using Branded Currency as a vehicle for customer engagement.  They will aggregate deals, offers, payments, and loyalty; unify online and offline; and put mobile at the center.  They will work with other third-party platforms and wallets, but not be beholden to them.   As a result, they will use their data to create value for their customers  and bring a unique brand experience to every touchpoint.  They will enjoy increased frequency and spend, forge stickier relationships, and greater and more sustainable profitability.</p>

<p>Will you be a loser, laggard, or leader?  History, current trends, and the billions of dollars at stake would suggest it's time to start building your Branded Currency strategy and system now.</p>

      <p>I feel genuinely badly for Barnes & Noble and its recently <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324507404578594152838322728.html">resigned CEO William Lynch</a>.  It has done by far the best job of anybody in the industry as traditionally constructed &#8212; and that is just not good enough. I don't think B&N can be accused of blindness. When it built out its vast network of stores, there really wasn't a meaningful threat from online sales or digital books. People bought books in bookstores, and B&N built the best chain of bookstores, bar none. <br />
 <br />
It is even hard to say that when Amazon came along, B&N should have followed suit immediately and committed to an on-line model. It is not at all clear to me that B&N had any of the skills, capabilities, talent, or experience to become a successful on-line bookseller.  Yes, it could have done an Amazon me-too, but as a legacy player, they would have never been given the ultra-cheap capital that Amazon has always had. And shareholders would have excoriated B&N for not making the earnings on its retail network that their high expectations dictated. <br />
 <br />
So I suspect that B&N was largely fated to be sideswiped by a fundamental paradigm shift in its industry and, while better than Borders, heading smartly in the same direction. <br />
 <br />
What would I do if I were running B&N today?  Good question.  I probably would take a close look at what Indigo, the B&N of Canada, is trying to do. It is attempting to become a lifestyle shopping destination in categories in which books play a consequential part but extending far past books. Categories like house and home, cooking, kids, babies, paper and self-help are tied to big book categories. Indigo can have a legitimate hope of creating a shopping experience across the category that integrates books-and-beyond in a compelling enough way to get enough traction with customers to fill up the store.  <br />
 <br />
It is probably a long shot and B&N probably has a lot more locations than this approach could support. But it is a way of utilizing the book heritage to provide a shopping experience that no one, including Amazon, would be able to match.  <br />
 <br />
And if I were to do it, I would use the approach that Harrod's employs. Most people do not realize that while Harrod's looks like a store, it is actually a mini-mall with each merchandise area leased out to an independent seller &#8212; an extension of the model that department stores use with their cosmetics/skin care floor.  <br />
 <br />
I would turn each B&N into a mini-mall in which each individual category is run by a lessee who is expert in that particular category.  B&N would act as the systems integrator, putting together a multi-category offering that attracts sufficient customers into the mini-mall.  It would also use its book-buying experience and power to stock each lessee with the book inventory required for their category assortment. <br />
 <br />
Would I bet my own money on this approach?  I probably would not. But it may be superior to the other legitimate alternative, which is to liquidate B&N now and return to capital-holders whatever net proceeds can be accumulated (if any can).  But wait.  There is always private equity.  Maybe they should call <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/william-ackman/">Bill Ackman</a> and see whether he wants to give the category another go.</p>

      <p>New data on employee engagement is in, and it's downright discouraging. As <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/hbr/hbreditors/2013/06/ten_charts_that_show_weve_all_got_a_case_of_the_mondays.html">this post</a> by HBR's Gretchen Gavett noted, Gallup's research shows that engagement among US workers is holding steady at a scant 30%. This means seven out of ten people are either "checked out", or actively hostile toward their employers. <em>Seven</em> out of <em>ten</em>.</p>

<p>Study after study shows that employee engagement, an index of bringing one's best and full self to work, is not just an organizational nicety. It is a business imperative, linked to a number of performance outcomes, including profitability, customer satisfaction and turnover. A <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/organization/pdfs/state_of_human_capital_2012.ashx">2012 report on human capital</a> from McKinsey added to the evidence, noting that organizations with top scores in employee motivation are about 60% more likely to be in the top quartile for overall business health. Companies I work with in my consulting practice who have done their own internal research have found similar linkages. </p>

<p>Of course, engagement is an emotional and deeply personal experience; it's not simple or straightforward to address. But leaders must do so, for the sake of not only their employees but also their companies. Here are pointers to help you to make real inroads in this area:</p>

<p><strong>Understand the basics of positive psychology and engagement research. </strong> At the end of her post, Gavett refers to <a href="http://hbr.org/2003/01/one-more-time-how-do-you-motivate-employees/">an HBR classic</a> on employee motivation, in which the famed management psychologist Frederick Herzberg argued that workers respond positively to more responsibility and authority in their daily tasks. This finding is resonant with <a href="http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/">self-determination theory</a>, a well-established research program in psychology that has identified the universal human need for autonomy. In other words, people generally do well when they are empowered to make choices and decisions for themselves. Plenty <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&UID=2011-03454-004">more research</a> has been done on work engagement, showing that factors such as social support and feedback can drive positive experience. Managers and HR professionals need to understand these and other robust psychological theories to more effectively shape their engagement efforts.  A wealth of information is out there, ready to be put to good use.</p>

<p><strong>Find out what engages your employees, not someone else's.</strong>  While broad research is a valuable resource, it can only take an organization so far.  No theory or model is useful in the abstract. What matters is <em>your </em>business and <em>your</em> people. Ironically, most organizations use engagement results punitively; they focus on what is going wrong, and on why people aren't as engaged as they could be. A better approach is to figure out what's already working in your business, and find ways to replicate it. Go to the most engaged individuals, teams and business units, and help others model what they do. I've used this approach to help businesses identify a unique "engagement signature" suited to their culture and context.</p>

<p><strong>Encourage grassroots engagement. </strong> Engagement cannot be mandated, but it can be ignited. Once you understand what matters to your employees, you can support its expression and replication far and wide. Empower your people, particularly the most engaged employees, to share stories, exchange ideas and disseminate best practices across the business. A well-designed piece of media, such as a video "starring" members of a thriving business unit, can gain traction and become a source of encouragement for others. With the rise of social media and digital workplace technologies, it's easier than ever to connect employees and make engagement contagious. </p>

<p><strong>Recognize engagement as a moving target, and check back often.</strong>  While certain elements of employee engagement will surely hold over time, it's not something that can be assessed and addressed just once. Research shows that <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&UID=2010-06187-003">engagement fluctuates daily</a>, and with changing circumstances.  What engages people during a surge in business may be very different from what helps them bring their best selves to work in a recession. To keep your organization engaged, you must remain engaged, curious, and connected yourself.<br />
     <br />
The next time Gallup or McKinsey do their polls, I'd like to see those engagement scores rise. What would it take to engage half, three quarters or 100% of the workforce?  Imagine what it would mean to business success, employee happiness and productivity. <br />
 <br />
What are you doing about employee engagement, and what can you share with others?  Let's begin the conversation today.</p>

      <p>Imagine crafting a sustainable career for yourself. Year after year, you perform work that makes full use of your skills and challenges you to develop new ones. Your work not only interests you, it gives you a sense of meaning. You enjoy opportunities for learning and development. You work with people who energize you. You are confident that your skills and competencies make you valuable and marketable and that you can access opportunities through your network. You are able to fit your work together with the other things in your life that are important to you, like family, friends, and leisure. </p>

<p>This is a rosy picture, to be sure; some would even call it unattainable. For a taste of what is usually associated with the word career, check out the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=career">Urban Dictionary's definition</a>, which characterizes a career as "an affliction whose symptoms are loss of life & liberty, general purpose misery, and resentment towards those who are unaffected" and "a euphemism for 'professional labor camp.'" </p>

<p>The entry is facetious, yet it does point to an undeniable truth: many employees spend the better part of their waking hours engaged in work that gives them nothing more than pay. "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation," wrote Henry David Thoreau in <em>Walden </em>in 1854. Today, over two-thirds of employees are disengaged at work, according to a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/strategicconsulting/163007/state-american-workplace.aspx">recent Gallup survey</a> of 150,000 workers. Economic stagnation and unequal access to opportunity keep a sustainable career out of reach of many. Even among the socioeconomically privileged, investment in education, hard work, and commitment to a company is no guarantee of career success and fulfillment. </p>

<p>However, there are steps you can take to maximize your chances of enjoying sustainable career success over the long term. Consider the example of Dan, who worked as sales engineer in the late 1990s for a company that developed voice recognition technology &#8212; a perfect fit for his background in and passion for linguistics and computer science. A few years later, the firm merged with its chief competitor. While Dan's job title remained unchanged, his responsibilities shifted in an unfavorable direction. Instead of the more creative work of synthesizing customer needs into technical solutions, at which he excelled, he was tasked primarily with developing proposals and statements of work. Not only did this work fail to capitalize on his strengths, it frustrated him and required skills he lacked. Thus, Dan found himself in a common catch-22: wanting to move into a position that would better fit his skills profile and enable him to recapture his outstanding job performance; he faced diminished prospects of mobility within the firm because he was underperforming at his new responsibilities. Furthermore, given the recent merger, this low point occurred at a time when he needed to demonstrate his value to managers from the acquiring company who weren't familiar with his track record. </p>

<p>To craft his career, Dan explored options for performing interesting work that exploited his talents and offered room for career growth while also increasing the value he provided to his company. He scoured the internet for information about other firms in the industry and found that many competitors employed solution architects, a position that didn't exist in his company at the time. Having gained broad experience with the development and deployment of voice recognition solutions in various contexts over the years with his employer, he realized that the solution architect role would both suit his existing skill profile and work preferences while also increasing his impact in the firm and opening up paths for increased learning. In addition, his research suggested that the role would support the company's strategic objective to take a dominant market position in the rapidly-growing market for voice recognition technology in mobile devices. </p>

<p>Using his respected industry knowledge, market insight, and professional network, he developed a proposal to create a solution architect. He explained how the new position could also enhance retention of high-value employees by providing an alternate career path for other sales engineers who were seeking opportunities for growth within the company. He used evidence from performance appraisals and multi-source feedback to demonstrate that his qualifications matched the position's requirements. </p>

<p>Management accepted his proposal and appointed him to the newly created position, an opportunity that kept him learning, engaged, and performing at his peak, which in turn ultimately led to a promotion a few years later. As expected, the role proved valuable for the company, which in turn hired additional solution architects from outside and promoted other employees into the position.</p>

<p>If you'd like to craft your own career, try out these strategies, which I recommend in my career management courses and workshops:<br />
<ul><br />
	<li>Embrace the fact that you are the pilot of your career. No one else has direct access to your ambitions, interests, and values, and no one is going to take you by the hand and help you create a fulfilling career. The more you practice career crafting, the better you get at it.</li><br />
	<li>Develop a discipline of identifying and documenting the ways in which you add value to your employer. Spend a few minutes at the end of each week to record what you've learned and accomplished as well as to record feedback received. Just 5-10 minutes of systematic effort weekly will soon yield a rich archive of material that you can use to deepen your self-awareness, hone your career goals, and document your value.</li><br />
	<li>Link your accomplishments to your career goals. Discuss your goals with your manager periodically, even if this process is not formalized. Maintain positive, productive relationships with people who can help you to access opportunities.</li><br />
	<li>Pay close attention to developments in your industry and to the strategic direction of your firm. Understand your firm's core competencies &#8212; the parts of its operation that drive its competitiveness in the marketplace &#8212; and make sure that you play a contributing role. Look for ways to get involved in growth areas. </li><br />
	<li>Seek opportunities to work with people who energize you. Many of my executive students recount that their biggest career boosts have come from working alongside smart, energetic, connected people who have taken an interest in them. These productive opportunities are much more likely to occur when you actively seek them out.</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>A sustainable career is dynamic and flexible; it features continuous learning, periodic renewal, the security that comes from employability, and a harmonious fit with your skills, interests, and values. The keys to crafting a sustainable career are knowing yourself &#8212; what interests you, what you do best and not so well, what energizes you &#8212; and being acutely attuned to the fields and companies you're interested in, so that you can identify places where you can add value. The "follow your passion" self-help industry tends to under-emphasize this key point: all of the self-awareness in the world is of little use if you can't pitch your passion to a buyer. A sustainable career is built upon the ability to show that you can fill a need that someone is willing to pay for. This holds not only when you're starting a business or looking for a new job; it's also an important springboard for refining your current job and your career trajectory to make it more ideal.<br />

      <p>The fastest-growing segments of America's job market &#8212; by far &#8212; are temporary and part-time employment.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of US part-time employees <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/9/new-us-economy-part-time-and-temp-job-markets-expl/">hit a record high</a> of 28 million. Temporary employment has <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/07/temporary-jobs-becoming-permanent-fixture/2496585/">jumped 50%</a> since the depths of the financial crisis. This "ephemeral workforce" phenomenon isn't just American; <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/16/record-number-of-part-time-workers-in-uk-as-unemployment-falls-by-50000-601858/">the UK has also set records</a> in the contingently employed. Something profoundly structural is going on. Even healthier economic growth won't make it go away. </p>

<p>More companies want far greater flexibility with far fewer people. Their greatest human capital concerns have shifted. They seem increasingly focused on productively <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/schrage/2012/10/the-coming-collapse-of-average.html">cultivating that core 20% to 25% of people who reliably generate the 70% to 80% of enterprise value</a>. They're rethinking their economic relationships with the rest.</p>

<p>Workflows and innovation initiatives have been artfully reorganized around "projects" to facilitate faster, cheaper and easier contingent participation. Technology makes reviewing, refining, redesigning and revising both jobs and job descriptions as dynamic as a commodities trading desk.</p>

<p>Have people been commoditized?  Of course not.  But the ways people's knowledge, skills and expertise get plugged into the workplace has been. For roughly half of America's workforce, the role, rules and requirements of "the job" are dramatically different than they were even a decade ago. Just ask anyone working in the health care, financial services, automobile, retail, media, publishing, education, advertising, real estate or defense industries. </p>

<p>It's not that troubled economies and disruptive innovations inherently <a href="http://www.aei.org/article/economics/the-astonishing-collapse-of-work-in-america">shed more jobs </a>than they create; it's that ongoing global restructuring of markets makes <a href="http://www.realclearmarkets.com/video/2013/07/08/temporary_jobs_the_new_normal.html">temporary and/or part-time employment more attractive for more organizations</a>. Outside of the enterprise core group, bringing full-time employees onboard is increasingly seen as a riskier and less rewarding business bet.</p>

<p>And higher education isn't offering the human capital cure.  A recent <a href="http://mckinseyonsociety.com/downloads/reports/Education/UXC001%20Voice%20of%20the%20Graduate%20v6.pdf">McKinsey & Co. study</a> suggests that almost <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/12/college-degree-study_n_3263055.html">half of recent college graduates are working in jobs that don't really require a degree</a>. Do we really believe MBA or law degree credentials would better procure their full-time employment?</p>

<p>As <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/schrage/2010/07/hireless-recovery.html">this blog</a> observed literally three years ago: "Most people looking for a job today aren't competing against each other. They're competing against alternative ways to getting that job done. For most organizations, people are a means and medium to an end. They're not hiring employees, they're hiring value creation. If they can get that value &#8212; or most of it &#8212; from contingency workers, outsourcing, automation, innovative processes or capital investment, why wouldn't they? If [technically] tweaking a process or program empowers three people to do the work of five, then tweakonomics is the way to go. The profound difference between today [2010] and 2005 is that good hires looked like better investments than great tweaks back then. In 2010, good tweaks look like better bets than even great hires."</p>

<p>The "New Permanent Temporary" has arguably been the biggest employment change since I wrote that post. Like Smartphones, part-timerism's global growth proliferates. In fact, temps with Androids and iPhones already use services like <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-24/gigwalk-does-temp-worker-hiring-without-job-interviews">Gigwalk</a> and LinkedIn to more profitably find and manage their part-time and/or temporary work. Amazon has its below-the-radar "<a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/">Mechanical Turk</a>" workplace market. For the gainfully underemployed, everyday is BYOD; their technologies are becoming their toolkits. Technology doesn't just facilitate automation and innovation; it makes contingent, temporary and part-time job markets more efficient and effective.</p>

<p>The economic irony for both sides of the enterprise equation is that maximizing the value of part-time employment has become a full-time job. Employers from WalMart to PepsiCo to Adecco to Microsoft pay premiums to assure their armies of independent contractors and temps cost-effectively get the job(s) done. Conversely, serious part-timers quickly learn that productively juggling several temporary positions requires more skill than luck. </p>

<p>Holding the uncertainties around Obamacare, government regulation, automation and/or economic growth responsible for full-time employment aversion misses the larger point. The rise of part time jobs means the absence of full-time commitment. Growing number of employers are increasingly committed to not being committed.  </p>

<p>It's analogous to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/04/living/women-premarital-cohabitation">the demographic rise in cohabitation</a> before marriage: the nature and expectations around formal commitment are being redefined. Just as cohabitation doesn't necessarily lead to marriage, temporary and contingent employment doesn't necessarily lead to full-time jobs.</p>

<p>The most serious question going forward is not simply whether or how more full time jobs return, it's whether or how part-time and temporary workers become more valuable. <strong>Will employers invest in developing the knowledge, human capital and capabilities of their contingent workforces and independent contractors? </strong>Or is the new "permanent temporary" merely about a fair day's work for a fair day's pay? </p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/33851/free-agent-nation">Daniel Pink's <em>Free Agent Nation </em></a>and <a href="http://hbr.org/1998/09/the-dawn-of-the-e-lance-economy/ar/1">Tom Malone's <em>E-Lance Economy</em> </a>argued well over a decade ago, the innovatively self-employed can earn handsome livings if they're willing to adapt, invest in themselves and learn. <strong>But who invests in the not-as-innovative and not-quite-as-adaptable part-time worker? </strong>Who is their <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Salman Khan</a>? What are their media and mechanisms for becoming more valuable?</p>

<p>As the brilliant economist, Treasury Secretary and former Harvard University President Larry Summers <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/06/neoliberalism">once observed</a>, "In the history of the world, no one has ever washed a rented car." If this implies that no employers will invest in the upgrade of their "rented" temps and part-timers, that bodes very poorly for this rising class of worker.</p>

<p>My bet? Underemployed assets are frequently undervalued assets. Undervalued assets attract savvy investors and entrepreneurs.  Prepare for the <em>next </em>New Permanent Temporary.</p>

      <p>Enterprise IT is in crisis &#8212; no doubt about it. Our research, conducted in partnership with Harvard Business Review, The Economist, CEB (formerly the Corporate Executive Board), Intel, and TNS Global, finds that corporate leadership has lost confidence in the CIO as a strategic partner and views IT as a commodity rather than a difference-maker.  </p>

<p>Clearly the roles of CIO and the IT organization need reinvention &#8212; and that's the <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/04/corporate_it_and_the_conversat.html">conversation </a>we've been having over the last few months in webinars and posts. (See also <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/04/how_cios_can_keep_in_step_with.html">here</a>, <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/05/the_metamorphosis_of_the_cio.html">here</a>,  and <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/05/three_ways_cios_can_connect_with_the_c-suite.html">here</a>.) This conversation has generated a lot of interesting conversation via blog comments, emails, and face-to-face interactions at conferences and meetings and has revealed a few more insights that should factor into our evolving thinking. </p>

<p><strong>CIOs need to understand business better, but the C-suite should understand technology's potential better. </strong>While the CIO needs to understand the business to add value, equally true is that senior leadership and the board of directors don't understand how to incorporate technology in their strategy, and some don't even see the need to do so. As gerajohm commented, "The best executives I have met have had a great understanding of how to use technology to gain competitive advantage and improve operations. They also worked with the CIO to help them to understand the business. They worked together to identify the technologies that could improve the company's competitive advantage versus technologies that were needed to support the business. Once this was done, the executive leadership and CIO focused on implementing technologies that improve the company's competitive advantage."<br />
<strong><br />
Every other function of the organization is as out of touch as IT.</strong> <a href="http://www.victoriomilian.com/">Victorio M.</a> commented, "Reading this post is both humorous and disheartening. Humorous because, as a Human Resources practitioner, I hear similar calls for change within my profession. So it's not just us! Yet it's disheartening because it's yet another organizational function that appears to not be able to keep up with the pace of business, staying stuck in a transactional, as opposed to strategic, frame of mind." The Management Innovation Exchange is currently running a <a href="http://www.mixhackathon.org/hackathon/cipdhack/why-adaptabily-matters-now">competition </a>to "hack" the human resources function to enable organizational adaptability. As real space and cyberspace merge, do financial practices like <a href="http://www.managementexchange.com/story/taking-reality-seriously-towards-more-self-regulating-management-model-statoil">budgeting </a>provide value over their costs of time, money, effort, agility? All the parts of the organization have to come together and build a common language to discuss their markets and their enterprise. They need to have a common appreciation of each other's purpose. The CIO must step up and mentor the C-suite on the potentials, possibilities, threats and opportunities of information technology, but likewise, the HR lead needs to discuss the impact of a free-agent workforce, the head of legal needs to discuss the impacts of open innovation and IP sharing, and so on. <br />
<strong><br />
As IT steps up as mentor, it needs to mature as well. </strong>IT needs to step up, but collaboratively &#8212; not as the smartest guys in the room. One commentator said, "About 10 years ago, IT people suddenly became business process experts. Strategy in IT is one thing, but the process experts suddenly began giving advice about areas in which they were not experts and honestly felt they should lead strategic planning for the entire organization." If IT and the CIO come to the party talking like engineers, only offer convergent lines of thought (analytical, rational, quantitative, sequential, constraint driven, objective and detailed focus) and don't offer a more holistic, shaded divergent thinking point of view (creative, intuitive, qualitative, subjective, possibility driven, holistic with conceptual abstractions), then they have missed the point. </p>

<p><strong>CEOs sense the problem perhaps more than CIOs do.</strong> This is a totally unscientific finding, but it is what I experienced during the two weeks of article-writing and the culminating <a href="http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/events/2013/05/change-the-conversation-change.html">webinar</a>, in which I engaged directly or indirectly with a large number of CIOs, IT managers and CEOs. There were a significantly larger number of CIO/IT conversations that took place in conference or meeting situations, and the CEOs generally self-selected by reaching out to discuss or gather more information. Unless I pointed out the topic, many of the IT people were generally unaware or just tangentially aware. The CEOs were actively aware, concerned, looking at alternatives such as chief digital officers, or creating "not-so-shadow" IT organizations under the CMO. Few of the conversations originated with IT people, unless they were already engaged in trying to address the issues (another self-selection bias?). A number of the conversations started with the assumption that social engagement, collaboration and analytics were not part of IT, but the responsibility of marketing.<br />
<strong><br />
The bifurcation of IT and business is a myth.</strong> There have been two paths of discussion around this. One is the concept of alignment. The other is the idea that as IT socially enables companies, the actual concept of management and how we organize and structure work as practiced today begins to <a href="http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments">disappear</a>. There were numerous discussions around COBIT and ITIL &#8212; popular IT process- and service-management frameworks &#8212; and there is a lot that COBIT in particular offers. But too often, it turns alignment into supplication or worse, subservience. The CIO must understand and execute on the differences among leadership, governance, and managing. The CIO must lead by showing the way IT can impact the organization both positively and negatively, sometime leading by how technology is applied in IT itself, then influence and guide the organization in making the right decisions. Then the CIO must direct and restrain the use of technology - how it is developed, sourced and applied in the best interests of the organization and its stakeholders with appropriate governance mechanisms. Lastly, the CIO must execute by managing the procurement, provisioning, monitoring and management of the delivery and application of IT to serve the organization. Several discussions focused in on understanding the difference between delivering IT and applying IT. If you are delivering IT, then you are a surrogate IT company that might not be aligned with the enterprise. If you are applying IT to the business, then by definition you have to be aligned with the business, or fail.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple roles, one company versus one role, multiple companies. </strong>Historically, people got to the C-suite by progressing up the career ladder in one discipline, moving among multiple companies until they made it to an executive role in finance, sales, etc. Now, however, the model is changing. In successful companies, top executives rotate among multiple disciplines in increasing levels of responsibility until they advance to the C-suite. Leaders then have a multi-disciplinary understanding of the organization, rather than an exclusive, deep knowledge of just one area. And as we are learning, good leaders do not have to be discipline-specific if they engender trust and responsibility in their organization. Many CEOs expect their next CIO to come from marketing instead of their or another IT shop.</p>

<p>I started looking into the role of the CIO with the assumption that the onus was on CIOs to step up IT's game to enable their enterprise to succeed in the future. One observation from all this is that there is an endemic problem across the C-suite: there has been such a long-standing culture of domain and functional specialization focused on efficiency that the overall gestalt of the business and its efficacy at creating and maintaining a customer has been lost. </p>

<p>But that doesn't relieve CIOs of their responsibility to change IT to enable the business to better change. For aspiring CIOs, the best thing for your career is to leave IT and move to other departments &#8212; even if it involves taking a step back. Preferably, these roles need to be part of the value chain, facing either customers or partners, and eventually both. Then, step back into IT. This idea could be true for all departments &#8212; for instance, new business managers should come from outside the business function to encourage a holistic view of the business.</p>

<p>For existing CIOs, ask yourself a few questions. Are you generating customer value? Are you (or do you have the potential to be) the best in the world at what you are doing? Are you required to do what you are doing? Using the answers to those questions, what do you need to stop doing, start doing or do differently? Where are you spending your time interacting and relating to the rest of the organization? What resources should you have and how should you allocate them? What activities consume most of your efforts and what outcomes are you expecting from them? And lastly, what are you really focusing on and what questions are really driving you? </p>

<p>The point of all this is to pose these questions to everyone in the C-suite &#8212; not necessarily to be answered, but to start the collaborative, co-creative process to discover the answers and to continue the conversation.</p>

      <p>Does your team have a difficult time making decisions that everyone supports? If so, you may be suffering from a lack of curiosity. </p>

<p>Try this: Next time you're in a team meeting, count the number of times you make a statement and the number of times you ask a question. If you're like most team leaders, you'll find that you make many more statements than ask questions and some of the questions you ask aren't really questions.</p>

<p><a href="http://enablersnetwork.com/2009/marcial-losada-explains-his-research-for-our-blog-readers/">Research</a> shows that in effective teams, members share their own views and ask others their views. By combining transparency and curiosity, teams keep the discussion focused, get all the information on the table, learn why members have different views, and create solutions that take into account all team members' perspectives. As a result these teams have stronger performance and better working relationships.</p>

<p>When leaders learn that they aren't asking question, they often overcompensate by asking a lot of questions and withholding their own views. This leaves team members feeling interrogated rather than engaged.</p>

<p>Not all questions are created equal. To develop an effective team, it's not enough to ask questions. You have to be genuinely curious.  When you are genuinely curious, you ask questions to learn what others are thinking. When you aren't genuinely curious, you ask questions to make a point: rhetorical questions.</p>

<p>See if you can tell which of the following questions are genuine and which are rhetorical:</p> 
<ol>
	<li>"You don't really think your solution will work, do you?"</li>
	<li>"If we implemented my proposal, what problems, if any, would it create in your divisions?"</li>
	<li>"Why do you think I asked you to follow up yesterday?"</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions 1 and 3 are rhetorical: they don't really ask for an answer but implicitly state the speaker's own views or ask you to guess what the speaker is thinking. Asking rhetorical questions demonstrates a lack of both curiosity and transparency.</p>

<p>Rhetorical questions can feel good to ask. They are a way to score some quick &#8212; and often clever &#8212; verbal points. But rhetorical questions undermine your team's working relationships and reduce its ability to make high-quality decisions. Rhetorical questions enable you to ask others to be accountable without being transparent about your own views, leading team members to feel insulted, defensive, or discounted. As a result, team members trust you less, withdraw from the discussion, and withhold relevant information that the team needs to make good decisions.</p>

<p>Here are a few questions you can ask yourself to determine whether what you are about to ask is a genuine question (like question 2 above.) If you answer yes to any of the following questions, the question you're about to ask isn't genuine.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do I already know the answer to my question?</li>
	<li>Am I asking the question to see if people will give the right (preferred) answer?</li>
	<li>Am I asking the question to make a point?</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to figure out if you're about to ask a rhetorical question is to give yourself what I call the "You Idiot" test. Here's how it works:</p>

<blockquote>Privately say to yourself the question you plan to ask. For example, during your team meeting your direct reports have just told you that they will miss the final deadline and incur additional costs on a key project, the very outcomes you were trying hard to avoid. Feeling frustrated, you're tempted to respond, "Why do you think I asked you to finish the work before the end of this fiscal year?"

<p>At the end of your private question, add the words "you idiot." Now you're saying to yourself, "Why do you think I asked you to finish the work before the end of this fiscal year, you idiots?" <br />
 If the question still sounds natural with "you idiots" at its end, don't ask it. It's really a statement &#8212; a pointed rhetorical question. </p>

<p>Change the question to a transparent statement that shares your view, including your reasoning and your feelings. Then add a genuine question that helps you learn more about the situation. In this case you might say, "That really bothers me because it already puts next year's budget at risk. Help me understand; what happened to make project expenses spill over into next fiscal year?"</blockquote></p>

<p>Shifting from rhetorical to genuine questions may be more difficult than it seems. That's because the questions you ask and the statements you make are driven by your mindset: the set of core values and assumptions that unconsciously guide your behavior. </p>

<p>If you're operating from a <a href="http://www.schwarzassociates.com/managing-performance/how-unilateral-control-undermines-team-results-and-relationships-2/">unilateral control</a> mindset, rhetorical questions enable you to control your team, by telling them (implicitly) what you think and not allowing them to influence you. </p>

<p>If you're operating from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Leaders-Smarter-Teams-Unstuck/dp/0787988731/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1366292194&sr=8-1&keywords=smart+leaders+smarter+teams">mutual learning</a> mindset, you are both curious and transparent. You are curious: you see each team member as having a different piece of the puzzle you all need to solve, so you ask genuine questions to elicit information and ideas. You are transparent: you express your point of view, clearly and explicitly &#8212; not disguised in a rhetorical question. By being transparent about your own concerns and curious about your team members' experiences and perspectives, you improve working relationships, develop more creative solutions, and achieve more accountability and commitment to decisions from all team members.</p>

<p>So check your questions: are you asking rhetorical ones? </p>

      <p>By 2050 the number of people living in cities will have nearly doubled, from 3.6 billion in 2011 to more than 6 billion. Yet the world's urban areas are already overcrowded and, particularly in developing countries, suffer from shortages of clean water, electricity, and other resources essential to the support of their exploding populations and fragile economies.</p>

<p>The problems created by rampant urbanization are among the most important challenges of our time. They also represent one of the greatest opportunities &#8212; and responsibilities &#8212; for the private sector. </p>

<p>Before your company starts investing in this area, it's important to consider how your resource-efficiency initiatives measure up on both technological and financial sophistication. The products and services that new cities will require, and that provide the return investors and entrepreneurs need, optimize both. </p>

<p>Your potential offerings can be positioned according to these characteristics on an "efficiency matrix." The matrix is useful for determining the current strategic position of a company's products, services, and investments, but it's most valuable for envisioning where the company might profitably head. It's explained below:</p>

      <p>Do people with bleak economic prospects hold more tightly to their money? No, they're more likely to gamble it away, says a team led by Michael J.A. Wohl of Carleton University in Canada. In an experiment, people were <strong>more than twice</strong> as likely to gamble $10 on slot machines if they first read an article warning of an unstable economic climate, poor job prospects, and higher costs. Periods of hardship can lead people to make risky and detrimental financial decisions, the researchers say.</p>

      <p>GE's "<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/12/the-insourcing-boom/309166/">insourcing</a>" of appliance manufacturing to the U.S. has been trumpeted as a major reversal of the trend of sending jobs abroad to lower cost locations, and has been characterized in the press as a kind of "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=onshoring&oq=onshoring&aqs=chrome.0.69i57j0l3.2413j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">onshoring</a>" story. I see it differently: as a "NUMMI deja vu" story. You may recall that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUMMI">NUMMI </a>was a joint venture of Toyota and GM, where Toyota took over one of GM's worst plants and turned it around with a new management system &#8212; using many of the same people and the same unions. GE's insourcing is actually quite similar. So, how did GE do it?<br />
 <br />
First, a little relevant history: In the 1950s economic expansion drove growing demand for appliances. To meet this demand, GE created GE Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky, which reached a peak of 23,000 employees in 1973. In the early 2000s, as part of a huge offshoring trend in the business economy, GE shifted manufacturing to suppliers such as Samsung and LG. But these suppliers became competitors and ever-harder to work with. Then at the end of 2007 the housing market crashed. By the summer of 2008 GE leadership wanted to sell the appliances business or spin it off.<br />
 <br />
During that difficult time Dirk Bowman, former GE Appliances General Manager of Manufacturing, went to GE Chairman Jeff Immelt with a proposal. Bowman aimed to increase manufacturing capability and bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. from Korea, China, and Mexico. Immelt asked why production should be put in old factories in a union environment. Dirk's answer was: "We can save on transportation and be closer to our customers. We can have engineering work more closely with production. We can work smarter than Korea, China, and Mexico, using 15-20% of the labor they use." Immelt was convinced, and GE Appliances got a <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/print-edition/2012/01/13/ge-invests-more-than-1-billion-to.html?page=all">$1 billion investment</a>.<br />
 <br />
The challenges GE faced were daunting. If the goal was to leapfrog the competition in every product line while revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, management had to take a big swing. The $1 billion plan envisioned 11 new product platforms in six different manufacturing sites. GE needed to reduce new product development cycles from 3-4 years to 1-1.5 years. The plants had been on life support, so they needed major repairs. The workplace was divided into functional areas; no one knew how to work together. All the laboratory equipment had been given away. The only people left were tough survivors, so the bench was not deep. The company needed to rebuild expertise and capabilities. It needed to recruit huge numbers of people in a short period of time. It needed to invest in new development labs and to co-locate teams.<br />
 <br />
In the summer of 2009 management decided to bring production of a water heater back to the U.S. from an Asian contractor. GE manufacturing leaders started applying <a href="http://www.ge.com/audio_video/ge/innovation/lean_manufacturing_ge_appliance_park_louisville_kentucky.html">"Lean" thinking and tools</a> to a "model line" for manufacturing in Appliance Park. They introduced a new cross-functional team structure for improvement &#8212; the "Big Room." Functions were seated together with a common goal: working on the value stream from consumer research to testing. They put the schedule up on the wall so everybody knew what was happening. There was a fishbone diagram of the production flow (the backbone was the main flow, and the branches were the sub-assemblies), and a cardboard mockup of the factory layout which also showed how the equipment would look. At 7:45 a.m. each day leaders met, then at 8:00 a.m. everyone met to review the prior day, and what they would do that day. Then at 4:15 p.m. everyone met again to review what they'd done. The water heater that resulted was a new design, with better performance: 20% fewer parts and 50% less labor. Inventory was reduced 60%, labor efficiency improved 30%, time-to-produce was reduced 68%, and space required for the line came down by 80%. </p>

<p>The development team was extremely cohesive. But the problem was, the culture needed to change outside the "Big Room" and very few cultural change efforts had been made since 1994. Employees were anxious: the business had been up for sale in 2008 and 2009, and there had been little to no investment in plants or training. The purpose of their work was being redefined through continuous improvement, but the clarity across functions and among the workforce was fuzzy. </p>

<p><strong>As the leadership began to introduce a new way of working together it had to solidify trust in the workforce and instill a level of confidence that continuous improvement was not just another initiative that would pass. This would be a journey.</strong> </p>

<p>To spread the new culture more broadly, management decided to form another cross-functional team (a "Little Big Room") to define tenets about how they would operate. A team of 16 curious, honest, and bold people &#8212; including production operators and leaders from HR, engineering, purchasing, operations, and training &#8212; were selected. Everyone who joined the team had to leave his or her job for four months. They visited the furniture manufacturer Herman Miller and auto supplier <a href="http://www.autoliv.com/Pages/default.aspx">Autoliv </a>to see what mature Lean operations looked like. They saw hourly workers deeply engaged in reviews of operational performance measures, solving complex problems. The GE team developed a purpose and nine guiding principles &#8212; the "Appliances Performance System." The biggest shift was to focus on making work better for front line operators and put everyone else in support of operators...shifting the paradigm to <em>support </em>versus command and control.<br />
 <br />
To further shift the culture, Dirk Bowman made a commitment that nobody would lose his or her job due to Lean, but that everybody's job would change every day. The union president echoed the same message. The union acted as a second set of leaders to help execute and reinforce changes. To demonstrate their deep commitment, in December 2011 GE rolled out team leader training. GE Appliances now has a dedicated <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/video/2008/12/the-importance-of-learning-in.html">learning organization</a> that in 2012 trained 3,000 employees on the fundamentals of the Appliances Performance System.<br />
 <br />
So, while the macro story may be about jobs coming back "onshore," at its core this is really a process and a culture story. GE Appliances is proving once again that the balance of process and people, aligned with a clearly articulated and understood purpose and vision, is the source of improved performance and capability development. With leadership engagement and support, this system will thrive.<br />

      <p>Even a brief interaction can change the way people think about themselves, their leaders, and the future. Each of those many connections you make has the potential to become a high point or a low point in someone's day. Each is a chance to transform an ordinary moment into a touchpoint. </p>

<p>What is a touchpoint? A touchpoint is an interaction with one other person, a couple of people, or a group that can last a couple of minutes, a couple of hours, or a couple of days. Those Touchpoints can be planned or spontaneous, casual or carefully choreographed.   </p>

<p>Every touchpoint is spring-loaded with possibilities. Each one can build &#8212; or break &#8212; a relationship. </p>

<p>For instance, when I was a first year graduate student at the J. L. Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University taking a Management Policy class. My professor, Ram Charan, noticed that my schoolwork was starting to slip. I was not only taking a full load of classes but I was also working two jobs. I was stretched pretty thin. One day, Ram called me aside and said, <strong>"You can do better."</strong> Those four words inspired me to hold myself to a higher standard. I remember those words as if they were spoken yesterday and that was over 35 years ago. </p>

<p>Shortly after I graduated, I accepted a job with General Mills. Like many people starting a new job in a new place, I was completely lost in the building. This older man saw me stumbling around and said, "Young man... you look lost. How can I help?" I asked him if he could help me find my way back to the marketing department.  He pointed the way and said, "So you work in the marketing department. If there is one thing that I want to leave you with is that you've got to <strong>give it all you've got</strong>." We then went our separate ways. Ultimately, I saw this man's picture a couple of weeks later and discovered that he was Jim McFarland, the CEO and Chairman of General Mills. Those five words inspired me to lean into my work with greater intensity. I carry them with me today. </p>

<p>I had been with General Mills for six months and I was up for my first performance review. I was struggling to hit the ground running. I had never worked in an office environment before in my life. Here I was, unmistakably a rookie. During the performance review, my manager offered this observation, "Doug, you are clearly very determined to contribute here but, quite frankly, your work is very mediocre." That comment, in and of itself, was something I was able work through. Next, I was to receive feedback from my boss's boss. In this case, he had written six words down on a piece of paper to be read to me. Those words were, <strong>"You should look for another job."</strong> This was the first performance review I had received in my life and my boss's boss, whom I thought was a god, just told me to go look for another job. He wasn't inclined to give me the time of the day or the benefit of the doubt. I was devastated and very anxious but ultimately I played through it. Those six words reminded me that the corporate journey is not for the faint of heart. You must bring great resolve to your work. It's not all a bed of roses. </p>

<p>I persevered through some difficult times as I was starting up my career and I was promoted to Product Manager at General Mills in a very timely way. Within 48 hours of that promotion, I received a call from my wife's grandfather, Mr. R. T. Johnstone. R.T., a man I admired greatly, said, <strong>"I'm so proud of you."</strong> Those five words of encouragement reminded me that I was not alone on this journey, as difficult as it was. My family was, is and will always be with me. Those words ring in my ears to this day.</p>

<p>After six years of working in the General Mills food group, I transferred over to the General Mills toy group. Three years in, I lost my job. I've shared this experience <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/03/what_losing_my_job_taught_me_a.html">in great detail here before</a>. After I was let go from General Mills, I went to an outplacement counselor; a man by the name of Neil MacKenna. Every time Neil would answer the phone he would say, "Hello, this is Neil MacKenna, how can I help?" With those four words, <strong>"How can I help?"</strong> Neil changed my entire work life. He helped me see beyond my own agenda to discover the fulfillment of starting every interaction with a desire to be helpful. This was a very powerful lesson, delivered in four words. It took all of two seconds. </p>

<p>On July 2, 2009, I was involved in a very serious automobile accident. I was traveling to my home in Northern New Jersey for the Fourth of July weekend. I was in the back of a Lincoln Navigator asleep with my seat belt on when, while going at least 70 miles an hour, we ran into the back of a stopped dump truck on the New Jersey Turnpike. It was a very serious accident. I was taken to a nearby trauma center and went through an extensive array of surgical procedures. Understandably, I was pretty much out of it for 24 hours. When I woke up in the intensive care unit my wife, Leigh, who had been helping my daughter move into her apartment in Washington D.C., was right by my side. And all she said were three words. She said, <strong>"I'm right here."</strong> Those three words, said in one second, connected me in a powerfully indescribable way with my wife and my recovery. I'll never forget the moment.</p>

<p>Over the following 40 days, as I was recovering from the automobile accident, I had been moved from the ICU to the trauma center then to a hospital and finally to a rehabilitation program. I dealt with nurses in all four of these facilities that, time and again, reaffirmed for me the power of touchpoints &#8212; that they're not just about the words you say, they're about how you say them. </p>

<p>There was the same protocol over all four facilities. In this case, every nurse would come into my room and ask me the same question: "How is your pain?" When the nurses were fully prepared and exceptionally gifted at managing patients they could come into the room and dial-in in a very thoughtful and genuine way. But with nurses who were new to the profession, new to the facility, or who just felt a little bit uncomfortable getting into a conversation, I would quickly realize that those four words weren't about me; it was about how they were going to handle me. It was about them. Those conversations were always awkward.</p>

<p>So, those four words, <strong>"How is your pain?"</strong> opened up a world that was magical when it was well managed. But when not well managed, the resulting awkwardness could completely undermine the effectiveness of the nurse. Those four words reaffirmed the power of touchpoints. </p>

<p>There you have it:<br />
<ul><br />
	<li>Seven memorable touchpoints</li><br />
	<li>32 words total</li><br />
	<li>Less than five words per Touchpoint</li><br />
	<li>Strung together, it's generously 20 seconds of conversation</li><br />
	<li>That's approximately four seconds per touchpoint</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>Despite their brevity, those seven touchpoints have had a profound impact on my life. I encourage each of you to look for opportunities to have a profound impact on the next touchpoint you encounter. You have the opportunity to make a tremendous impact on the lives of the people with whom you work and live. Make the most of it. The next touchpoint is right around the corner &#8212; use it wisely.</p>

            Working From My Bean Bag Chair Treadmill Desk<br />
            
            That's what everyone's favorite late CEO did when he designed Pixar's offices in 1986. Instead of putting the bathrooms (and café and mailboxes and gift shop) off to the side, Steve Jobs placed them in an atrium at the center of the workspace. And "although some were more than a little annoyed to have to traipse to the lobby every time they needed the loo &#8212; something remarkable started to happen," writes <em>The Independent's</em> Archie Bland. "Pixar’s employees started to bump into each other. They shot the breeze. Sometimes, the chatter would yield something useful, and one of the participants would head back to her desk with a new idea." And now everyone wants to be like Apple. Bland ventures into the West London headquarters of juice and smoothie maker Innocent to witness  "a benevolent, juice-obsessed cult, teetering on the border between charming and insufferable; that is, like an Innocent smoothie bottle with desks in it." While perhaps an extreme example, this type of setup is prized by the likes of Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer, who says that people are "more collaborative and innovative when they’re together. Some of the best ideas come from putting two different ideas together." And recent research found that people are happier when they have different options for where and how to work. But does that actually lead to productivity &#8212; and, perhaps most important, to profit? Maybe not. Dish Network is often cited as <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-02/dish-network-the-meanest-company-in-america">one of the most hostile workplaces in America</a> and still boasts outstanding numbers. So goes this winding article, with no real answers but with lots of important questions that will shape how we work in the future.

			<h4><a href="http://www.inc.com/eric-markowitz/sec-lifts-ban-on-general-solicitation.html" class="titlelink"> Finally: SEC Lifts Ban on Advertising Fundraising Rounds  <em>Inc. </em></a></h4>
          <p class="main">
            Until now, start-ups in the U.S. couldn't advertise themselves as investment opportunities through traditional media to nonaccredited investors. If they wanted to sell stock, they had to do it through official financial channels such as angel investor groups. That made it hard for start-ups to raise money from ordinary investors, and hard for ordinary investors, especially those outside VC hotbeds such as Silicon Valley, to put money into promising new businesses. But the Securities and Exchange Commission, prodded by recent legislation, voted this week to lift its ban on what's known as "general solicitation" of fundraising rounds. Now entrepreneurs will be allowed to solicit investments through new channels, provided they vet investors. The big complaint about the ruling is that it creates new bureaucratic obstacles to selling stock. But the upside is big: Entrepreneurs living outside tech hubs may find it easier to connect with investors and grow their startups without having to relocate, says <em>Inc</em>. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-10/sec-lifts-ban-on-hedge-funds-advertising-dot-hilarity-ensues">Cue the Twitter jokes</a>. <em>&#8212; Andy O'Connell</em>

          <p class="main">
            Why is it that when you attend a strategy meeting, everyone who isn’t nodding off to sleep seems be nodding in agreement, at least on the basics? It's not because everyone really <em>does</em> agree; it's because companies don't know how to handle reasoned disagreement, says Aneel Karnani of the University of Michigan. It's rare for companies to value internal debate. One positive example he cites is a company that typically identifies five pressing issues and assigns two managers to each, telling them to explore different avenues. In the end, one approach is chosen for each problem. The key to opening the floor to dissent is to depersonalize the discussion. Argue about ideas, not people. That way you get robust, constructive debate that can help your company choose the right strategy. "The 'Let's all be team players' and 'Let's pull together' thinking can be a trap," Karnani says. "Strategy comes from internal debate, even dissent." I don't disagree. <em>&#8212; Andy O'Connell</em>

          <p class="main">
            Imagine, for a moment, the CEO of a major company sitting alone in his South Florida mansion. You run a division of his company and can only see him via video conference. Your job is to convince him to give you money to fund your retail operation, and not others in the company. He barely pays attention, until he disagrees with what you’re saying. Then he berates you for an hour. Now imagine that this is reality at Sears. In this fascinating and slightly hard-to-believe story, Mina Kimes explains why Eddie Lampert runs Sears like a hedge fund, splitting the operation into 30 independent divisions with their own CEOs, CMOs, and boards. Former execs say it's created chaos and infighting. Lampert counters: "Decentralized systems and structures work better than centralized ones because they produce better information over time." Meanwhile, Sears continues to record losses while attempting to reinvent shopping on digital devices. There are also these tidbits: Lampert makes his first CEO entrance at a shareholder meeting to the tune of Maroon 5's "Moves Like Jagger." He created a social network for Sears employees on which he used the pseudonym "Eli Wexler." And he's really into Ayn Rand.

          <p class="main">
            Praising people makes them &#8212;  and you &#8212;  feel good, so why not be liberal about doling out the ego-buffing compliments? Because if you praise people the wrong way, you can prompt them to unconsciously increase what's known as "escalation of commitment" &#8212; the tendency to stick with a course of action even after it's been discredited, writes Wharton professor Adam Grant. In an experiment, when people who had been praised for their decision-making skills made a choice about whether to keep investing in a bad choice (in this case, a bad hire), they were 40% more likely to escalate their commitment to the new employee than people who hadn't been praised. Makes sense: If you've been told you're a great decision maker, you <em>must</em> have made a good decision, so you'd better stick with it. But people who had been praised instead for their creativity were 40% <em>less</em> likely to escalate their commitment than those who hadn't been praised. Since they had been induced to feel good about something other than their decision making, these people were willing to admit to having made poor choices. Any time you give positive feedback for a particular skill or trait, the praisee is at risk for becoming overconfident in that domain. <em>&#8212; Andy O'Connell</em>

      <p>How do you become truly influential? We've found that the most highly respected leaders avoid techniques to gain short-term compliance; they also steer clear of a self-centered "How can I get people to do what I want?" mindset. Instead, they take a different approach altogether. </p>

<p>We interviewed over 100 high-impact influencers from a wide range of industries and organizations for our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Real-Influence-Persuade-Without-Pushing/dp/081442015X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1362197324&sr=8-1&keywords=real+influence">recent book</a>. To achieve real influence, they tend to follow four steps that turn typical persuasion strategies upside down. These steps are action guidelines all of us can use to get things done with people in ways that not only yield great results, but also strengthen relationships and enhance credibility.  </p>

<p>In previous articles we covered <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/02/to_have_real_influence_focus_o.html">Step 1: Go for great outcomes</a>, <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/03/for_real_influence_use_level_f.html">Step 2: Listen past your blind spots</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/04/how_to_really_understand_someo.html">Step 3: Engage others in "their there."</a></p>

<p>In this post we cover Step 4: <em>When you've done enough... do more.</em></p>

<p>Think back to the last time you helped someone very important in your life achieve a goal. Maybe you helped a friend with a business venture, participated in planning a wedding, or pitched in when a son or daughter moved to a new city.</p>

<p>When you offered your help, we bet you didn't say, "I'll take a few minutes to offer some advice, but for more than that you'll have to do something for me." </p>

<p>Instead, you spent hours running errands, hanging decorations, or moving furniture. You volunteered for messy, difficult, or time-consuming chores like cleaning the fridge or carefully writing 300 names on 300 place cards.</p>

<p>Why? Because you automatically do more for the people you care about deeply. In fact, you usually don't even stop to think about it. It comes naturally to you because your relationships with these people matter and you want to strengthen them.</p>

<p>Of course, these relationships are special; they mean more to you than a business connection or a relationship with a casual friend. But in any relationship, you can go beyond what's expected. When you do this, you make a statement about who you are as a person and a professional.</p>

<p>Our friend Kouji Nakata describes it this way: "It's about not being the main attraction. You look for the angle of help; look for the angle of assistance. It's like being a caring relative, like an uncle who really is taking an interest in his nephew. Look for the way that they can shine and help them do it. Don't be the important piece. Step aside, get alongside them, and help them do great things and help them be happy."</p>

<p>When you do this, you set the stage for positive influence both now and in the future. "Overdelivering" makes you stand out in the moment and makes people remember you later. You become locked in as someone who deserves to be listened to, and people don't wonder whether you have ulterior motives or hidden agendas.</p>

<p>Doing more isn't just a onetime thing but an ongoing practice. For maximum effect, you'll want to focus on three distinct times when you can do more: <em>before</em>, <em>during</em>, and <em>after </em>an interaction. </p>

<p>When you begin interactions in this way &#8212; by doing more, and sometimes even taking a risk in the process &#8212; you form instant bonds with people who are tired of being ripped off, manipulated, or given the bare minimum of service. You prove immediately to these people that you have integrity. And they tell other people, who tell still more people. </p>

<p>In fact, you can "do more" for people who have no connection with you at all. Think of this as committing "random acts of doing more."</p>

<p>David Bradford, former CEO of Fusion-IO, fell into a great outcome by doing exactly that. Here's the story behind his break-through addition of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak to Fusion-IO, which helped drive the organization's phenomenal success.</p>

<p>David didn't target "Woz." Instead, one of David's random acts of doing more led to a cascade of positive results.</p>

<p>David, who at the time was living in Utah, had a friend whose son was moving into the state and could use some help setting up his law practice. David obliged, helping get the young man connected and raising his visibility in the state.</p>

<p>A few months later, because of this connection, David received a request to speak at the Utah Bar Association. It was in Sun Valley, a five-hour drive for him, and he'd be speaking to a relatively small group. Many people would have considered it a complete waste of time. But David cheerfully agreed.</p>

<p>After the speech, he stayed for lunch. As it turned out, the keynote speaker was Steve Wozniak. Chance led Wozniak's executive assistant to sit right next to David. She observed that Wozniak would probably enjoy the opportunity to speak with him, joking that he'd welcome "a kindred spirit from the information technology world in a room full of lawyers," and she was right &#8212; they struck up a conversation. </p>

<p>It turned out that Woz had his eye on solid-state trends that Fusion-IO was exploring. Later David sent him materials and asked if he'd like to be a part of the advisory board. Wozniak said yes, and then went on to take the role of chief scientist.</p>

<p>Just random chance? Maybe. But in the bigger picture, the David Bradfords of the world don't think of it as blind chance. They think, "That's how it works." It's about a mindset that starts not with results, but with relationships. You may not have any clue where those relationships will lead . . . but that's part of the excitement of real influence.</p>

<p>When you do more, always remember that you're not "giving to get." Never see your actions as a prelude to springing an uncomfortable request on another person. Instead, understand that your goals are to build long-term relationships and to make things better.</p>

<p>If you've noticed in yourself  a "zero sum" mentality, work to move beyond it. It's holding you back. Instead, think of the times in your own life when people have done more for you. How can you pay forward to others the positive influence these people gave you? How can you do more for people before, during, and after the projects you're currently planning?</p>

<p>When you find ways to help other people learn, grow, gain, avoid problems, make progress, and achieve their goals, you achieve something far more important than near-term gain. You form the basis for ongoing results, enriched relationships, and an integrity-based reputation. </p>

<p>And that will lead &#8212; in wonderful ways you can't even begin to predict right now &#8212; to real, lifelong influence.</p>

      <p>In 1973, Peter Drucker stated in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Management-Responsibilities-Practices-Peter-Drucker/dp/0887306152">Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices,</A> "Management is not culture-free, that is, part of the world of nature. It is a social function. It is, therefore, both socially accountable and culturally embedded." </p>

<p>Some thirteen years later, Tom Peters remarked in the article <a href="http://www.tompeters.com/column/1986/005163.php">Managing As Symbolic Action</a>: "It requires us, as managers, to get people to share our sense of urgency in new priorities; to develop personal, soul-deep animus toward things as they are; to get up the nerve and energy to take on the forces of inertia that bog down any significant change program."</p>

<p>Yet, here we are in 2013 with organizational leadership models that continue to deny the social nature of organizations and wallow in inertia.</p>

<p>Our leadership practices remain authoritative. People are disengaged, distrusting and perhaps even disenfranchised.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.edelman.com/insights/intellectual-property/trust-2013/">2013 Edelman Trust Barometer</a>, fewer than 20% of respondents believe leaders are actually telling the truth when confronted with a difficult issue in their organizations. Furthermore, a study conducted by the Human Capital Institute and Interaction Associates in 2013 found only 34% of organizations had high levels of trust in the places they work. And, a paltry 38% reported that their organizations had effective leadership running the show.</p>

<p>To cap off a small sliver of dismal data points, research firm Gallup found that over a twelve-year period between 2000 and 2012, the percentage of engaged employees in the workforce has shifted between 26% and 30%. That is, roughly 70% of employees in today's organizations have spent more than a decade essentially collecting a pay check, an almost Shakespearean spectacle of tragic ambivalence. </p>

<p>What if our approach to leadership was to evolve into Drucker's vision of "socially accountable and culturally embedded" management? </p>

<p>Cam Crosbie is the CIO of Equitable Life Insurance Company of Canada, represented by more than 10,000 independent producers across Canada and Bermuda. Cam completely understands the need to "lead without authority." He does so, quite simply, by asking questions rather than barking orders. Before moving forward with a big decision or a large project, Cam makes a practice of asking lots of questions, including, as he says, "even the so called 'dumb ones'".  </p>

<p>As a CIO, Cam believes it's important to reach out to others and inquire before pushing ahead. Cam said, "I hope that in some small way if people see the CIO unashamedly asking the simple questions, it clears the way for clearer and more meaningful discussion." Perhaps the first step toward a better future for your organization is to acknowledge that you don't necessarily know the way there &#8212; and, just as important, to understand that by asking questions, you not only awaken and engage people, you stand to collect more valuable perspective and ideas than you would by starting from a position of authority. </p>

<p>Leadership isn't a 9-5 job &#8212; it's communal, it's holistic and it's accretive. It's time to abandon the long-held notion that the "leader" knows all and should decide everything. A fancy title doesn't put you above others &#8212; it puts you in their service.</p>

<p>TELUS, a national telecommunications company in Canada, with $11 billion of annual revenue and more than 40,000 employees worldwide (and where I am head of learning and collaboration), has worked incredibly hard over the past five years to raise employee engagement from 53% to 80%. It did so through myriad actions including the launch of the TELUS Leadership Philosophy. The TLP is an enterprise-wide leadership framework that cultivates a collaborative, social, open and engaging mindset among all employees regardless of rank or title. It encourages all employees to "engage and explore" with one another before "executing." It defines key behavioral attributes such as communicating, collaborating, learning, deciding and adapting such that everyone can speak the same leadership language. </p>

<p>In mid-2010, an internal program was born at TELUS entitled Customers First. The overarching goal of the program was to improve the likelihood that TELUS customers would recommend the company. As the program began to gain traction, another idea surfaced: Customer Commitments. Think of the commitments as customer promises &#8212; specific actions that any TELUS team member would carry out to help a customer regardless of role.</p>

<p>Instead of locking its most senior executives in a room to decide what the Customer Commitments were going to be for the organization, we designed a collaborative process that involved the entire organization. Over 1,000 different examples surfaced over a two-month period. Through focus groups, interactive online polling and voting, the 1,000 were whittled down to a final four. </p>

<p>If the culture at TELUS was one that relied on authoritative leadership, the Customer Commitments would have been created in a couple of hours by a few authoritative leaders. Because the culture was healthy, open and participative as opposed to dogmatic and ruthlessly hierarchical, the organization collaborated without authority. This is the work of leadership today: asking questions, involving people, connecting them to each other, creating a platform for their insights and ideas to make a real impact &#8212; in other words, unleashing leadership behavior everywhere.</p>

<p>In this moment of reflection, as we seek to redefine the work of leadership, let us remember the words of Nelson Mandela:</p>

<blockquote>"[Ubuntu is] the profound sense that we are human only through the humanity of others; that if we are to accomplish anything in this world it will in equal measure be due to the work and achievements of others."</blockquote>

<p>If you're lonely at the top, it's time to start recognizing and amplifying the contribution of those around you. </p>

      <p>If you're a manager working with the analysts in your organization to make more data-driven business decisions, asking good questions should be one of your top priorities. Many managers fear that asking questions will make them appear unintelligent about quantitative matters. However, if you ask the right kinds of questions, you can both appear knowledgeable and advance the likelihood of a good decision outcome.</p>

<p>In my new book (co-authored with Jinho Kim) <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Keeping-Up-Quants-Understanding-Analytics/dp/142218725X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1372686010&sr=1-1&keywords=keeping+up+with+the+quants">Keeping Up with the Quants</a></em>, and in <a href="http://hbr.org/2013/07/keep-up-with-your-quants/ar/1">a related article</a> in this month's HBR, we list a lot of possible questions for various stages of analysis. But in this short article, I thought it might be useful not only to mention a couple of the most important questions you can ask about data, but what some of the ensuing dialogue might involve. </p>

<p><strong>1.Questions about Assumptions</strong></p>

<p><em>You ask:</em> What are the assumptions behind the model you built? </p>

<p><em>You think in response to their answer:</em>  If they say there are no particular assumptions, you should worry &#8212; because every model has assumptions behind it. It may be only that you're assuming that the sample represents a population, or that the data gathered at a previous time are still representative of the current time. </p>

<p><em>Follow-up:</em> Is there any reason to believe that those assumptions are no longer valid?</p>

<p><em>You think in response:</em> You are really looking only for a thoughtful response here. The only way to know for sure about whether assumptions still hold is to do a different analysis on newly-gathered data &#8212; which could be very expensive. Perhaps a particular relationship only holds when the values of a variable are moving in a particular direction (e.g., "this mortgage risk model only holds true when housing prices are going up &#8212; nah, that could never change!").</p>

<p><strong>2. Questions about Data Distribution</strong></p>

<p><em>You ask:</em> How are the data you gathered distributed? </p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/simplescatter.gif"><img alt="Scatterplot" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/simplescatter-thumb-200x231-4369.gif" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></p>

<p><em>You think in response:</em> If the person can't describe the distribution, he or she is a shoddy analyst. Good analysts should have already looked at &#8212; and be able to show you &#8212; a visual display of the distribution of your data on any particular variable.<br />
 <br />
If you are interested in one variable as a likely predictor of another, ask for a "scatterplot" and look to see if the data line up in any linear pattern; that would indicate a strong correlation between the two variables.  </p>

<p><em>Follow-up:</em> Do the data follow a normal distribution? </p>

<p><em>You think in response:</em> If the analyst says that the data aren't distributed normally (i.e., in a bell-shaped curve), then he or she needs to employ different types of statistics (called "<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonparametric-statistics.asp">nonparametric</a>" statistics), and some commonly-used ones like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09kiX3p5Vek">standard deviations</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence">correlations</a> don't apply. </p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/normaldistribution.gif"><img alt="Normal Distribution " src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/normaldistribution-thumb-200x231-4371.gif" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>You might ask how they adjusted their analysis based on the distribution. For example, nonparametric tests often require a larger number of cases for the same level of statistical confidence.</p>

<p><em>Second follow-up:</em> Were there any significant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier">outliers</a>?</p>

<p><em>You think in response:</em> If the data are normally distributed but there are some outliers (unexpected values that don't fit the pattern), you could ask what they might mean, and what the analyst plans to do with them. In some cases it may be reasonable to delete outliers &#8212; if, for example, they are the result of coding errors.</p>

<p>You get the picture. It's important to show with this dialogue that you are interested, somewhat knowledgeable, and dedicated to a good decision outcome. You're not trying to suggest with such questions that you know more than the analyst, or that the analyst is hiding anything from you. It's the same sort of conversation that a CEO might have with a division manager who is presenting financial results. Gentle probing is the desirable tone.</p>

      <p>Undergraduates who had gazed at their 40-year-old selves in virtual "mirrors" were <strong>74% less</strong> likely to cheat for extra cash on a subsequent trivia test, says a team led by Jean-Louis van Gelder of the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement and Hal E. Hershfield of NYU. This and another experiment suggest that one reason people make self-defeating choices such as engaging in unethical behavior is that their ability to imagine their future selves is limited. They're less inclined to indulge in illegal acts if they can see vivid images of themselves such as the computer simulations presented by the researchers. See Hershfield's "Defend Your Research" <a href="http://hbr.org/2013/06/you-make-better-decisions-if-you-see-your-senior-self/ar/1">interview </a>in the June 2013 HBR.</p>

      <p>The prospects for investors, be they corporate pensions, sovereign wealth funds, or individuals, appear bleak. John Authers, <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/efa26a96-e98f-11e2-bf03-00144feabdc0.html">in Thursday's <em>FT</em></a>, musters up the evidence (or at least the opinions) that bonds and stocks are both likely to deliver paltry returns for years to come. Sheelah Kolhatkar, in a <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-11/why-hedge-funds-glory-days-may-be-gone-for-good">cover story</a> (and what a <em>classy</em> cover it is) in the new <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>, argues that the great alternative to plain-vanilla equity and debt investing &#8212; the hedge fund &#8212; is more or less over, too. And London Business School's Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton, in a Credit Suisse report cited by Authers that's a few months old but it is <a href="http://www.investmenteurope.net/digital_assets/6305/2013_yearbook_final_web.pdf">well worth downloading and taking the time to read</a>, make a pretty convincing case that the equity and bond returns that came to be perceived in the U.S. as "normal" in the decades following World War II &#8212; and particularly since 1980 &#8212; are anything but.</p>

<p>We're all pretty well aware of the negative consequences of low investment returns, although perhaps not of the specifics. Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton calculate that a 25-year-old entering a defined-contribution retirement savings plan &#8212; such as a 401(k) in the U.S. &#8212; needs to set aside 16% to 20% of her income <em>(!)</em> if she hopes to retire at age 65 at half salary.</p>

<p>Still, where there are losers, there are winners. "While a low-return world imposes stresses on investors and savers in an over-leveraged world recovering from a deep financial crisis," Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton write, "it provides essential relief for borrowers." The biggest borrowers these days are governments, and because governments possess powers that most borrowers don't, they are often able to cut their borrowing costs at the expense of creditors through a variety of techniques that Harvard economist Carmen Reinhart dubs "<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-11/financial-repression-has-come-back-to-stay-carmen-m-reinhart.html">financial repression</a>."</p>

<p>Financial repression doesn't sound like a good thing, and in some ways it isn't. But the great global recovery after World War II was accomplished in an environment of artificially low interest rates and capital controls &#8212; that is, financial repression. So it doesn't have to be bad economic news. Sometimes governments actually use the money they borrow wisely.</p>

<p>Then there are the other tradeoffs inherent in investment returns. Over time, Rob Arnott and Peter Bernstein demonstrated in a <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/abs/10.2469/faj.v58.n2.2524">great 2002 article in the <em>Financial Analysts Journal</em></a>, stock market returns should and do trail economic growth. That's because:<br />
<blockquote>Shareholders can expect to participate <em>only in the growth of the enterprises they are investing in</em>. An important engine for economic growth is the creation of new enterprises. The investor in today's enterprises does not own tomorrow's new enterprises &#8212; not without making a separate investment in those new enterprises with new investment capital.</blockquote></p>

<p>So when U.S. stock market returns outpace economic growth, that money has to come from somewhere. It can be taken out of workers' paychecks, creditors' pockets, or government coffers. It can come from overseas, as U.S.-based companies take advantage of faster growth elsewhere. And it can come from the future, as investors bet on faster growth to come.</p>

<p>During the great bull market of 1981 to 2001, all of these factors played a role. I'll focus on workers' paychecks. Labor's share of income actually didn't drop all that much over those two decades &#8212; in part because of big increases in worker pay (including a lot of stock-option jackpots) in the final years of the 1990s boom. But <a href="http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/commentary/2012/2012-13.cfm">the longer-term trend since the 1960s has been of a significant decline in the percentage of total income going to workers</a>, one that has accelerated over the past decade &#8212; during which stocks have sputtered but bond investors have done quite well.</p>

<p>So here's the big if. If those low investment returns that everybody's projecting are low just because the global economy keeps sputtering, that's not good news for anybody. If, however, they signal a regime change in which the financial sector's great rise over the past few decades begins to reverse and other sectors &#8212; governments and workers mainly, although there are certainly business sectors that have lagged as well &#8212; grab a greater share of economic growth, that doesn't have to be a bad thing at all.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, I'll admit, this amounts to saying that if times are bad they'll be bad, and if they're good they'll be good. But it's important to draw the link between two important and seldom-connected discussions: one about the prospects for investment returns, the other about <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/time-to-bypass-modern-finance-by-j--bradford-delong">the proper role of finance and capital in the economy</a>. Because if the financial sector shrinks in relative size, and working stiffs gain a greater share of national income &#8212; both of which would be healthy developments, I think &#8212; the share of economic growth going to investors will have to decline.</p>

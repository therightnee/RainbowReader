      <p>I feel genuinely badly for Barnes & Noble and its recently <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324507404578594152838322728.html">resigned CEO William Lynch</a>.  It has done by far the best job of anybody in the industry as traditionally constructed &#8212; and that is just not good enough. I don't think B&N can be accused of blindness. When it built out its vast network of stores, there really wasn't a meaningful threat from online sales or digital books. People bought books in bookstores, and B&N built the best chain of bookstores, bar none. <br />
 <br />
It is even hard to say that when Amazon came along, B&N should have followed suit immediately and committed to an on-line model. It is not at all clear to me that B&N had any of the skills, capabilities, talent, or experience to become a successful on-line bookseller.  Yes, it could have done an Amazon me-too, but as a legacy player, they would have never been given the ultra-cheap capital that Amazon has always had. And shareholders would have excoriated B&N for not making the earnings on its retail network that their high expectations dictated. <br />
 <br />
So I suspect that B&N was largely fated to be sideswiped by a fundamental paradigm shift in its industry and, while better than Borders, heading smartly in the same direction. <br />
 <br />
What would I do if I were running B&N today?  Good question.  I probably would take a close look at what Indigo, the B&N of Canada, is trying to do. It is attempting to become a lifestyle shopping destination in categories in which books play a consequential part but extending far past books. Categories like house and home, cooking, kids, babies, paper and self-help are tied to big book categories. Indigo can have a legitimate hope of creating a shopping experience across the category that integrates books-and-beyond in a compelling enough way to get enough traction with customers to fill up the store.  <br />
 <br />
It is probably a long shot and B&N probably has a lot more locations than this approach could support. But it is a way of utilizing the book heritage to provide a shopping experience that no one, including Amazon, would be able to match.  <br />
 <br />
And if I were to do it, I would use the approach that Harrod's employs. Most people do not realize that while Harrod's looks like a store, it is actually a mini-mall with each merchandise area leased out to an independent seller &#8212; an extension of the model that department stores use with their cosmetics/skin care floor.  <br />
 <br />
I would turn each B&N into a mini-mall in which each individual category is run by a lessee who is expert in that particular category.  B&N would act as the systems integrator, putting together a multi-category offering that attracts sufficient customers into the mini-mall.  It would also use its book-buying experience and power to stock each lessee with the book inventory required for their category assortment. <br />
 <br />
Would I bet my own money on this approach?  I probably would not. But it may be superior to the other legitimate alternative, which is to liquidate B&N now and return to capital-holders whatever net proceeds can be accumulated (if any can).  But wait.  There is always private equity.  Maybe they should call <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/william-ackman/">Bill Ackman</a> and see whether he wants to give the category another go.</p>

      <p>New data on employee engagement is in, and it's downright discouraging. As <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/hbr/hbreditors/2013/06/ten_charts_that_show_weve_all_got_a_case_of_the_mondays.html">this post</a> by HBR's Gretchen Gavett noted, Gallup's research shows that engagement among US workers is holding steady at a scant 30%. This means seven out of ten people are either "checked out", or actively hostile toward their employers. <em>Seven</em> out of <em>ten</em>.</p>

<p>Study after study shows that employee engagement, an index of bringing one's best and full self to work, is not just an organizational nicety. It is a business imperative, linked to a number of performance outcomes, including profitability, customer satisfaction and turnover. A <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/organization/pdfs/state_of_human_capital_2012.ashx">2012 report on human capital</a> from McKinsey added to the evidence, noting that organizations with top scores in employee motivation are about 60% more likely to be in the top quartile for overall business health. Companies I work with in my consulting practice who have done their own internal research have found similar linkages. </p>

<p>Of course, engagement is an emotional and deeply personal experience; it's not simple or straightforward to address. But leaders must do so, for the sake of not only their employees but also their companies. Here are pointers to help you to make real inroads in this area:</p>

<p><strong>Understand the basics of positive psychology and engagement research. </strong> At the end of her post, Gavett refers to <a href="http://hbr.org/2003/01/one-more-time-how-do-you-motivate-employees/">an HBR classic</a> on employee motivation, in which the famed management psychologist Frederick Herzberg argued that workers respond positively to more responsibility and authority in their daily tasks. This finding is resonant with <a href="http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/">self-determination theory</a>, a well-established research program in psychology that has identified the universal human need for autonomy. In other words, people generally do well when they are empowered to make choices and decisions for themselves. Plenty <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&UID=2011-03454-004">more research</a> has been done on work engagement, showing that factors such as social support and feedback can drive positive experience. Managers and HR professionals need to understand these and other robust psychological theories to more effectively shape their engagement efforts.  A wealth of information is out there, ready to be put to good use.</p>

<p><strong>Find out what engages your employees, not someone else's.</strong>  While broad research is a valuable resource, it can only take an organization so far.  No theory or model is useful in the abstract. What matters is <em>your </em>business and <em>your</em> people. Ironically, most organizations use engagement results punitively; they focus on what is going wrong, and on why people aren't as engaged as they could be. A better approach is to figure out what's already working in your business, and find ways to replicate it. Go to the most engaged individuals, teams and business units, and help others model what they do. I've used this approach to help businesses identify a unique "engagement signature" suited to their culture and context.</p>

<p><strong>Encourage grassroots engagement. </strong> Engagement cannot be mandated, but it can be ignited. Once you understand what matters to your employees, you can support its expression and replication far and wide. Empower your people, particularly the most engaged employees, to share stories, exchange ideas and disseminate best practices across the business. A well-designed piece of media, such as a video "starring" members of a thriving business unit, can gain traction and become a source of encouragement for others. With the rise of social media and digital workplace technologies, it's easier than ever to connect employees and make engagement contagious. </p>

<p><strong>Recognize engagement as a moving target, and check back often.</strong>  While certain elements of employee engagement will surely hold over time, it's not something that can be assessed and addressed just once. Research shows that <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&UID=2010-06187-003">engagement fluctuates daily</a>, and with changing circumstances.  What engages people during a surge in business may be very different from what helps them bring their best selves to work in a recession. To keep your organization engaged, you must remain engaged, curious, and connected yourself.<br />
     <br />
The next time Gallup or McKinsey do their polls, I'd like to see those engagement scores rise. What would it take to engage half, three quarters or 100% of the workforce?  Imagine what it would mean to business success, employee happiness and productivity. <br />
 <br />
What are you doing about employee engagement, and what can you share with others?  Let's begin the conversation today.</p>

      <p>Imagine crafting a sustainable career for yourself. Year after year, you perform work that makes full use of your skills and challenges you to develop new ones. Your work not only interests you, it gives you a sense of meaning. You enjoy opportunities for learning and development. You work with people who energize you. You are confident that your skills and competencies make you valuable and marketable and that you can access opportunities through your network. You are able to fit your work together with the other things in your life that are important to you, like family, friends, and leisure. </p>

<p>This is a rosy picture, to be sure; some would even call it unattainable. For a taste of what is usually associated with the word career, check out the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=career">Urban Dictionary's definition</a>, which characterizes a career as "an affliction whose symptoms are loss of life & liberty, general purpose misery, and resentment towards those who are unaffected" and "a euphemism for 'professional labor camp.'" </p>

<p>The entry is facetious, yet it does point to an undeniable truth: many employees spend the better part of their waking hours engaged in work that gives them nothing more than pay. "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation," wrote Henry David Thoreau in <em>Walden </em>in 1854. Today, over two-thirds of employees are disengaged at work, according to a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/strategicconsulting/163007/state-american-workplace.aspx">recent Gallup survey</a> of 150,000 workers. Economic stagnation and unequal access to opportunity keep a sustainable career out of reach of many. Even among the socioeconomically privileged, investment in education, hard work, and commitment to a company is no guarantee of career success and fulfillment. </p>

<p>However, there are steps you can take to maximize your chances of enjoying sustainable career success over the long term. Consider the example of Dan, who worked as sales engineer in the late 1990s for a company that developed voice recognition technology &#8212; a perfect fit for his background in and passion for linguistics and computer science. A few years later, the firm merged with its chief competitor. While Dan's job title remained unchanged, his responsibilities shifted in an unfavorable direction. Instead of the more creative work of synthesizing customer needs into technical solutions, at which he excelled, he was tasked primarily with developing proposals and statements of work. Not only did this work fail to capitalize on his strengths, it frustrated him and required skills he lacked. Thus, Dan found himself in a common catch-22: wanting to move into a position that would better fit his skills profile and enable him to recapture his outstanding job performance; he faced diminished prospects of mobility within the firm because he was underperforming at his new responsibilities. Furthermore, given the recent merger, this low point occurred at a time when he needed to demonstrate his value to managers from the acquiring company who weren't familiar with his track record. </p>

<p>To craft his career, Dan explored options for performing interesting work that exploited his talents and offered room for career growth while also increasing the value he provided to his company. He scoured the internet for information about other firms in the industry and found that many competitors employed solution architects, a position that didn't exist in his company at the time. Having gained broad experience with the development and deployment of voice recognition solutions in various contexts over the years with his employer, he realized that the solution architect role would both suit his existing skill profile and work preferences while also increasing his impact in the firm and opening up paths for increased learning. In addition, his research suggested that the role would support the company's strategic objective to take a dominant market position in the rapidly-growing market for voice recognition technology in mobile devices. </p>

<p>Using his respected industry knowledge, market insight, and professional network, he developed a proposal to create a solution architect. He explained how the new position could also enhance retention of high-value employees by providing an alternate career path for other sales engineers who were seeking opportunities for growth within the company. He used evidence from performance appraisals and multi-source feedback to demonstrate that his qualifications matched the position's requirements. </p>

<p>Management accepted his proposal and appointed him to the newly created position, an opportunity that kept him learning, engaged, and performing at his peak, which in turn ultimately led to a promotion a few years later. As expected, the role proved valuable for the company, which in turn hired additional solution architects from outside and promoted other employees into the position.</p>

<p>If you'd like to craft your own career, try out these strategies, which I recommend in my career management courses and workshops:<br />
<ul><br />
	<li>Embrace the fact that you are the pilot of your career. No one else has direct access to your ambitions, interests, and values, and no one is going to take you by the hand and help you create a fulfilling career. The more you practice career crafting, the better you get at it.</li><br />
	<li>Develop a discipline of identifying and documenting the ways in which you add value to your employer. Spend a few minutes at the end of each week to record what you've learned and accomplished as well as to record feedback received. Just 5-10 minutes of systematic effort weekly will soon yield a rich archive of material that you can use to deepen your self-awareness, hone your career goals, and document your value.</li><br />
	<li>Link your accomplishments to your career goals. Discuss your goals with your manager periodically, even if this process is not formalized. Maintain positive, productive relationships with people who can help you to access opportunities.</li><br />
	<li>Pay close attention to developments in your industry and to the strategic direction of your firm. Understand your firm's core competencies &#8212; the parts of its operation that drive its competitiveness in the marketplace &#8212; and make sure that you play a contributing role. Look for ways to get involved in growth areas. </li><br />
	<li>Seek opportunities to work with people who energize you. Many of my executive students recount that their biggest career boosts have come from working alongside smart, energetic, connected people who have taken an interest in them. These productive opportunities are much more likely to occur when you actively seek them out.</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>A sustainable career is dynamic and flexible; it features continuous learning, periodic renewal, the security that comes from employability, and a harmonious fit with your skills, interests, and values. The keys to crafting a sustainable career are knowing yourself &#8212; what interests you, what you do best and not so well, what energizes you &#8212; and being acutely attuned to the fields and companies you're interested in, so that you can identify places where you can add value. The "follow your passion" self-help industry tends to under-emphasize this key point: all of the self-awareness in the world is of little use if you can't pitch your passion to a buyer. A sustainable career is built upon the ability to show that you can fill a need that someone is willing to pay for. This holds not only when you're starting a business or looking for a new job; it's also an important springboard for refining your current job and your career trajectory to make it more ideal.<br />

      <p>The fastest-growing segments of America's job market &#8212; by far &#8212; are temporary and part-time employment.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of US part-time employees <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/9/new-us-economy-part-time-and-temp-job-markets-expl/">hit a record high</a> of 28 million. Temporary employment has <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/07/temporary-jobs-becoming-permanent-fixture/2496585/">jumped 50%</a> since the depths of the financial crisis. This "ephemeral workforce" phenomenon isn't just American; <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/16/record-number-of-part-time-workers-in-uk-as-unemployment-falls-by-50000-601858/">the UK has also set records</a> in the contingently employed. Something profoundly structural is going on. Even healthier economic growth won't make it go away. </p>

<p>More companies want far greater flexibility with far fewer people. Their greatest human capital concerns have shifted. They seem increasingly focused on productively <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/schrage/2012/10/the-coming-collapse-of-average.html">cultivating that core 20% to 25% of people who reliably generate the 70% to 80% of enterprise value</a>. They're rethinking their economic relationships with the rest.</p>

<p>Workflows and innovation initiatives have been artfully reorganized around "projects" to facilitate faster, cheaper and easier contingent participation. Technology makes reviewing, refining, redesigning and revising both jobs and job descriptions as dynamic as a commodities trading desk.</p>

<p>Have people been commoditized?  Of course not.  But the ways people's knowledge, skills and expertise get plugged into the workplace has been. For roughly half of America's workforce, the role, rules and requirements of "the job" are dramatically different than they were even a decade ago. Just ask anyone working in the health care, financial services, automobile, retail, media, publishing, education, advertising, real estate or defense industries. </p>

<p>It's not that troubled economies and disruptive innovations inherently <a href="http://www.aei.org/article/economics/the-astonishing-collapse-of-work-in-america">shed more jobs </a>than they create; it's that ongoing global restructuring of markets makes <a href="http://www.realclearmarkets.com/video/2013/07/08/temporary_jobs_the_new_normal.html">temporary and/or part-time employment more attractive for more organizations</a>. Outside of the enterprise core group, bringing full-time employees onboard is increasingly seen as a riskier and less rewarding business bet.</p>

<p>And higher education isn't offering the human capital cure.  A recent <a href="http://mckinseyonsociety.com/downloads/reports/Education/UXC001%20Voice%20of%20the%20Graduate%20v6.pdf">McKinsey & Co. study</a> suggests that almost <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/12/college-degree-study_n_3263055.html">half of recent college graduates are working in jobs that don't really require a degree</a>. Do we really believe MBA or law degree credentials would better procure their full-time employment?</p>

<p>As <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/schrage/2010/07/hireless-recovery.html">this blog</a> observed literally three years ago: "Most people looking for a job today aren't competing against each other. They're competing against alternative ways to getting that job done. For most organizations, people are a means and medium to an end. They're not hiring employees, they're hiring value creation. If they can get that value &#8212; or most of it &#8212; from contingency workers, outsourcing, automation, innovative processes or capital investment, why wouldn't they? If [technically] tweaking a process or program empowers three people to do the work of five, then tweakonomics is the way to go. The profound difference between today [2010] and 2005 is that good hires looked like better investments than great tweaks back then. In 2010, good tweaks look like better bets than even great hires."</p>

<p>The "New Permanent Temporary" has arguably been the biggest employment change since I wrote that post. Like Smartphones, part-timerism's global growth proliferates. In fact, temps with Androids and iPhones already use services like <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-24/gigwalk-does-temp-worker-hiring-without-job-interviews">Gigwalk</a> and LinkedIn to more profitably find and manage their part-time and/or temporary work. Amazon has its below-the-radar "<a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/">Mechanical Turk</a>" workplace market. For the gainfully underemployed, everyday is BYOD; their technologies are becoming their toolkits. Technology doesn't just facilitate automation and innovation; it makes contingent, temporary and part-time job markets more efficient and effective.</p>

<p>The economic irony for both sides of the enterprise equation is that maximizing the value of part-time employment has become a full-time job. Employers from WalMart to PepsiCo to Adecco to Microsoft pay premiums to assure their armies of independent contractors and temps cost-effectively get the job(s) done. Conversely, serious part-timers quickly learn that productively juggling several temporary positions requires more skill than luck. </p>

<p>Holding the uncertainties around Obamacare, government regulation, automation and/or economic growth responsible for full-time employment aversion misses the larger point. The rise of part time jobs means the absence of full-time commitment. Growing number of employers are increasingly committed to not being committed.  </p>

<p>It's analogous to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/04/living/women-premarital-cohabitation">the demographic rise in cohabitation</a> before marriage: the nature and expectations around formal commitment are being redefined. Just as cohabitation doesn't necessarily lead to marriage, temporary and contingent employment doesn't necessarily lead to full-time jobs.</p>

<p>The most serious question going forward is not simply whether or how more full time jobs return, it's whether or how part-time and temporary workers become more valuable. <strong>Will employers invest in developing the knowledge, human capital and capabilities of their contingent workforces and independent contractors? </strong>Or is the new "permanent temporary" merely about a fair day's work for a fair day's pay? </p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/33851/free-agent-nation">Daniel Pink's <em>Free Agent Nation </em></a>and <a href="http://hbr.org/1998/09/the-dawn-of-the-e-lance-economy/ar/1">Tom Malone's <em>E-Lance Economy</em> </a>argued well over a decade ago, the innovatively self-employed can earn handsome livings if they're willing to adapt, invest in themselves and learn. <strong>But who invests in the not-as-innovative and not-quite-as-adaptable part-time worker? </strong>Who is their <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Salman Khan</a>? What are their media and mechanisms for becoming more valuable?</p>

<p>As the brilliant economist, Treasury Secretary and former Harvard University President Larry Summers <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/06/neoliberalism">once observed</a>, "In the history of the world, no one has ever washed a rented car." If this implies that no employers will invest in the upgrade of their "rented" temps and part-timers, that bodes very poorly for this rising class of worker.</p>

<p>My bet? Underemployed assets are frequently undervalued assets. Undervalued assets attract savvy investors and entrepreneurs.  Prepare for the <em>next </em>New Permanent Temporary.</p>

      <p>Enterprise IT is in crisis &#8212; no doubt about it. Our research, conducted in partnership with Harvard Business Review, The Economist, CEB (formerly the Corporate Executive Board), Intel, and TNS Global, finds that corporate leadership has lost confidence in the CIO as a strategic partner and views IT as a commodity rather than a difference-maker.  </p>

<p>Clearly the roles of CIO and the IT organization need reinvention &#8212; and that's the <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/04/corporate_it_and_the_conversat.html">conversation </a>we've been having over the last few months in webinars and posts. (See also <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/04/how_cios_can_keep_in_step_with.html">here</a>, <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/05/the_metamorphosis_of_the_cio.html">here</a>,  and <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/05/three_ways_cios_can_connect_with_the_c-suite.html">here</a>.) This conversation has generated a lot of interesting conversation via blog comments, emails, and face-to-face interactions at conferences and meetings and has revealed a few more insights that should factor into our evolving thinking. </p>

<p><strong>CIOs need to understand business better, but the C-suite should understand technology's potential better. </strong>While the CIO needs to understand the business to add value, equally true is that senior leadership and the board of directors don't understand how to incorporate technology in their strategy, and some don't even see the need to do so. As gerajohm commented, "The best executives I have met have had a great understanding of how to use technology to gain competitive advantage and improve operations. They also worked with the CIO to help them to understand the business. They worked together to identify the technologies that could improve the company's competitive advantage versus technologies that were needed to support the business. Once this was done, the executive leadership and CIO focused on implementing technologies that improve the company's competitive advantage."<br />
<strong><br />
Every other function of the organization is as out of touch as IT.</strong> <a href="http://www.victoriomilian.com/">Victorio M.</a> commented, "Reading this post is both humorous and disheartening. Humorous because, as a Human Resources practitioner, I hear similar calls for change within my profession. So it's not just us! Yet it's disheartening because it's yet another organizational function that appears to not be able to keep up with the pace of business, staying stuck in a transactional, as opposed to strategic, frame of mind." The Management Innovation Exchange is currently running a <a href="http://www.mixhackathon.org/hackathon/cipdhack/why-adaptabily-matters-now">competition </a>to "hack" the human resources function to enable organizational adaptability. As real space and cyberspace merge, do financial practices like <a href="http://www.managementexchange.com/story/taking-reality-seriously-towards-more-self-regulating-management-model-statoil">budgeting </a>provide value over their costs of time, money, effort, agility? All the parts of the organization have to come together and build a common language to discuss their markets and their enterprise. They need to have a common appreciation of each other's purpose. The CIO must step up and mentor the C-suite on the potentials, possibilities, threats and opportunities of information technology, but likewise, the HR lead needs to discuss the impact of a free-agent workforce, the head of legal needs to discuss the impacts of open innovation and IP sharing, and so on. <br />
<strong><br />
As IT steps up as mentor, it needs to mature as well. </strong>IT needs to step up, but collaboratively &#8212; not as the smartest guys in the room. One commentator said, "About 10 years ago, IT people suddenly became business process experts. Strategy in IT is one thing, but the process experts suddenly began giving advice about areas in which they were not experts and honestly felt they should lead strategic planning for the entire organization." If IT and the CIO come to the party talking like engineers, only offer convergent lines of thought (analytical, rational, quantitative, sequential, constraint driven, objective and detailed focus) and don't offer a more holistic, shaded divergent thinking point of view (creative, intuitive, qualitative, subjective, possibility driven, holistic with conceptual abstractions), then they have missed the point. </p>

<p><strong>CEOs sense the problem perhaps more than CIOs do.</strong> This is a totally unscientific finding, but it is what I experienced during the two weeks of article-writing and the culminating <a href="http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/events/2013/05/change-the-conversation-change.html">webinar</a>, in which I engaged directly or indirectly with a large number of CIOs, IT managers and CEOs. There were a significantly larger number of CIO/IT conversations that took place in conference or meeting situations, and the CEOs generally self-selected by reaching out to discuss or gather more information. Unless I pointed out the topic, many of the IT people were generally unaware or just tangentially aware. The CEOs were actively aware, concerned, looking at alternatives such as chief digital officers, or creating "not-so-shadow" IT organizations under the CMO. Few of the conversations originated with IT people, unless they were already engaged in trying to address the issues (another self-selection bias?). A number of the conversations started with the assumption that social engagement, collaboration and analytics were not part of IT, but the responsibility of marketing.<br />
<strong><br />
The bifurcation of IT and business is a myth.</strong> There have been two paths of discussion around this. One is the concept of alignment. The other is the idea that as IT socially enables companies, the actual concept of management and how we organize and structure work as practiced today begins to <a href="http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments">disappear</a>. There were numerous discussions around COBIT and ITIL &#8212; popular IT process- and service-management frameworks &#8212; and there is a lot that COBIT in particular offers. But too often, it turns alignment into supplication or worse, subservience. The CIO must understand and execute on the differences among leadership, governance, and managing. The CIO must lead by showing the way IT can impact the organization both positively and negatively, sometime leading by how technology is applied in IT itself, then influence and guide the organization in making the right decisions. Then the CIO must direct and restrain the use of technology - how it is developed, sourced and applied in the best interests of the organization and its stakeholders with appropriate governance mechanisms. Lastly, the CIO must execute by managing the procurement, provisioning, monitoring and management of the delivery and application of IT to serve the organization. Several discussions focused in on understanding the difference between delivering IT and applying IT. If you are delivering IT, then you are a surrogate IT company that might not be aligned with the enterprise. If you are applying IT to the business, then by definition you have to be aligned with the business, or fail.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple roles, one company versus one role, multiple companies. </strong>Historically, people got to the C-suite by progressing up the career ladder in one discipline, moving among multiple companies until they made it to an executive role in finance, sales, etc. Now, however, the model is changing. In successful companies, top executives rotate among multiple disciplines in increasing levels of responsibility until they advance to the C-suite. Leaders then have a multi-disciplinary understanding of the organization, rather than an exclusive, deep knowledge of just one area. And as we are learning, good leaders do not have to be discipline-specific if they engender trust and responsibility in their organization. Many CEOs expect their next CIO to come from marketing instead of their or another IT shop.</p>

<p>I started looking into the role of the CIO with the assumption that the onus was on CIOs to step up IT's game to enable their enterprise to succeed in the future. One observation from all this is that there is an endemic problem across the C-suite: there has been such a long-standing culture of domain and functional specialization focused on efficiency that the overall gestalt of the business and its efficacy at creating and maintaining a customer has been lost. </p>

<p>But that doesn't relieve CIOs of their responsibility to change IT to enable the business to better change. For aspiring CIOs, the best thing for your career is to leave IT and move to other departments &#8212; even if it involves taking a step back. Preferably, these roles need to be part of the value chain, facing either customers or partners, and eventually both. Then, step back into IT. This idea could be true for all departments &#8212; for instance, new business managers should come from outside the business function to encourage a holistic view of the business.</p>

<p>For existing CIOs, ask yourself a few questions. Are you generating customer value? Are you (or do you have the potential to be) the best in the world at what you are doing? Are you required to do what you are doing? Using the answers to those questions, what do you need to stop doing, start doing or do differently? Where are you spending your time interacting and relating to the rest of the organization? What resources should you have and how should you allocate them? What activities consume most of your efforts and what outcomes are you expecting from them? And lastly, what are you really focusing on and what questions are really driving you? </p>

<p>The point of all this is to pose these questions to everyone in the C-suite &#8212; not necessarily to be answered, but to start the collaborative, co-creative process to discover the answers and to continue the conversation.</p>

      <p>Does your team have a difficult time making decisions that everyone supports? If so, you may be suffering from a lack of curiosity. </p>

<p>Try this: Next time you're in a team meeting, count the number of times you make a statement and the number of times you ask a question. If you're like most team leaders, you'll find that you make many more statements than ask questions and some of the questions you ask aren't really questions.</p>

<p><a href="http://enablersnetwork.com/2009/marcial-losada-explains-his-research-for-our-blog-readers/">Research</a> shows that in effective teams, members share their own views and ask others their views. By combining transparency and curiosity, teams keep the discussion focused, get all the information on the table, learn why members have different views, and create solutions that take into account all team members' perspectives. As a result these teams have stronger performance and better working relationships.</p>

<p>When leaders learn that they aren't asking question, they often overcompensate by asking a lot of questions and withholding their own views. This leaves team members feeling interrogated rather than engaged.</p>

<p>Not all questions are created equal. To develop an effective team, it's not enough to ask questions. You have to be genuinely curious.  When you are genuinely curious, you ask questions to learn what others are thinking. When you aren't genuinely curious, you ask questions to make a point: rhetorical questions.</p>

<p>See if you can tell which of the following questions are genuine and which are rhetorical:</p> 
<ol>
	<li>"You don't really think your solution will work, do you?"</li>
	<li>"If we implemented my proposal, what problems, if any, would it create in your divisions?"</li>
	<li>"Why do you think I asked you to follow up yesterday?"</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions 1 and 3 are rhetorical: they don't really ask for an answer but implicitly state the speaker's own views or ask you to guess what the speaker is thinking. Asking rhetorical questions demonstrates a lack of both curiosity and transparency.</p>

<p>Rhetorical questions can feel good to ask. They are a way to score some quick &#8212; and often clever &#8212; verbal points. But rhetorical questions undermine your team's working relationships and reduce its ability to make high-quality decisions. Rhetorical questions enable you to ask others to be accountable without being transparent about your own views, leading team members to feel insulted, defensive, or discounted. As a result, team members trust you less, withdraw from the discussion, and withhold relevant information that the team needs to make good decisions.</p>

<p>Here are a few questions you can ask yourself to determine whether what you are about to ask is a genuine question (like question 2 above.) If you answer yes to any of the following questions, the question you're about to ask isn't genuine.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do I already know the answer to my question?</li>
	<li>Am I asking the question to see if people will give the right (preferred) answer?</li>
	<li>Am I asking the question to make a point?</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to figure out if you're about to ask a rhetorical question is to give yourself what I call the "You Idiot" test. Here's how it works:</p>

<blockquote>Privately say to yourself the question you plan to ask. For example, during your team meeting your direct reports have just told you that they will miss the final deadline and incur additional costs on a key project, the very outcomes you were trying hard to avoid. Feeling frustrated, you're tempted to respond, "Why do you think I asked you to finish the work before the end of this fiscal year?"

<p>At the end of your private question, add the words "you idiot." Now you're saying to yourself, "Why do you think I asked you to finish the work before the end of this fiscal year, you idiots?" <br />
 If the question still sounds natural with "you idiots" at its end, don't ask it. It's really a statement &#8212; a pointed rhetorical question. </p>

<p>Change the question to a transparent statement that shares your view, including your reasoning and your feelings. Then add a genuine question that helps you learn more about the situation. In this case you might say, "That really bothers me because it already puts next year's budget at risk. Help me understand; what happened to make project expenses spill over into next fiscal year?"</blockquote></p>

<p>Shifting from rhetorical to genuine questions may be more difficult than it seems. That's because the questions you ask and the statements you make are driven by your mindset: the set of core values and assumptions that unconsciously guide your behavior. </p>

<p>If you're operating from a <a href="http://www.schwarzassociates.com/managing-performance/how-unilateral-control-undermines-team-results-and-relationships-2/">unilateral control</a> mindset, rhetorical questions enable you to control your team, by telling them (implicitly) what you think and not allowing them to influence you. </p>

<p>If you're operating from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Leaders-Smarter-Teams-Unstuck/dp/0787988731/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1366292194&sr=8-1&keywords=smart+leaders+smarter+teams">mutual learning</a> mindset, you are both curious and transparent. You are curious: you see each team member as having a different piece of the puzzle you all need to solve, so you ask genuine questions to elicit information and ideas. You are transparent: you express your point of view, clearly and explicitly &#8212; not disguised in a rhetorical question. By being transparent about your own concerns and curious about your team members' experiences and perspectives, you improve working relationships, develop more creative solutions, and achieve more accountability and commitment to decisions from all team members.</p>

      <p>By 2050 the number of people living in cities will have nearly doubled, from 3.6 billion in 2011 to more than 6 billion. Yet the world's urban areas are already overcrowded and, particularly in developing countries, suffer from shortages of clean water, electricity, and other resources essential to the support of their exploding populations and fragile economies.</p>

<p>The problems created by rampant urbanization are among the most important challenges of our time. They also represent one of the greatest opportunities &#8212; and responsibilities &#8212; for the private sector. </p>

<p>Before your company starts investing in this area, it's important to consider how your resource-efficiency initiatives measure up on both technological and financial sophistication. The products and services that new cities will require, and that provide the return investors and entrepreneurs need, optimize both. </p>

<p>Your potential offerings can be positioned according to these characteristics on an "efficiency matrix." The matrix is useful for determining the current strategic position of a company's products, services, and investments, but it's most valuable for envisioning where the company might profitably head. It's explained below:</p>

      <p>Do people with bleak economic prospects hold more tightly to their money? No, they're more likely to gamble it away, says a team led by Michael J.A. Wohl of Carleton University in Canada. In an experiment, people were <strong>more than twice</strong> as likely to gamble $10 on slot machines if they first read an article warning of an unstable economic climate, poor job prospects, and higher costs. Periods of hardship can lead people to make risky and detrimental financial decisions, the researchers say.</p>

      <p>GE's "<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/12/the-insourcing-boom/309166/">insourcing</a>" of appliance manufacturing to the U.S. has been trumpeted as a major reversal of the trend of sending jobs abroad to lower cost locations, and has been characterized in the press as a kind of "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=onshoring&oq=onshoring&aqs=chrome.0.69i57j0l3.2413j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">onshoring</a>" story. I see it differently: as a "NUMMI deja vu" story. You may recall that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUMMI">NUMMI </a>was a joint venture of Toyota and GM, where Toyota took over one of GM's worst plants and turned it around with a new management system &#8212; using many of the same people and the same unions. GE's insourcing is actually quite similar. So, how did GE do it?<br />
 <br />
First, a little relevant history: In the 1950s economic expansion drove growing demand for appliances. To meet this demand, GE created GE Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky, which reached a peak of 23,000 employees in 1973. In the early 2000s, as part of a huge offshoring trend in the business economy, GE shifted manufacturing to suppliers such as Samsung and LG. But these suppliers became competitors and ever-harder to work with. Then at the end of 2007 the housing market crashed. By the summer of 2008 GE leadership wanted to sell the appliances business or spin it off.<br />
 <br />
During that difficult time Dirk Bowman, former GE Appliances General Manager of Manufacturing, went to GE Chairman Jeff Immelt with a proposal. Bowman aimed to increase manufacturing capability and bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. from Korea, China, and Mexico. Immelt asked why production should be put in old factories in a union environment. Dirk's answer was: "We can save on transportation and be closer to our customers. We can have engineering work more closely with production. We can work smarter than Korea, China, and Mexico, using 15-20% of the labor they use." Immelt was convinced, and GE Appliances got a <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/print-edition/2012/01/13/ge-invests-more-than-1-billion-to.html?page=all">$1 billion investment</a>.<br />
 <br />
The challenges GE faced were daunting. If the goal was to leapfrog the competition in every product line while revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, management had to take a big swing. The $1 billion plan envisioned 11 new product platforms in six different manufacturing sites. GE needed to reduce new product development cycles from 3-4 years to 1-1.5 years. The plants had been on life support, so they needed major repairs. The workplace was divided into functional areas; no one knew how to work together. All the laboratory equipment had been given away. The only people left were tough survivors, so the bench was not deep. The company needed to rebuild expertise and capabilities. It needed to recruit huge numbers of people in a short period of time. It needed to invest in new development labs and to co-locate teams.<br />
 <br />
In the summer of 2009 management decided to bring production of a water heater back to the U.S. from an Asian contractor. GE manufacturing leaders started applying <a href="http://www.ge.com/audio_video/ge/innovation/lean_manufacturing_ge_appliance_park_louisville_kentucky.html">"Lean" thinking and tools</a> to a "model line" for manufacturing in Appliance Park. They introduced a new cross-functional team structure for improvement &#8212; the "Big Room." Functions were seated together with a common goal: working on the value stream from consumer research to testing. They put the schedule up on the wall so everybody knew what was happening. There was a fishbone diagram of the production flow (the backbone was the main flow, and the branches were the sub-assemblies), and a cardboard mockup of the factory layout which also showed how the equipment would look. At 7:45 a.m. each day leaders met, then at 8:00 a.m. everyone met to review the prior day, and what they would do that day. Then at 4:15 p.m. everyone met again to review what they'd done. The water heater that resulted was a new design, with better performance: 20% fewer parts and 50% less labor. Inventory was reduced 60%, labor efficiency improved 30%, time-to-produce was reduced 68%, and space required for the line came down by 80%. </p>

<p>The development team was extremely cohesive. But the problem was, the culture needed to change outside the "Big Room" and very few cultural change efforts had been made since 1994. Employees were anxious: the business had been up for sale in 2008 and 2009, and there had been little to no investment in plants or training. The purpose of their work was being redefined through continuous improvement, but the clarity across functions and among the workforce was fuzzy. </p>

<p><strong>As the leadership began to introduce a new way of working together it had to solidify trust in the workforce and instill a level of confidence that continuous improvement was not just another initiative that would pass. This would be a journey.</strong> </p>

<p>To spread the new culture more broadly, management decided to form another cross-functional team (a "Little Big Room") to define tenets about how they would operate. A team of 16 curious, honest, and bold people &#8212; including production operators and leaders from HR, engineering, purchasing, operations, and training &#8212; were selected. Everyone who joined the team had to leave his or her job for four months. They visited the furniture manufacturer Herman Miller and auto supplier <a href="http://www.autoliv.com/Pages/default.aspx">Autoliv </a>to see what mature Lean operations looked like. They saw hourly workers deeply engaged in reviews of operational performance measures, solving complex problems. The GE team developed a purpose and nine guiding principles &#8212; the "Appliances Performance System." The biggest shift was to focus on making work better for front line operators and put everyone else in support of operators...shifting the paradigm to <em>support </em>versus command and control.<br />
 <br />
To further shift the culture, Dirk Bowman made a commitment that nobody would lose his or her job due to Lean, but that everybody's job would change every day. The union president echoed the same message. The union acted as a second set of leaders to help execute and reinforce changes. To demonstrate their deep commitment, in December 2011 GE rolled out team leader training. GE Appliances now has a dedicated <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/video/2008/12/the-importance-of-learning-in.html">learning organization</a> that in 2012 trained 3,000 employees on the fundamentals of the Appliances Performance System.<br />
 <br />
So, while the macro story may be about jobs coming back "onshore," at its core this is really a process and a culture story. GE Appliances is proving once again that the balance of process and people, aligned with a clearly articulated and understood purpose and vision, is the source of improved performance and capability development. With leadership engagement and support, this system will thrive.<br />

      <p>Even a brief interaction can change the way people think about themselves, their leaders, and the future. Each of those many connections you make has the potential to become a high point or a low point in someone's day. Each is a chance to transform an ordinary moment into a touchpoint. </p>

<p>What is a touchpoint? A touchpoint is an interaction with one other person, a couple of people, or a group that can last a couple of minutes, a couple of hours, or a couple of days. Those Touchpoints can be planned or spontaneous, casual or carefully choreographed.   </p>

<p>Every touchpoint is spring-loaded with possibilities. Each one can build &#8212; or break &#8212; a relationship. </p>

<p>For instance, when I was a first year graduate student at the J. L. Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University taking a Management Policy class. My professor, Ram Charan, noticed that my schoolwork was starting to slip. I was not only taking a full load of classes but I was also working two jobs. I was stretched pretty thin. One day, Ram called me aside and said, <strong>"You can do better."</strong> Those four words inspired me to hold myself to a higher standard. I remember those words as if they were spoken yesterday and that was over 35 years ago. </p>

<p>Shortly after I graduated, I accepted a job with General Mills. Like many people starting a new job in a new place, I was completely lost in the building. This older man saw me stumbling around and said, "Young man... you look lost. How can I help?" I asked him if he could help me find my way back to the marketing department.  He pointed the way and said, "So you work in the marketing department. If there is one thing that I want to leave you with is that you've got to <strong>give it all you've got</strong>." We then went our separate ways. Ultimately, I saw this man's picture a couple of weeks later and discovered that he was Jim McFarland, the CEO and Chairman of General Mills. Those five words inspired me to lean into my work with greater intensity. I carry them with me today. </p>

<p>I had been with General Mills for six months and I was up for my first performance review. I was struggling to hit the ground running. I had never worked in an office environment before in my life. Here I was, unmistakably a rookie. During the performance review, my manager offered this observation, "Doug, you are clearly very determined to contribute here but, quite frankly, your work is very mediocre." That comment, in and of itself, was something I was able work through. Next, I was to receive feedback from my boss's boss. In this case, he had written six words down on a piece of paper to be read to me. Those words were, <strong>"You should look for another job."</strong> This was the first performance review I had received in my life and my boss's boss, whom I thought was a god, just told me to go look for another job. He wasn't inclined to give me the time of the day or the benefit of the doubt. I was devastated and very anxious but ultimately I played through it. Those six words reminded me that the corporate journey is not for the faint of heart. You must bring great resolve to your work. It's not all a bed of roses. </p>

<p>I persevered through some difficult times as I was starting up my career and I was promoted to Product Manager at General Mills in a very timely way. Within 48 hours of that promotion, I received a call from my wife's grandfather, Mr. R. T. Johnstone. R.T., a man I admired greatly, said, <strong>"I'm so proud of you."</strong> Those five words of encouragement reminded me that I was not alone on this journey, as difficult as it was. My family was, is and will always be with me. Those words ring in my ears to this day.</p>

<p>After six years of working in the General Mills food group, I transferred over to the General Mills toy group. Three years in, I lost my job. I've shared this experience <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/03/what_losing_my_job_taught_me_a.html">in great detail here before</a>. After I was let go from General Mills, I went to an outplacement counselor; a man by the name of Neil MacKenna. Every time Neil would answer the phone he would say, "Hello, this is Neil MacKenna, how can I help?" With those four words, <strong>"How can I help?"</strong> Neil changed my entire work life. He helped me see beyond my own agenda to discover the fulfillment of starting every interaction with a desire to be helpful. This was a very powerful lesson, delivered in four words. It took all of two seconds. </p>

<p>On July 2, 2009, I was involved in a very serious automobile accident. I was traveling to my home in Northern New Jersey for the Fourth of July weekend. I was in the back of a Lincoln Navigator asleep with my seat belt on when, while going at least 70 miles an hour, we ran into the back of a stopped dump truck on the New Jersey Turnpike. It was a very serious accident. I was taken to a nearby trauma center and went through an extensive array of surgical procedures. Understandably, I was pretty much out of it for 24 hours. When I woke up in the intensive care unit my wife, Leigh, who had been helping my daughter move into her apartment in Washington D.C., was right by my side. And all she said were three words. She said, <strong>"I'm right here."</strong> Those three words, said in one second, connected me in a powerfully indescribable way with my wife and my recovery. I'll never forget the moment.</p>

<p>Over the following 40 days, as I was recovering from the automobile accident, I had been moved from the ICU to the trauma center then to a hospital and finally to a rehabilitation program. I dealt with nurses in all four of these facilities that, time and again, reaffirmed for me the power of touchpoints &#8212; that they're not just about the words you say, they're about how you say them. </p>

<p>There was the same protocol over all four facilities. In this case, every nurse would come into my room and ask me the same question: "How is your pain?" When the nurses were fully prepared and exceptionally gifted at managing patients they could come into the room and dial-in in a very thoughtful and genuine way. But with nurses who were new to the profession, new to the facility, or who just felt a little bit uncomfortable getting into a conversation, I would quickly realize that those four words weren't about me; it was about how they were going to handle me. It was about them. Those conversations were always awkward.</p>

<p>So, those four words, <strong>"How is your pain?"</strong> opened up a world that was magical when it was well managed. But when not well managed, the resulting awkwardness could completely undermine the effectiveness of the nurse. Those four words reaffirmed the power of touchpoints. </p>

<p>There you have it:<br />
<ul><br />
	<li>Seven memorable touchpoints</li><br />
	<li>32 words total</li><br />
	<li>Less than five words per Touchpoint</li><br />
	<li>Strung together, it's generously 20 seconds of conversation</li><br />
	<li>That's approximately four seconds per touchpoint</li><br />
</ul></p>

<p>Despite their brevity, those seven touchpoints have had a profound impact on my life. I encourage each of you to look for opportunities to have a profound impact on the next touchpoint you encounter. You have the opportunity to make a tremendous impact on the lives of the people with whom you work and live. Make the most of it. The next touchpoint is right around the corner &#8212; use it wisely.</p>

            Working From My Bean Bag Chair Treadmill Desk<br />
            
            That's what everyone's favorite late CEO did when he designed Pixar's offices in 1986. Instead of putting the bathrooms (and café and mailboxes and gift shop) off to the side, Steve Jobs placed them in an atrium at the center of the workspace. And "although some were more than a little annoyed to have to traipse to the lobby every time they needed the loo &#8212; something remarkable started to happen," writes <em>The Independent's</em> Archie Bland. "Pixar’s employees started to bump into each other. They shot the breeze. Sometimes, the chatter would yield something useful, and one of the participants would head back to her desk with a new idea." And now everyone wants to be like Apple. Bland ventures into the West London headquarters of juice and smoothie maker Innocent to witness  "a benevolent, juice-obsessed cult, teetering on the border between charming and insufferable; that is, like an Innocent smoothie bottle with desks in it." While perhaps an extreme example, this type of setup is prized by the likes of Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer, who says that people are "more collaborative and innovative when they’re together. Some of the best ideas come from putting two different ideas together." And recent research found that people are happier when they have different options for where and how to work. But does that actually lead to productivity &#8212; and, perhaps most important, to profit? Maybe not. Dish Network is often cited as <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-02/dish-network-the-meanest-company-in-america">one of the most hostile workplaces in America</a> and still boasts outstanding numbers. So goes this winding article, with no real answers but with lots of important questions that will shape how we work in the future.

			<h4><a href="http://www.inc.com/eric-markowitz/sec-lifts-ban-on-general-solicitation.html" class="titlelink"> Finally: SEC Lifts Ban on Advertising Fundraising Rounds  <em>Inc. </em></a></h4>
          <p class="main">
            Until now, start-ups in the U.S. couldn't advertise themselves as investment opportunities through traditional media to nonaccredited investors. If they wanted to sell stock, they had to do it through official financial channels such as angel investor groups. That made it hard for start-ups to raise money from ordinary investors, and hard for ordinary investors, especially those outside VC hotbeds such as Silicon Valley, to put money into promising new businesses. But the Securities and Exchange Commission, prodded by recent legislation, voted this week to lift its ban on what's known as "general solicitation" of fundraising rounds. Now entrepreneurs will be allowed to solicit investments through new channels, provided they vet investors. The big complaint about the ruling is that it creates new bureaucratic obstacles to selling stock. But the upside is big: Entrepreneurs living outside tech hubs may find it easier to connect with investors and grow their startups without having to relocate, says <em>Inc</em>. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-10/sec-lifts-ban-on-hedge-funds-advertising-dot-hilarity-ensues">Cue the Twitter jokes</a>. <em>&#8212; Andy O'Connell</em>

            <h4><a href="http://www.bus.umich.edu/NewsRoom/ArticleDisplay.asp?news_id=25837" class="titlelink">Strategic Controversy: Welcome the Dissent  <em>University of Michigan Ross School of Business</em></a></h4>
          <p class="main">
            Why is it that when you attend a strategy meeting, everyone who isn’t nodding off to sleep seems be nodding in agreement, at least on the basics? It's not because everyone really <em>does</em> agree; it's because companies don't know how to handle reasoned disagreement, says Aneel Karnani of the University of Michigan. It's rare for companies to value internal debate. One positive example he cites is a company that typically identifies five pressing issues and assigns two managers to each, telling them to explore different avenues. In the end, one approach is chosen for each problem. The key to opening the floor to dissent is to depersonalize the discussion. Argue about ideas, not people. That way you get robust, constructive debate that can help your company choose the right strategy. "The 'Let's all be team players' and 'Let's pull together' thinking can be a trap," Karnani says. "Strategy comes from internal debate, even dissent." I don't disagree. <em>&#8212; Andy O'Connell</em>

            Imagine, for a moment, the CEO of a major company sitting alone in his South Florida mansion. You run a division of his company and can only see him via video conference. Your job is to convince him to give you money to fund your retail operation, and not others in the company. He barely pays attention, until he disagrees with what you’re saying. Then he berates you for an hour. Now imagine that this is reality at Sears. In this fascinating and slightly hard-to-believe story, Mina Kimes explains why Eddie Lampert runs Sears like a hedge fund, splitting the operation into 30 independent divisions with their own CEOs, CMOs, and boards. Former execs say it's created chaos and infighting. Lampert counters: "Decentralized systems and structures work better than centralized ones because they produce better information over time." Meanwhile, Sears continues to record losses while attempting to reinvent shopping on digital devices. There are also these tidbits: Lampert makes his first CEO entrance at a shareholder meeting to the tune of Maroon 5's "Moves Like Jagger." He created a social network for Sears employees on which he used the pseudonym "Eli Wexler." And he's really into Ayn Rand.

          <p class="main">
            Praising people makes them &#8212;  and you &#8212;  feel good, so why not be liberal about doling out the ego-buffing compliments? Because if you praise people the wrong way, you can prompt them to unconsciously increase what's known as "escalation of commitment" &#8212; the tendency to stick with a course of action even after it's been discredited, writes Wharton professor Adam Grant. In an experiment, when people who had been praised for their decision-making skills made a choice about whether to keep investing in a bad choice (in this case, a bad hire), they were 40% more likely to escalate their commitment to the new employee than people who hadn't been praised. Makes sense: If you've been told you're a great decision maker, you <em>must</em> have made a good decision, so you'd better stick with it. But people who had been praised instead for their creativity were 40% <em>less</em> likely to escalate their commitment than those who hadn't been praised. Since they had been induced to feel good about something other than their decision making, these people were willing to admit to having made poor choices. Any time you give positive feedback for a particular skill or trait, the praisee is at risk for becoming overconfident in that domain. <em>&#8212; Andy O'Connell</em>

      <p>How do you become truly influential? We've found that the most highly respected leaders avoid techniques to gain short-term compliance; they also steer clear of a self-centered "How can I get people to do what I want?" mindset. Instead, they take a different approach altogether. </p>

<p>We interviewed over 100 high-impact influencers from a wide range of industries and organizations for our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Real-Influence-Persuade-Without-Pushing/dp/081442015X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1362197324&sr=8-1&keywords=real+influence">recent book</a>. To achieve real influence, they tend to follow four steps that turn typical persuasion strategies upside down. These steps are action guidelines all of us can use to get things done with people in ways that not only yield great results, but also strengthen relationships and enhance credibility.  </p>

<p>In previous articles we covered <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/02/to_have_real_influence_focus_o.html">Step 1: Go for great outcomes</a>, <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/03/for_real_influence_use_level_f.html">Step 2: Listen past your blind spots</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/04/how_to_really_understand_someo.html">Step 3: Engage others in "their there."</a></p>

<p>In this post we cover Step 4: <em>When you've done enough... do more.</em></p>

<p>Think back to the last time you helped someone very important in your life achieve a goal. Maybe you helped a friend with a business venture, participated in planning a wedding, or pitched in when a son or daughter moved to a new city.</p>

<p>When you offered your help, we bet you didn't say, "I'll take a few minutes to offer some advice, but for more than that you'll have to do something for me." </p>

<p>Instead, you spent hours running errands, hanging decorations, or moving furniture. You volunteered for messy, difficult, or time-consuming chores like cleaning the fridge or carefully writing 300 names on 300 place cards.</p>

<p>Why? Because you automatically do more for the people you care about deeply. In fact, you usually don't even stop to think about it. It comes naturally to you because your relationships with these people matter and you want to strengthen them.</p>

<p>Of course, these relationships are special; they mean more to you than a business connection or a relationship with a casual friend. But in any relationship, you can go beyond what's expected. When you do this, you make a statement about who you are as a person and a professional.</p>

<p>Our friend Kouji Nakata describes it this way: "It's about not being the main attraction. You look for the angle of help; look for the angle of assistance. It's like being a caring relative, like an uncle who really is taking an interest in his nephew. Look for the way that they can shine and help them do it. Don't be the important piece. Step aside, get alongside them, and help them do great things and help them be happy."</p>

<p>When you do this, you set the stage for positive influence both now and in the future. "Overdelivering" makes you stand out in the moment and makes people remember you later. You become locked in as someone who deserves to be listened to, and people don't wonder whether you have ulterior motives or hidden agendas.</p>

<p>Doing more isn't just a onetime thing but an ongoing practice. For maximum effect, you'll want to focus on three distinct times when you can do more: <em>before</em>, <em>during</em>, and <em>after </em>an interaction. </p>

<p>When you begin interactions in this way &#8212; by doing more, and sometimes even taking a risk in the process &#8212; you form instant bonds with people who are tired of being ripped off, manipulated, or given the bare minimum of service. You prove immediately to these people that you have integrity. And they tell other people, who tell still more people. </p>

<p>In fact, you can "do more" for people who have no connection with you at all. Think of this as committing "random acts of doing more."</p>

<p>David Bradford, former CEO of Fusion-IO, fell into a great outcome by doing exactly that. Here's the story behind his break-through addition of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak to Fusion-IO, which helped drive the organization's phenomenal success.</p>

<p>David didn't target "Woz." Instead, one of David's random acts of doing more led to a cascade of positive results.</p>

<p>David, who at the time was living in Utah, had a friend whose son was moving into the state and could use some help setting up his law practice. David obliged, helping get the young man connected and raising his visibility in the state.</p>

<p>A few months later, because of this connection, David received a request to speak at the Utah Bar Association. It was in Sun Valley, a five-hour drive for him, and he'd be speaking to a relatively small group. Many people would have considered it a complete waste of time. But David cheerfully agreed.</p>

<p>After the speech, he stayed for lunch. As it turned out, the keynote speaker was Steve Wozniak. Chance led Wozniak's executive assistant to sit right next to David. She observed that Wozniak would probably enjoy the opportunity to speak with him, joking that he'd welcome "a kindred spirit from the information technology world in a room full of lawyers," and she was right &#8212; they struck up a conversation. </p>

<p>It turned out that Woz had his eye on solid-state trends that Fusion-IO was exploring. Later David sent him materials and asked if he'd like to be a part of the advisory board. Wozniak said yes, and then went on to take the role of chief scientist.</p>

<p>Just random chance? Maybe. But in the bigger picture, the David Bradfords of the world don't think of it as blind chance. They think, "That's how it works." It's about a mindset that starts not with results, but with relationships. You may not have any clue where those relationships will lead . . . but that's part of the excitement of real influence.</p>

<p>When you do more, always remember that you're not "giving to get." Never see your actions as a prelude to springing an uncomfortable request on another person. Instead, understand that your goals are to build long-term relationships and to make things better.</p>

<p>If you've noticed in yourself  a "zero sum" mentality, work to move beyond it. It's holding you back. Instead, think of the times in your own life when people have done more for you. How can you pay forward to others the positive influence these people gave you? How can you do more for people before, during, and after the projects you're currently planning?</p>

<p>When you find ways to help other people learn, grow, gain, avoid problems, make progress, and achieve their goals, you achieve something far more important than near-term gain. You form the basis for ongoing results, enriched relationships, and an integrity-based reputation. </p>

<p>And that will lead &#8212; in wonderful ways you can't even begin to predict right now &#8212; to real, lifelong influence.</p>

      <p>In 1973, Peter Drucker stated in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Management-Responsibilities-Practices-Peter-Drucker/dp/0887306152">Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices,</A> "Management is not culture-free, that is, part of the world of nature. It is a social function. It is, therefore, both socially accountable and culturally embedded." </p>

<p>Some thirteen years later, Tom Peters remarked in the article <a href="http://www.tompeters.com/column/1986/005163.php">Managing As Symbolic Action</a>: "It requires us, as managers, to get people to share our sense of urgency in new priorities; to develop personal, soul-deep animus toward things as they are; to get up the nerve and energy to take on the forces of inertia that bog down any significant change program."</p>

<p>Yet, here we are in 2013 with organizational leadership models that continue to deny the social nature of organizations and wallow in inertia.</p>

<p>Our leadership practices remain authoritative. People are disengaged, distrusting and perhaps even disenfranchised.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.edelman.com/insights/intellectual-property/trust-2013/">2013 Edelman Trust Barometer</a>, fewer than 20% of respondents believe leaders are actually telling the truth when confronted with a difficult issue in their organizations. Furthermore, a study conducted by the Human Capital Institute and Interaction Associates in 2013 found only 34% of organizations had high levels of trust in the places they work. And, a paltry 38% reported that their organizations had effective leadership running the show.</p>

<p>To cap off a small sliver of dismal data points, research firm Gallup found that over a twelve-year period between 2000 and 2012, the percentage of engaged employees in the workforce has shifted between 26% and 30%. That is, roughly 70% of employees in today's organizations have spent more than a decade essentially collecting a pay check, an almost Shakespearean spectacle of tragic ambivalence. </p>

<p>What if our approach to leadership was to evolve into Drucker's vision of "socially accountable and culturally embedded" management? </p>

<p>Cam Crosbie is the CIO of Equitable Life Insurance Company of Canada, represented by more than 10,000 independent producers across Canada and Bermuda. Cam completely understands the need to "lead without authority." He does so, quite simply, by asking questions rather than barking orders. Before moving forward with a big decision or a large project, Cam makes a practice of asking lots of questions, including, as he says, "even the so called 'dumb ones'".  </p>

<p>As a CIO, Cam believes it's important to reach out to others and inquire before pushing ahead. Cam said, "I hope that in some small way if people see the CIO unashamedly asking the simple questions, it clears the way for clearer and more meaningful discussion." Perhaps the first step toward a better future for your organization is to acknowledge that you don't necessarily know the way there &#8212; and, just as important, to understand that by asking questions, you not only awaken and engage people, you stand to collect more valuable perspective and ideas than you would by starting from a position of authority. </p>

<p>Leadership isn't a 9-5 job &#8212; it's communal, it's holistic and it's accretive. It's time to abandon the long-held notion that the "leader" knows all and should decide everything. A fancy title doesn't put you above others &#8212; it puts you in their service.</p>

<p>TELUS, a national telecommunications company in Canada, with $11 billion of annual revenue and more than 40,000 employees worldwide (and where I am head of learning and collaboration), has worked incredibly hard over the past five years to raise employee engagement from 53% to 80%. It did so through myriad actions including the launch of the TELUS Leadership Philosophy. The TLP is an enterprise-wide leadership framework that cultivates a collaborative, social, open and engaging mindset among all employees regardless of rank or title. It encourages all employees to "engage and explore" with one another before "executing." It defines key behavioral attributes such as communicating, collaborating, learning, deciding and adapting such that everyone can speak the same leadership language. </p>

<p>In mid-2010, an internal program was born at TELUS entitled Customers First. The overarching goal of the program was to improve the likelihood that TELUS customers would recommend the company. As the program began to gain traction, another idea surfaced: Customer Commitments. Think of the commitments as customer promises &#8212; specific actions that any TELUS team member would carry out to help a customer regardless of role.</p>

<p>Instead of locking its most senior executives in a room to decide what the Customer Commitments were going to be for the organization, we designed a collaborative process that involved the entire organization. Over 1,000 different examples surfaced over a two-month period. Through focus groups, interactive online polling and voting, the 1,000 were whittled down to a final four. </p>

<p>If the culture at TELUS was one that relied on authoritative leadership, the Customer Commitments would have been created in a couple of hours by a few authoritative leaders. Because the culture was healthy, open and participative as opposed to dogmatic and ruthlessly hierarchical, the organization collaborated without authority. This is the work of leadership today: asking questions, involving people, connecting them to each other, creating a platform for their insights and ideas to make a real impact &#8212; in other words, unleashing leadership behavior everywhere.</p>

<p>In this moment of reflection, as we seek to redefine the work of leadership, let us remember the words of Nelson Mandela:</p>

<blockquote>"[Ubuntu is] the profound sense that we are human only through the humanity of others; that if we are to accomplish anything in this world it will in equal measure be due to the work and achievements of others."</blockquote>

<p>If you're lonely at the top, it's time to start recognizing and amplifying the contribution of those around you. </p>

      <p>If you're a manager working with the analysts in your organization to make more data-driven business decisions, asking good questions should be one of your top priorities. Many managers fear that asking questions will make them appear unintelligent about quantitative matters. However, if you ask the right kinds of questions, you can both appear knowledgeable and advance the likelihood of a good decision outcome.</p>

<p>In my new book (co-authored with Jinho Kim) <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Keeping-Up-Quants-Understanding-Analytics/dp/142218725X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1372686010&sr=1-1&keywords=keeping+up+with+the+quants">Keeping Up with the Quants</a></em>, and in <a href="http://hbr.org/2013/07/keep-up-with-your-quants/ar/1">a related article</a> in this month's HBR, we list a lot of possible questions for various stages of analysis. But in this short article, I thought it might be useful not only to mention a couple of the most important questions you can ask about data, but what some of the ensuing dialogue might involve. </p>

<p><strong>1.Questions about Assumptions</strong></p>

<p><em>You ask:</em> What are the assumptions behind the model you built? </p>

<p><em>You think in response to their answer:</em>  If they say there are no particular assumptions, you should worry &#8212; because every model has assumptions behind it. It may be only that you're assuming that the sample represents a population, or that the data gathered at a previous time are still representative of the current time. </p>

<p><em>Follow-up:</em> Is there any reason to believe that those assumptions are no longer valid?</p>

<p><em>You think in response:</em> You are really looking only for a thoughtful response here. The only way to know for sure about whether assumptions still hold is to do a different analysis on newly-gathered data &#8212; which could be very expensive. Perhaps a particular relationship only holds when the values of a variable are moving in a particular direction (e.g., "this mortgage risk model only holds true when housing prices are going up &#8212; nah, that could never change!").</p>

<p><strong>2. Questions about Data Distribution</strong></p>

<p><em>You ask:</em> How are the data you gathered distributed? </p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/simplescatter.gif"><img alt="Scatterplot" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/simplescatter-thumb-200x231-4369.gif" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></p>

<p><em>You think in response:</em> If the person can't describe the distribution, he or she is a shoddy analyst. Good analysts should have already looked at &#8212; and be able to show you &#8212; a visual display of the distribution of your data on any particular variable.<br />
 <br />
If you are interested in one variable as a likely predictor of another, ask for a "scatterplot" and look to see if the data line up in any linear pattern; that would indicate a strong correlation between the two variables.  </p>

<p><em>Follow-up:</em> Do the data follow a normal distribution? </p>

<p><em>You think in response:</em> If the analyst says that the data aren't distributed normally (i.e., in a bell-shaped curve), then he or she needs to employ different types of statistics (called "<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonparametric-statistics.asp">nonparametric</a>" statistics), and some commonly-used ones like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09kiX3p5Vek">standard deviations</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence">correlations</a> don't apply. </p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/normaldistribution.gif"><img alt="Normal Distribution " src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/normaldistribution-thumb-200x231-4371.gif" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>You might ask how they adjusted their analysis based on the distribution. For example, nonparametric tests often require a larger number of cases for the same level of statistical confidence.</p>

<p><em>Second follow-up:</em> Were there any significant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier">outliers</a>?</p>

<p><em>You think in response:</em> If the data are normally distributed but there are some outliers (unexpected values that don't fit the pattern), you could ask what they might mean, and what the analyst plans to do with them. In some cases it may be reasonable to delete outliers &#8212; if, for example, they are the result of coding errors.</p>

<p>You get the picture. It's important to show with this dialogue that you are interested, somewhat knowledgeable, and dedicated to a good decision outcome. You're not trying to suggest with such questions that you know more than the analyst, or that the analyst is hiding anything from you. It's the same sort of conversation that a CEO might have with a division manager who is presenting financial results. Gentle probing is the desirable tone.</p>

      <p>Undergraduates who had gazed at their 40-year-old selves in virtual "mirrors" were <strong>74% less</strong> likely to cheat for extra cash on a subsequent trivia test, says a team led by Jean-Louis van Gelder of the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement and Hal E. Hershfield of NYU. This and another experiment suggest that one reason people make self-defeating choices such as engaging in unethical behavior is that their ability to imagine their future selves is limited. They're less inclined to indulge in illegal acts if they can see vivid images of themselves such as the computer simulations presented by the researchers. See Hershfield's "Defend Your Research" <a href="http://hbr.org/2013/06/you-make-better-decisions-if-you-see-your-senior-self/ar/1">interview </a>in the June 2013 HBR.</p>

      <p>The prospects for investors, be they corporate pensions, sovereign wealth funds, or individuals, appear bleak. John Authers, <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/efa26a96-e98f-11e2-bf03-00144feabdc0.html">in Thursday's <em>FT</em></a>, musters up the evidence (or at least the opinions) that bonds and stocks are both likely to deliver paltry returns for years to come. Sheelah Kolhatkar, in a <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-11/why-hedge-funds-glory-days-may-be-gone-for-good">cover story</a> (and what a <em>classy</em> cover it is) in the new <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>, argues that the great alternative to plain-vanilla equity and debt investing &#8212; the hedge fund &#8212; is more or less over, too. And London Business School's Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton, in a Credit Suisse report cited by Authers that's a few months old but it is <a href="http://www.investmenteurope.net/digital_assets/6305/2013_yearbook_final_web.pdf">well worth downloading and taking the time to read</a>, make a pretty convincing case that the equity and bond returns that came to be perceived in the U.S. as "normal" in the decades following World War II &#8212; and particularly since 1980 &#8212; are anything but.</p>

<p>We're all pretty well aware of the negative consequences of low investment returns, although perhaps not of the specifics. Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton calculate that a 25-year-old entering a defined-contribution retirement savings plan &#8212; such as a 401(k) in the U.S. &#8212; needs to set aside 16% to 20% of her income <em>(!)</em> if she hopes to retire at age 65 at half salary.</p>

<p>Still, where there are losers, there are winners. "While a low-return world imposes stresses on investors and savers in an over-leveraged world recovering from a deep financial crisis," Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton write, "it provides essential relief for borrowers." The biggest borrowers these days are governments, and because governments possess powers that most borrowers don't, they are often able to cut their borrowing costs at the expense of creditors through a variety of techniques that Harvard economist Carmen Reinhart dubs "<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-11/financial-repression-has-come-back-to-stay-carmen-m-reinhart.html">financial repression</a>."</p>

<p>Financial repression doesn't sound like a good thing, and in some ways it isn't. But the great global recovery after World War II was accomplished in an environment of artificially low interest rates and capital controls &#8212; that is, financial repression. So it doesn't have to be bad economic news. Sometimes governments actually use the money they borrow wisely.</p>

<p>Then there are the other tradeoffs inherent in investment returns. Over time, Rob Arnott and Peter Bernstein demonstrated in a <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/abs/10.2469/faj.v58.n2.2524">great 2002 article in the <em>Financial Analysts Journal</em></a>, stock market returns should and do trail economic growth. That's because:<br />
<blockquote>Shareholders can expect to participate <em>only in the growth of the enterprises they are investing in</em>. An important engine for economic growth is the creation of new enterprises. The investor in today's enterprises does not own tomorrow's new enterprises &#8212; not without making a separate investment in those new enterprises with new investment capital.</blockquote></p>

<p>So when U.S. stock market returns outpace economic growth, that money has to come from somewhere. It can be taken out of workers' paychecks, creditors' pockets, or government coffers. It can come from overseas, as U.S.-based companies take advantage of faster growth elsewhere. And it can come from the future, as investors bet on faster growth to come.</p>

<p>During the great bull market of 1981 to 2001, all of these factors played a role. I'll focus on workers' paychecks. Labor's share of income actually didn't drop all that much over those two decades &#8212; in part because of big increases in worker pay (including a lot of stock-option jackpots) in the final years of the 1990s boom. But <a href="http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/commentary/2012/2012-13.cfm">the longer-term trend since the 1960s has been of a significant decline in the percentage of total income going to workers</a>, one that has accelerated over the past decade &#8212; during which stocks have sputtered but bond investors have done quite well.</p>

<p>So here's the big if. If those low investment returns that everybody's projecting are low just because the global economy keeps sputtering, that's not good news for anybody. If, however, they signal a regime change in which the financial sector's great rise over the past few decades begins to reverse and other sectors &#8212; governments and workers mainly, although there are certainly business sectors that have lagged as well &#8212; grab a greater share of economic growth, that doesn't have to be a bad thing at all.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, I'll admit, this amounts to saying that if times are bad they'll be bad, and if they're good they'll be good. But it's important to draw the link between two important and seldom-connected discussions: one about the prospects for investment returns, the other about <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/time-to-bypass-modern-finance-by-j--bradford-delong">the proper role of finance and capital in the economy</a>. Because if the financial sector shrinks in relative size, and working stiffs gain a greater share of national income &#8212; both of which would be healthy developments, I think &#8212; the share of economic growth going to investors will have to decline.</p>

      <p>Understanding the implementation plans for the health care law passed in 2010 is a complicated job for even the most seasoned policy wonks. A cascading series of deadlines, operating systems, and reporting rules have to be arranged, tested, and communicated. Add to this the resounding refrain that <a href="http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/30/17988277-poll-many-americans-uninformed-about-health-care-overhaul-some-dont-know-its-law?lite">many Americans</a>  &#8212; and perhaps even <a href="http://www.theihcc.com/en/communities/policy_legislation/industry-survey-confusion-and-inactivity-widesprea_hdc2shs8.html">many employers</a> &#8212; don't fully understand what compliance with the landmark law will mean.</p>

<p>These logistics took a sharp new turn last week when the Obama administration decided to <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/putting-off-the-employer-mandate/">delay</a> enforcing mandatory employer and insurer employment requirements until 2015. This provision would have required most companies with the equivalent of 50 or more full-time workers to offer health benefits on January 1, 2014, or pay a fine of at least $2,000 per employee. (Click <a href="http://kff.org/infographic/employer-responsibility-under-the-affordable-care-act/">here for a chart</a> that breaks out the employer responsibilities around the Affordable Care Act). The delay has spurred <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/july-dec13/healthcare_07-03.html">fresh debates</a> about the law and its oversight. It has also led GOP leaders to start advocating anew <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/07/10/200842381/gop-says-why-not-delay-that-health-care-law-like-forever">for rollbacks or delays</a> on other key provisions, like the individual mandate. The House could call as many as <a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Multimedia/2013/July/071013-health-on-the-hill-employer-mandate-delay.aspx">three votes</a> on the ACA in July. </p>

<p>The Treasury Department blog post <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Continuing-to-Implement-the-ACA-in-a-Careful-Thoughtful-Manner-.aspx">announcing the change</a> cast the move as careful implementation of the law that recognized "concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively."</p>

<p>There's a key word: time. </p>

<p>Most large U.S. companies <a href="http://kff.org/health-costs/report/employer-health-benefits-2012-annual-survey/">already provide workers</a> with health benefits. But some of the businesses that would have been impacted by the employer mandate &#8212;  in sectors like <a href="http://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=News&op=viewlive&sp_id=1616">retail</a> and <a href="http://www.restaurant.org/Pressroom/Press-Releases/National-Restaurant-Association-Commends-Administr">food service</a> &#8212; didn't appear <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/us/at-restaurant-delay-is-help-on-health-law.html?hp">to be ready</a> to comply with the law. The administration also needs time to work on the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/delay-obamacare-requirement-puts-onus-honor-system-053417869.html">reporting requirements</a> that will be part and parcel of making the system work. </p>

<p>So the law has hit a delay, political heat is rising, businesses are in the middle, and many people are still just plain confused about what they have to do. </p>

<p>The tumult puts the broader role of the <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/22/is-employer-based-health-insurance-worth-saving/">employer as conduit to health care benefits</a> into new context &#8212; and by most accounts in the midst of a sea change. Companies are reexamining their place in the health care chain and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/24/everything-you-know-about-employers-and-obamacare-is-wrong/">what that means</a> both for their workers and their tax strategies. One trend worth noting is toward <a href="http://www.rwjf.org/en/research-publications/find-rwjf-research/2012/10/consumer-directed-health-plans.html">consumer-directed health plans</a>, which put workers in control of spending and coverage decisions.</p>

<p>"If fifteen years ago we were to have a discussion of health care in one of our membership meetings, 100% of the people attending the meeting would say it's our duty and responsibility to provide health care to our employees," says Jeffrey McGuiness, CEO of the Washington-based HR Policy Association, which represents chief human resource officers from large companies. "Now, my sense is that a very large percentage of those same companies are saying, is that case any longer? Can we really do that in this environment?"</p>

<p>What happens next? Here are a few things to watch:</p>

<p><strong>HR departments.</strong> Companies of all sizes are evaluating their health care strategies and objectives now. HR executives are finding health care planning to be as high on their list of priorities as talent management. But while businesses need to <a href="http://www.hrpolicy.org/position_issue_newsstory.aspx?rid=3402">start strategizing</a>, policy experts like McGuiness caution against making any long-term commitments until the road ahead for the law is clearer. </p>

<p><strong>The definitions of full-time and part-time workers</strong>. The health care law defines a <a href="http://www.adp.com/tools-and-resources/adp-research-institute/insights/~/media/696C3879BDB14C56A98BE58C1F85E363.ashx">full-time employee</a> as one who works an average of 30 hours a week. There are <a href="http://www.nahc.org/assets/1/7/nr130621CollinsDonnelly.pdf">bipartisan bills afoot</a> in Congress that seek to redefine a full-time worker as someone who works 40 hours, not 30. It's tough to say if these will go anywhere. But expect the issue of <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/02/business/la-fi-part-time-healthcare-20130502">who is and isn't a full-time worker</a> to keep coming up in the conversation.</p>

<p><strong>What happens on October 1</strong>. That's when federal and state-run <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/marketplace/individual">healthcare exchanges</a>, where individuals and small businesses can shop for coverage, <a href="http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/health-insurance-exchanges/">are due to be open for enrollment</a>. It's a critical day for the government on the path to making the law a reality. If this <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324520904578553871314315986.html">deadline isn't met</a>, the January, 2014, deadline for the <a href="http://kff.org/infographic/the-requirement-to-buy-coverage-under-the-affordable-care-act/">individual mandate</a> could get thrown into question. Uninsured young people are expected to be among the first to <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/07/09/200066175/baseball-obamacare-fenway-park">get the pitch to sign up</a> (although they apparently won't be <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/sports/2013/07/09/2269311/nfl-obamacare-players-benefit/?mobile=nc">spiking any footballs</a>  to celebrate).</p>

<p><strong>Growth in the U.S. health care sector</strong>. You can slice the news about growth in the health care sector many different ways. First, there is the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/07/a-truly-astonishing-graph-of-the-growth-of-health-care-jobs-in-america/277454/ i">eye-popping growth in jobs</a> in the health care field, which defies <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/fox/2013/07/one-difference-between-a-great.html">most other charts</a> you've seen lately on labor. Second, there are the long-running concerns about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/health/colonoscopies-explain-why-us-leads-the-world-in-health-expenditures.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&">high costs of health care</a> in the U.S., something reform advocates have long hoped to see better calibrated. If we are on the verge of changes in the health care sector, these indicators may help track them.</p>

<p>There are many resources available to help <a href="http://kff.org/interactive/implementation-timeline/">keep up with or understand the law</a>, some with particular value to <a href="http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/browse/Benefits%20Healthcare.jhtml">HR leaders</a>, or <a href="http://readlists.com/3ebe744c/">reporters</a>, or <a href="http://healthlawguide.aarp.org/">consumers</a>. If you have a useful one to recommend for managers, please leave it in the comments.</p>

      <p>The term "data driven" is penetrating the lexicon ever more deeply these days.  Data Driven was the title of <a href="http://hbr.org/product/data-driven-profiting-from-your-most-important-bus/an/1912-HBK-ENG">my latest book</a>, and recent academic work shows that companies that regard themselves as "data driven," are <a href="http://hbr.org/2012/10/big-data-the-management-revolution/ar/1">measurably more profitable</a> than those that aren't.  So becoming data-driven is clearly a worthwhile endeavor.  Yet for all the attention, I've yet to see any clear criteria by which leaders can benchmark themselves and their organizations to figure out what they need to do better. </p>

<p>In my view, the essence of "data-driven" is making better decisions up and down the organization chart.  Over the years I've had the good fortune to work with plenty of individual decision-makers and groups, some terrific and some simply awful.  From that work, I've distilled twelve "traits of the data-driven."  (It bears mention that the data-driven also avoid some self-destructive traits; I'll take these up in another post.)</p>

<p><strong>Traits of the Data-Driven</strong></p>

<p>The data-driven:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Make decisions at the lowest possible level</li>
	<li>Bring as much diverse data to any situation as they possibly can.</li>
	<li>Use data to develop a deeper understanding of their worlds.</li>
	<li>Develop an appreciation for variation</li>
	<li>Deal reasonably well with uncertainty</li>
	<li>Integrate their ability to understand data and its implications and their intuitions.</li>
	<li>Recognize the importance of high-quality data and invest to improve.</li>
	<li>Are good experimenters and researchers.</li>
	<li>Recognize that decision criteria can vary with circumstances.</li>
	<li>Recognize that making a decision is only step one.</li>
	<li>Work hard to learn new skills and bring new data and new data technologies (big data, predictive analytics, metadata management, etc) into their organizations.</li>
	<li>Learn from their mistakes.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these traits are important.  And most are self-evident. Only a few require further explanation.  First, data-driven companies work to drive decision-making to the lowest possible level.  One executive I spoke to described how he thought about it this way: "My goal is to make six decisions a year.  Of course that means I have to pick the six most important things to decide on and that I make sure those who report to me have the data, and the confidence, they need to make the others." Pushing decision-making down frees up senior time for the most important decisions.  And, just as importantly, lower-level people spend more time and take greater care when a decision falls to them.  It builds the right kinds of organizational capability and, quite frankly, appears to create a work environment that is more fun.</p>

<p>Second, the data-driven have an innate sense that variation dominates.  Even the simplest process, human response, or most-controlled situation varies.  While they may not use control charts, they know that they have to understand that variation if they are going to understand what is going on.  One middle manager expressed it to me this way, "When I took my first management job, I agonized over results every week.  Some weeks we were up slightly, others down.  I tried to take credit for small upturns and agonized over downturns.  My boss kept telling me to stop &#8212; I was almost certainly making matters worse.  It took a long time for me to learn that things bounce around.  But finally I did."</p>

<p>Third, the data-driven place high demands on their data and data sources.  They know that their decisions are no better than the data on which they are based, so they <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/03/demand_the_right_right_data.html">invest in quality data and cultivate data sources they can trust</a>.  As a result, when a time-sensitive issue comes up they are prepared.  High-quality data makes it easier to understand variation and reduces uncertainty.  Success is measured in execution, and high-quality data makes it easier for others to follow the decision-makers logic and align to the decision.<br />
  <br />
Further, as one executes, one acquires more data.  So the data-driven are constantly re-evaluating, refining their decisions along the way.  They are quicker than others to pull to plug as when the evidence suggests that a decision is wrong.  To be clear, it doesn't appear that the data-driven "turn on a dime"; they know that is not sustainable.  Rather, they learn as they go. </p>

<p>Now take that hard look in the mirror. Look at the list above and give yourself a point for every trait you follow regularly and half a point for those you follow most &#8212; but not all &#8212; of the time. Be hard on yourself. If you can only cite an instance or two, don't give yourself any credit.  </p>

<p>Unless you're one of the rare few that truly score seven or more, you need to improve.  While each person and organization is different, I'd first recommend starting by pushing decision-making down the organization.  I've already noted the benefits.  It may be tough and counterintuitive, especially for managers that want to feel in control, but it's worth the effort.</p>

<p>Second, <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/11/manage_data_with_organizationa.html">invest in quality data</a>.  Frankly, you simply cannot be data-driven (or do anything consistently well for that matter) without high-level of trust in your data and data sources.  You're reduced to your intuition alone, the antithesis of the goal here.  Quality data is a necessity.</p>

<p>Now, take one more step.  You've taken a hard look at yourself.  Engage your management team in doing exactly the same thing for your organization.</p>

      <p>In December, 2001, just prior to filing for bankruptcy, Enron Corporation had approximately $2 billion in cash and no debt coming due.  Despite its infamous financial chicanery, it still appeared to be a viable, profitable firm.  So why did Enron go bankrupt?  Was it because of the fraud, or was there another reason?  </p>

<p>At the <a href="http://www.fraudconference.com/">annual conference of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners</a> late last month, former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who served six years in prison for his part in Enron's deceptions, offered an explanation. In a <a href="http://www.fraudconferencenews.com/home/2013/7/1/keynote-speaker-andrew-fastow">keynote speech</a>, he said Enron went bankrupt because of  <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100847519">"decisions" made in October 2001</a>. He didn't say <em>which</em> decisions. But after hearing Fastow <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/05/if_the_auditors_sign_off_on_it.html">speak twice to my Financial Statement Accounting class</a> and reviewing independent evidence, I think I have good idea. It appears that Enron's final fatal mistake was to try to support its stock price instead of living up to key contractual obligations required to maintain its credit rating.   </p>

<p>Enron owned the largest natural gas pipeline system in the U.S., was the largest trader of natural gas and electricity, owned the largest wind power company, and owned a large electric utility in the Northwest.  These divisions all generated consistent earnings and cash flows. Enron also owned two "prospective" businesses:  Enron Broadband (the first company to offer live video streaming and one that was establishing the largest "cloud storage" system at the time) and Energy Services (providing services to help other companies make their facilities more energy efficient) that weren't producing earnings but weren't a significant drain on the company in late 2001 and, at least with hindsight, represented significant opportunities. The company also had three divisions &#8212; Water, International, and Merchant Investment &#8212; that were saddled with underperforming and over-valued assets.  </p>

<p><strong>What caused Enron to go bankrupt?</strong></p>

<p>What caused Enron's bankruptcy was, quite simply, the loss of its investment-grade credit rating.  Without investment-grade status, counter-parties in its trading business (its largest and most profitable segment) either refused to trade with Enron or demanded collateral (which Enron could not post).  The loss of the investment-grade designation also accelerated other debt maturities.</p>

<p>So, what caused Enron to lose its investment grade rating?  Were the problems at International, Water, and Merchant Investment too big to overcome?  No.  Were the rating agencies aware of Enron's oft-maligned financing structures?  Yes.  Did the rating agencies understand that the acceleration of debt maturities brought on by a downgrade could cause a bankruptcy?  Yes.  </p>

<p>Enron was rated BBB+ (or the equivalent) by all three rating agencies, which typically include all off balance sheet debt when determining a rating. Enron had created multiple non-consolidated Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) that were levered 97/3, meaning $97 of debt to each $3 of equity. Enron's court-appointed bankruptcy examiner estimated the SPEs comprised $14 billion of off-balance sheet debt.  Adding the SPEs to Enron's balance sheet would cause Enron to lose its investment-grade rating.  </p>

<p>Enron's solution was to alter the nature of its SPEs. A typical SPE requires a company to make cash payments to the SPE if its assets fall in value. Enron created Contingent Equity Vehicles (CEVs) wherein Enron pledged to issue new equity, rather than cash, in the event of asset impairment. By way of illustration: including the CEVs on the balance sheet adds $14 billion to assets and $14 billion to liabilities. In the worst-case scenario of a 100% impairment of the CEVs' assets, Enron's assets and equity (retained earnings) would then fall by $14 billion.  However, Enron then could essentially convert the $14 billion CEV debt into equity by issuing new shares. The net result is a drop in assets and debt (equity falls with the decline in assets but goes back up with the issue of new equity) to Enron's exact balance sheet position without the CEVs.  This is why the rating agencies could exclude the SPE debt.</p>

<p>The key feature of these CEVs is that they required Enron to issue the new equity, and they required the lenders and other counterparties to accept new equity in lieu of cash. Firms are often unable to issue new equity at just the moment they need it most, but here Enron could.  In essence, these financing structures were a "fail safe" designed to ensure that Enron's balance sheet remained investment grade.  </p>

<p><strong>Enron's unpleasant choice</strong></p>

<p>As the value of the assets in the SPEs became impaired, Enron faced an unpleasant choice:  issue new equity as promised, thereby diluting current shareholders and causing a drop in stock price, or risk a loss of Enron's investment-grade rating and potentially destroy the firm.  </p>

<p>Enron's CEO at the time, Ken Lay, decided against issuing the stock (and against living up to the financial structure created by Fastow), apparently believing that (a) dilution would cause an even greater loss of confidence than would the impairment of Enron's balance sheet from including the SPEs and (b) the rating agencies would back down.  Instead, the rating agencies downgraded Enron, the trading operations were forced out of business, $4 billion of debt was accelerated, and Enron was forced to file for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The stability of share price is a metric many managers and investors look at when evaluating the "quality" of a firm.  However, in situations where a firm must maintain access to capital markets (e.g. a rapidly growing firm) or must maintain an investment-grade rating for contractual or business purposes (e.g. a financial firm), trying to manage a firm's stock price is clearly secondary to maintaining its credit rating (i.e. it is imperative to maintain the trust of the rating agencies).  The financing structures built to protect Enron in just such an event were unwound.  Ironically, the company's bankruptcy might have been avoided had Enron lived up to the promises in those oft-maligned financing structures.</p>

      <p>Any promising new initiative &#8212; a stand-alone business venture or an innovation in an established organization &#8212;<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/kanter/2012/10/12-guidelines-for-deciding-whe.html"> hits roadblocks and unexpected obstacles</a>. Recently I've advised entrepreneurs and innovators about a different, seemingly better, dilemma: pop-up opportunities that look like short cuts to success. Too often, these turn out to be deadly temptations.</p>

<p>Consider these cases (with names disguised to protect confidentiality):</p>

<p>Bill's venture capital-backed business concept was to operate a new revenue-producing service for large U.S. professional organizations. In its first year, the venture landed two almost-committed pilot sites and a prospect pipeline for a multi-billion-dollar market. But almost at the same time, Bill was offered a lucrative deal to build a similar service for an English-speaking country outside the U.S. Feeling that the money was good and the chance to show credibility to U.S. customers even better, Bill took the deal, brushing aside numerous challenging differences and departures from his model. Then he was offered an even bigger international site in a developing country eager for American know-how, in partnership with a U.S. organization that could also be a customer. His financial backers urged him to take it &#8212; it would mean more revenue, fast. Suddenly Bill was in a different, less appealing business, jeopardizing building the U.S. business.</p>

<p>In this story, that giant sucking sound you hear is the draining of time and energy from the core business by tempting almost-related opportunities. The danger comes from possibilities that are close enough to be plausible but take attention away from the building the main business and don't prove the concept anyway. </p>

<p>Mary's temptations were slightly different but had similar consequences. She started a non-profit organization with lavish foundation funding and a high-profile board in order to spread an innovation in health care. This was a situation devoutly to be wished for by most social causes, but it proved limiting and almost fatal to Mary's project. The staff proliferated without clarity of purpose, and the organization became insular, looking inward and feeling they must be at the top of their field. Other groups courted the organization because it could bring funding, not because of a commitment to the innovation. Soon the goal became how to raise money, not how to support and improve the innovation. The organization took some government contracts to provide a somewhat-related but more routine service. Donors became confused about what the organization did. Private funding declined. The venture was in peril.</p>

<p>Ironically, these problems come along with looking like you might succeed. Investors, donors, potential partners, or bosses shower temptations on entrepreneurs who show promise. Joe's first wildly successful conference, accompanied by highly creative marketing, drew offers to him from investors who wanted to back him to go national, people who wanted to hire him to popularize their work, and companies that wanted him to be a distributor for merchandise sales. Joe was dazzled by the big-name people interested in him. But none of this built Joe's brand. The graveyard of startups is filled with innovators lured by glamour to let others take over their concept before it was fully developed.</p>

<p>In the western classic <em>The Odyssey</em>, Odysseus put wax in his sailors' ears and tied himself to his boat to avoid being tempted by the sirens and lured into lethal rocks. In her new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/1422142698"><em>Sidetracked</em></a>, my HBS colleague Francesa Gino outlines ways to handle more contemporary distractions. Entrepreneurs who want to avoid the deadly temptations I identify here can take these actions:</p>

<p><strong>Establish principles by which opportunities will be judged.</strong> Creating new initiatives benefits from <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/kanter/2010/10/adopt-a-cow-strategy-as-improv.html">the flexibility to</a> <a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/strategy-as-improvisational-theater/">improvise</a>, as I've written, but boundaries and direction ensure that efforts add up in a coherent way and can be replicated and scaled. <a href="http://hbr.org/1996/11/what-is-strategy">Strategy is what you <em>don't </em>do, not just what you do</a>, as my HBS colleague Michael Porter has said.</p>

<p><strong>Prove the concept you want to prove.</strong>  Most people are concrete thinkers who will assume that a project is whatever they first see &#8212; why Bill's strategy for a prototype was very risky. It's important to build into the first model at least one glimmer of everything you anticipate for the full product, while screening out anything that doesn't signal future aspirations. For example, if you want corporate partners eventually, get at least one before you start. If you want to reach full potential in the domestic market, hold off on international forays. <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/06/when_your_start-up_should_walk.html">Sometimes walking away from money is smart strategy</a> if it comes with unrelated requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Control your identity. </strong>Put the right words around the project, and stick with them. Observers often reduce innovations to familiar elements, using language they already have, but which might not fit the initiative, leading to offers of distracting opportunities when the core business isn't understood. One innovation group developed a glossary of terms to be used, and words to be avoided. The same group also declined an investment from a source that would have sent misleading signals about the business the venture was in. </p>

<p><strong>Don't lean insular.</strong> Innovators can lean in so far that they become insular. talking only to those that agree with them or flatter them. Was Kodak's demise precipitated by being Rochester-centric, where they were top of the heap, rather than mingling more in Silicon Valley where people had different views of the future of photography? Bill, Mary, and Joe were so flattered by money that they didn't check with outside experts who would have warned them of the dangers ahead.</p>

<p>In short, to get to where you want to go, ignore the deadly temptations that might spring up on an innovation journey. Stay focused on the purpose and the destination.</p>

      <p>Research organizations like to increase team size to bring in new ideas, but a study of 549 research groups shows that in teams consisting of people from multiple disciplines, the published output per researcher in <strong>13-person</strong> groups was <strong>42% lower</strong>, on average, than in <strong>five-person</strong> groups, says a team led by Jonathon N. Cummings of Duke University. The greater the heterogeneity in disciplines, the less effective it was for groups to increase their size. In interviews, team members in large, heterogeneous groups complained of lack of familiarity and personal chemistry with colleagues and problems in communication, the researchers say.</p>

      <p>It's dismaying how easy it is to screw up college.</p>

<p>I don't know exactly when, why, or how it happened, but important things are breaking down in the US higher education system. Whether or not this system is in danger of collapsing it feels like it's losing its way, and failing in its mission of developing the citizens and workers we need in the 21st century.</p>

<p>This mission clearly includes getting students to graduate, yet only a bit more than half of all US students enrolled in four-year colleges and universities <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/27/us-attn-andrea-education-dropouts-idUSBRE82Q0Y120120327">complete their degrees within six years</a>, and only 29% who start two year degrees finish them within three years. America is last in graduation rate among 18 countries assessed in 2010 by the OECD. Things used to be better; in the late 1960s, nearly half of all college students got done in four years.</p>

<p>Have graduates learned a lot? In too many cases, apparently not. One of the strongest bodies of evidence I've come across showing that students aren't acquiring many academic skills is work done by sociologists Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa and summarized in their book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Academically-Adrift-Limited-Learning-Campuses/dp/0226028569">Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses </a></em>and <a href="http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED514983.pdf">subsequent research.</a><br />
 <br />
Arum, Roksa, and their colleagues tracked more than 2300 students enrolled full time in four-year degree programs at a range of American colleges and universities. Their findings are alarming: 45% of students demonstrate no significant improvement on a written test of critical thinking called the Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA) after two years of college, and 36% improved not at all after four years. And the average improvement on the test after four years was quite small. </p>

<p>Consider a student who scored at the 50% percentile as a freshman. If he experienced average improvement over four years of college, then went back and took the test again with another group of incoming freshmen, he would score only in the 68th percentile. The CLA is so new that we don't know if these gains were bigger in the past, but previous research using other tests indicates that they were, and that only a few decades ago the average college student learned a great deal between freshman and senior years.</p>

<p>These declines in learning and graduation rates come during a time of exploding costs. the <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/05/15/is-college-worth-it/">Pew Research Center found</a> that the price of a private college education tripled between 1980 and 2010, and that average student loan debt for bachelor's degree holders who had to borrow was more than $23,000 in 2011. This debt is not dischargeable even in bankruptcy, and is certainly not erased if you fail to graduate.</p>

<p>Smart students from affluent homes and elite colleges and universities continue to do really well, but the rest of higher ed is sliding backward. Why is this? As was the case with the sub-prime crisis and subsequent economic meltdown, there is plenty of blame to go around. Many non-elite colleges have seen their enrollments jump in recent decades without similar increases in budgets, so resources per student have declined. </p>

<p>It also seems, though, that colleges in general have stopped asking students to work as hard, and the students have been more than happy to take them up on that offer. Arum, Roksa, and their colleagues document that college students today spend only 9% of their time studying (compared to 51% on "socializing, recreating, and other"), much less than in previous decades, and that only 42% reported having taken a class the previous semester that required them to read at least 40 pages a week and write at least 20 pages total. They write that "The portrayal of higher education emerging from [this research] is one of an institution focused more on social than academic experiences. Students spend very little time studying, and professors rarely demand much from them in terms of reading and writing." </p>

<p>Here's my advice to recent high school grads (and their families): don't be part of this shameful and lazy bargain. Resolve to work hard, take tough classes, and graduate on time. Many changes are necessary in higher ed, most of which will take a great deal of time. But the most effective interventions can start the day you show up on campus. Crack the books, find good teachers, and take the education part of your education seriously.</p>

<p>Arum and Roksa found that at every college studied some students show great improvement on the CLA. In general, these are students who spent more time studying (especially studying alone), took courses with more required reading and writing, and had more demanding faculty. So the blueprint is here. Please take my advice and spend some time this summer thinking about how you'll put it into action.</p>

      <p>You've just walked out of your boss's office after a talent review session. At the end of the meeting, you received a clear message: although your organization is performing well, your boss believes you have a "B team" with no clear successor to your position &#8212; and you're expected to do something about it. But what isn't immediately clear.</p>

<p>Most managers know how to manage and coach individual B players, solid performers unlikely to rise within the organization. However, dealing with a team composed of all B players is one of the most problematic tasks a manager can face. The challenges stem from the fact that B players are blocking key developmental positions, that is, those most useful in developing the skills and experience of a successor or other upwardly-mobile staff.  And teams of people who stay in the same job for a long period of time tend to become static, as their members become comfortable with the status quo and less open to change and new ways of doing business. What makes the B team phenomenon so difficult to address is that you're dealing with a group of sound performers who are experienced, often committed to the best interests of the company, and, in the case of technical experts, difficult to replace. As a result, many managers are reluctant to take steps to deal with the situation. So, with your boss's admonition ringing in your ears, how can you upgrade your team and still be fair to your people, many of whom are loyal performers? </p>

<p>The short answer is that ultimately you'll need to free up some positions on your staff in order to bring in new blood from the outside or promote high-potential talent from within. As a starting point, I suggest that you define the mix of skills and experience someone would need to take your place and lead your organization into the future. Years ago, I worked with a senior executive who told me &#8212; quite honestly, I believe &#8212; that his most important responsibility was developing someone who could do his job better than he could. Not as well. Better. Behind his comment lay the notion that as the company grew, jobs became more complex and new skills sets were required. Depending on your role and the company's strategic priorities, that might include global experience, driving innovation, or making and integrating acquisitions. </p>

<p>Next, identify the positions in your organization that have the greatest developmental "pop" &#8212; the ones most useful in developing the skills and range of perspective your successor will need. These are the jobs you'll need to open up since they are critical training grounds for your job. By contrast in most organizations there are positions that require deep technical expertise or place a premium on the execution of established strategies. Having a B player makes sense in such assignments, as, for example, lead actuary in an insurance business or head of a large shared services group. </p>

<p>Once you have identified these critical developmental positions, work with the incumbents in those jobs to help them find other assignments within the company where they can contribute and add value in new ways. This can be challenging but is not impossible. For example, I have seen long-tenured people rotate from a staff role at headquarters to a field office or into the company's charitable foundation. Also, consider whether any of your supposed B players is a diamond in the rough who's been mis-categorized &#8212; someone who with coaching and the right set of experiences could emerge as an A player and possible successor. </p>

<p>Some managers fall into the trap of playing the hand they were dealt &#8212; that is, working exclusively to develop the people they inherited when taking over a new team. It's a serious trap I've seen even very senior executives fall into. In some conservative organizations it's the path of least resistance for managers if bringing in people from the outside is viewed as controversial and upsetting to existing staff. Over time such managers lose perspective on how their team members compare to talent available in the marketplace.  </p>

<p>The remedy is straightforward but requires both time and effort. To counteract this tendency, devote time to getting to know people outside your organization by working with a recruiter or joining a professional or industry group, both to find new talent and calibrate your current team members' talents. By meeting people outside the company, you'll expand your frame of reference, and often you'll begin to view your existing staff through a new lens &#8212; and be less willing to accept performance or behavioral deficiencies that seemed acceptable in the past. </p>

<p>Turning a B team into a high-performing group with the requisite mix of A and B players &#8212;  including at least one potential successor &#8212; demands time, finesse, and the willingness to have sometimes uncomfortable conversations with people, some of whom have been loyal lieutenants. </p>

<p>The major variable you control is time, so if you're leading a B team, the time to start addressing the situation is now. <br />

      <p>The project team had certainly prepared for the workshop. Its members had a carefully constructed PowerPoint document, replete with facts and figures that showed the attractiveness of what we'll call the booming management-training market in China (details have been disguised to protect the client's confidentiality). Embedded video clips showed potential customers raving about the offering the team had recently piloted. A meticulously constructed business plan showed how the venture could thoughtfully expand into six major cities in China. </p>

<p>Yet, the presentation highlighted a critical gap between the team and its senior management sponsors. Executives immediately began asking questions about why the team was focusing on only six cities. The team responded by saying that its model required substantial marketing and a large local staff. Smaller cities just couldn't support that overhead. Executives pressed, asking the team to figure out how to reach 100 cities. Team members assumed that meant going back to the drawing board to develop a business model that would be profitable in smaller cities. And that meant, they thought, sharply lower investments in marketing and smaller staff.</p>

<p>I stopped the meeting and asked the project leader and lead executive sponsor to write on a piece of paper what each thought the project's primary strategic intent was.<br />

"Create a business that generates attractive profits and has margins that are at or above corporate levels," read the project leader's note.</p>

<p>"Grow our brand presence in China," read the executive sponsor's note.</p>

<p>Now the disconnect was clear. While it was very clear what the team planned to do, its members hadn't verified their assumptions about <em>why</em> they were going to do it. Certainly, the end goal of many innovations is to generate financial returns. But, as this team found out the hard way, there are other reasons to innovate as well, such as boosting employee morale, having social impact, or bolstering a brand. </p>

<p>And whether or not achieving financial returns is the goal, the other thing the innovators should have taken care to clarify before starting to innovate was <em>how</em> the effort would be measured. And here they should be pushing to be as precise as possible. What are ultimate revenue targets? By when? What do operating margins have to be? </p>

<p>It's perilously easy for corporate innovators to skate past the why and the how, particularly those working in new-growth groups or incubators. Just as Tim Robbins told Morgan Freeman in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/quotes">The Shawshank Redemption</a> to either get busy living or get busying dying, corporate innovators feel the urgent need to get busy innovating, or have their existence questioned.</p>

<p>One mechanism some companies use to deal with this problem is to have each team complete a charter before it starts to work, detailing the project's strategic intent (the why), specific goals (the how), <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/anthony/2008/08/how_to_form_an_innovation_stra.html">strategic options </a> that are on and off the table, critical uncertainties, project resources (both people and money), identification of who is responsible for making which decisions, key strategic milestones, and the next project checkpoint.</p>

<p>One final piece of advice: be wary of well-intentioned executives who express discomfort about approaching innovation in a structured way or about placing boundaries on innovation efforts. It feels good to say, "We're open to anything," but in my experience, it's never true. Make sure you're clear about the rules of the game from the beginning &#8212; particularly the why and the how &#8212; to save time and rework later. <br />

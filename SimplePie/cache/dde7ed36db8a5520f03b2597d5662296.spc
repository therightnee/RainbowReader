      <p>The principal role of a CMO has always been to be a great storyteller. Once upon a time, this meant waxing eloquently about the brand's promise, giving people a hero to cheer for and something to relate to and believe in. And the process of storytelling used to be fairly simple: create an ad, place it in a magazine, newspaper or on the radio or TV, and you were done. Today, we live in an entirely different world &#8212;  one in which brand narratives are often co-opted, molded and even created by consumers. </p>

<p>This means the journey now taken by brands and consumers together is filled with many more twists and turns. It spans the web, social networks and mobile devices, a dazzling array of digital means to access information, make decisions, buy products and then share purchases, opinions and ideas about brands. </p>

<p>Each of these stops along the journey is a point of light in the digital mosaic that creates a brand narrative built on billions of interactions. As we've seen, the brand narrative can become something wildly different from the one the CMO envisioned.  </p>

<p>How can today's digital CMO navigate this new landscape? Here are a few simple steps you can take to chart the best course for your brand story.</p>

<p><strong>1. Craft Narratives Around the Right Digital Storytelling Tools </strong></p>

<p>There is no pun intended when I say, "don't leave customers to their own devices." Every digital CMO should devise ways to guide the consumer to connect with the brand story on different platforms. Think about where your brand fits into all that pinning, posting, sharing, filtering, and tagging. Help consumers engage with your narrative by making it easy to digest and share it, using the tools that matter most to your audience. </p>

<p>At the same time, take into account that your narrative needs to be designed to succeed across multiple devices &#8212;  sometimes simultaneously, sometimes sequentially. Consumers are using the iPad and other tablets in very different ways than a desktop or smartphone. In comparison, while the smartphone is a very small landscape, if executed thoughtfully, brand stories can be delivered there in a simple and compelling way.</p>

<p>For example, Sephora, the beauty and cosmetics retailer, offers a mobile app to help customers navigate their stores, a website for more traditional e-commerce, and an iPad experience for inspiration and discovery. They've also enabled their fans and followers to actively share and solicit advice via Facebook and Pinterest. Each digital experience, while created for different channels, speaks to a common storyline: they are the "Beauty Insiders" &#8212;  with the latest and greatest in beauty trends to share with you, one of their best friends.</p>

<p><strong>2. Build Bendable Storylines</strong></p>

<p>Because the feedback loop can completely re-shape a brand story, the digital CMO must be ready to embrace a new course. One way is to design a brand discourse that is flexible from the start. By building these bendable storylines, CMOs will be ready to co-opt a better narrative if one emerges. </p>

<p>Agile narratives can allow you to take advantage of positive trends or even a world-changing event. Being prepared is of the utmost importance. Be sure to free up resources after a campaign hits the marketplace so that if something resonates with your customers, you can allocate funding accordingly and focus aggressively on what &#8212;  unexpectedly or not &#8212;  is taking root. </p>

<p>Airbnb, a service enabling people to rent out their spare rooms or entire homes, is a great example of a company that understands the new age of shapeable storylines. For example, during Superstorm Sandy Airbnb's local community base in New York City rallied to launch a microsite that allowed people living nearby the storm-ravaged region to donate a room or couch and help Sandy victims find a place to stay at no charge. This required a fast redesign of their booking and payment system to accommodate the emergency free shelter option. No doubt it was an investment well worth the effort, not only aligning with the community-powered notion at the core of the company's brand story, but taking the narrative in an entirely new direction. </p>

<p><strong>3. Create Content Worth Sharing</strong></p>

<p>Before the digital age it didn't much matter if content was worth sharing because there wasn't usually the option to do so. "Sharability" is now a key ingredient of any successful brand narrative that has a chance of resonating with the consumer. Connect to emotions and ideas that are bigger and more interesting than selling your products, and they will speak for themselves.</p>

<p>TED, the non-profit conference organization, has perfected this model. Their tagline is of course, "Ideas Worth Spreading" and they've hit the nail on the head. Instead of stacking their site with the thousands of talks that they have tape each year, they choose only the most compelling and interesting talks to highlight and put all their resources, including social channels and blog, behind promoting one outstanding talk per day. This highly curated approach to creating genuine content that is worth sharing is what has made the brand so successful &#8212;  and it's the reason that TED talks surpassed one billion views worldwide last year.</p>

<p>Today's digital CMO has a harder job than the CMO of the past. But ultimately it's a more exciting one. As chief storyteller, you have more opportunities to develop compelling and relevant brand identities by including your customers in the narrative creation process right from the start. And consumers have shown time and time again that they trust brands that trust them. And while sometimes scary, that can't be a bad thing.</p>

      <p>We often write about B-school research findings in this space. Now we're going to let you take part. This video, presented by Harvard Business School associate professor Michael Norton, is a game. In fact, it's the same game Norton used in research he recently conducted, so when you play the game here, you'll be doing exactly what Norton's subjects did. The game is simple and doesn't take long. </p>

<p>To play it, you'll need a friend. Once you have a friend with you, just play the video and listen to Norton's instructions. When you're done, Norton will walk you through his findings.</p>

      <p>McDonald's and Walmart, the two biggest private-sector employers in the U.S., don't pay their workers much. This more or less eternal truth is making one of its increasingly frequent appearances in the news this week. McDonald's is <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/07/15/2300321/mcdonalds-buget-low-wage/">catching flak</a> for a "<a href="http://www.practicalmoneyskills.com/mcdonalds/budget/budget2.php">sample monthly budget</a>" for employees that sets aside $20 a month for health insurance and no money at all for heat. (Hey, it's <em>July</em>.) Walmart, meanwhile, is <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/07/16/202688889/d-c-wage-rift-puts-spotlight-on-wal-marts-urban-push">threatening to cut back on plans to open stores in Washington, D.C.</a>, after the D.C. council <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-29/local/40269371_1_wal-mart-s-gray-wal-mart-representatives">voted</a> to impose a "super minimum wage" of $12.50 an hour on big retailers.</p>

<p>For decades, most discussions of pay levels and income disparity in the U.S. have been accompanied by a pronounced economic fatalism. Pay is set by the market and the labor market has gone global, the reasoning goes &#8212; and when a Chinese or Mexican worker can do what an American can for less, wages <em>have to</em> go down. In explaining what's happened to autoworkers, say, that story makes some sense (although it <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickallen/2011/12/21/germany-builds-twice-as-many-cars-as-the-u-s-while-paying-its-auto-workers-twice-as-much/">doesn't explain why German autoworkers have for the most part kept their high pay and their jobs while Americans haven't</a>).</p>

<p>But McDonald's burger-flippers and Walmart checkout clerks can't be replaced by overseas workers. Instead, both companies were able to build low pay into their business models from the beginning &#8212; McDonald's because so much of its workforce was made up of living-at-home teenagers who did not in fact have to pay for heat, Walmart because of its roots in small Southern towns where wages were low and "living wage" laws unheard of. Now McDonald's is increasingly staffed by grownups (teens have <a href="http://www.workforce.com/article/20070725/NEWS01/307259992">gone from from 45% of its workforce in the 1990s to 33% recently</a>), while Walmart is trying to conquer the big cities of the North. Both companies have been understandably loath to depart from their low-pay traditions, so conflict and criticism are pretty much inevitable. Which is an extremely healthy development.</p>

<p>That's because it's becoming clear that pay levels <em>aren't</em> entirely set by the market. They are also affected by custom, by the balance of power between workers and employers, and by government regulation. Early economists understood that wage setting was "fundamentally a social decision," Jonathan Schlefer <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/11/how_economists_got_income_ineq.html">wrote on HBR.org last year</a>, but their 20th century successors became fixated on the idea of a "natural law" that kept pay in line with productivity. And this idea that wages are set by inexorable economic forces came to dominate popular discourse as well.</p>

<p>Since 1980, though, overall pay and productivity trends have <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/fox/flatmm/productivitygap2.jpeg">sharply diverged in the U.S.</a>. And since the 1990s, research on the impact of minimum wage laws has demonstrated that there <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/fox/2013/02/the-minimum-wage-and-textbook.html">clearly is some distance</a> between the textbook versions of how wages are set and how it happens in reality. It's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/22/a-15-minimum-wage-is-a-terrible-idea/">not that minimum wage laws work miracles</a>, but they also don't have nearly the downward effect on employment levels that a pure supply-demand model would predict. Not to mention that decades of <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/04/does_money_really_affect_motiv.html">research</a> at the <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/09/stop_wasting_money_on_motivati.html">organizational</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805">individual</a> level have shown the link between pay and on-the-job performance to be <a href="http://hbr.org/2003/01/one-more-time-how-do-you-motivate-employees/">extremely tenuous</a>.</p>

<p>If pay levels at Walmart, McDonald's, and elsewhere are at least to some extent a societal choice rather than the natural outcome of <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/edgy-optimist/2013/04/11/the-laws-of-economics-dont-exist/">economic law</a>, it raises a lot of interesting questions. One is whether the doldrums the U.S. economy has found itself in since the early 2000s might to at least some extent have been inflicted by corporate executives committed to keeping labor costs down. In 1914, Henry Ford famously <a href="http://corporate.ford.com/news-center/press-releases-detail/677-5-dollar-a-day">more than doubled wages at his factories</a>, mainly to fight attrition but also so that Ford's assembly line workers could afford to buy the cars they were making. By that standard, McDonald's and Walmart are doing okay &#8212; their workers can afford to buy their (remarkably inexpensive) products. But Ford's workers could buy a lot of other things, too, and they and their counterparts at other automakers went on to form the bulwark of a giant new American middle class that helped drive economic growth for decades.</p>

<p>Economic analysis of Ford's decision has focused on the efficiency gains of paying higher-than-market wages &#8212; less turnover and more-productive workers led to higher profits and higher market share, <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w2101">the reasoning goes</a>. That in itself is a big deal. But the even bigger argument that by raising wages Ford might have led a shift in societal norms that put more money in average Americans' pockets, thus boosting consumer spending and economic growth, hasn't had much appeal to mainstream economists in the U.S..</p>

<p>In fact, most of the interest has instead been in how hyperefficient operations like McDonald's and Walmart boost living standards by delivering their products to consumers at ever-lower cost. A few years ago, Jason Furman &#8212; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/10/president-obama-nominates-jason-furman-chairman-council-economic-advisers">recently tapped</a> to become Chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, argued that <a href="http://www.mackinac.org/archives/2006/walmart.pdf">Walmart was a "progressive success story"</a> because it had driven retail prices down so much. "Even if you grant that Wal-Mart hurts workers in the retail sector &#8212; and the evidence for this is far from clear," he wrote, "the magnitude of any potential harm is small in comparison."</p>

<p>It's a provocative argument, and it might even be right. But it's unlikely that it's the whole story. For all its productivity innovations, Walmart has also been a key player in a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom">race to the bottom</a>" that has tamped down wages and dismantled worker protections in the U.S. in recent decades. It's at least worth asking if the economy would be better off with a race in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The most outspoken and visible (visible to me, at least) proponent of this view over the past couple of years has been, interestingly enough, <em>Business Insider</em> editor-in-chief Henry Blodget. As he <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/profit-margins-high-wages-low-2013">put it on May Day this year</a>, corporate America's penchant for putting short-term shareholder interests above those of workers "is actually starving the rest of the economy of revenue growth." Can Blodget prove this? No. Is it a valid topic for economic research and political debate that ought to be getting more attention? You betcha.</p>

      <p>When we first decided to move the headquarters of our software company from Atlanta, we didn't think of Silicon Valley. In fact, Silicon Valley wasn't even on our short list. At Infor, we chose New York City.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why Silicon Valley might have been a top contender: for years, it's been the premier technology hub of the world. Talent flocks to companies like Google, Facebook, and Oracle, just as it does to the slew of start-ups looking to become the next big thing. Universities like Stanford, Caltech, and UC Berkeley continue to churn out the next generation of founders and engineers. Why would we turn to any other place to start Infor's next chapter? </p>

<p>In a word: culture. While no one can dispute Silicon Valley embodies the quintessential technology culture, there's another piece of the culture equation that matters just as much for a company like ours: diversity. </p>

<p>When I say diversity, I don't just mean racial and ethnic diversity &#8212; <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/trulia/2012/11/13/finding-diversity-in-america/">San Jose actually has New York beat on that front</a>. But our company makes software that is used across dozens of industry verticals &#8212; automotive, health care, hospitality, and the public sector &#8212; each with their own specific needs and goals. So when we talk about diversity, we are talking about the diversity of customers, the diversity of job functions, the diversity of backgrounds, the diversity of training. A walk down almost any street in Manhattan is likely to involve brushing shoulders with a huge cross-section of professionals. When you put it all together, you have an environment so rich and varied in skill sets and perspectives that Silicon Valley just can't match it. We believe that when this incredible professional diversity collides with software engineering talent, you have the recipe for breakthrough innovation. </p>

<p>Further, Silicon Alley offers an alternative to the closed environment of Silicon Valley (e.g. the campuses of the "Googles" and "Facebooks") that keep "tech workers from having even accidental contact with the surrounding community," <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_packer?currentPage=all)">according to <em>The New Yorker</a></em>. Those accidental (and non-accidental) interactions are what spur creativity &#8212; working and collaborating with different people is what inspires new ideas and new thinking &#8212; it's what drives us at Infor, and more reason why New York and its open community was the right fit for us. </p>

<p>Infor has already benefitted by tapping this local talent pool is our in-house creative agency, Hook & Loop, which helps us design software that is intuitive and easy-to-use. Our intention for Hook & Loop was not to hire the best and brightest software developers. Quite the opposite: we wanted to hire ad agency execs, fashion designers, and filmmakers &#8212; all people who would bring an outside perspective to business software, helping us create products more powerful and intuitive than we might have ever imagined without their input.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/vc-percentchange.gif"><img alt="Percent Change in VC Money" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/vc-percentchange-thumb-365x174-4485.gif" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></p>

<p>We aren't the only tech company that's noticed New York's potential. Recent statistics speak volumes about the Big Apple's bright future in tech, including 486 new tech companies that have emerged since 2007, with start-ups popping up every day. A <a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130213/TECHNOLOGY/130219966">report by PrivCo</a> shows that in 2012 there were 100 mergers and acquisitions for privately-held tech companies in NYC, with an accrued value of up to $8.3 billion. Further, <a href="http://nycfuture.org/data/info/seeding-nycs-startup-success">according to the Center for an Urban Future</a>, tech jobs in the city have grown almost 30% in five years, with no signs of slowing down anytime soon. The center also reports that between 2008 and the beginning of 2013, New York saw a 24 percent gain in the number of venture capital deals, while Silicon Valley dropped by 21 percent.</p>

<p>New York is also creating the infrastructure to grow and develop technology talent organically. In January, Cornell's NYC Tech campus (located on Roosevelt Island) opened its doors to a class of students pursuing master's degrees in computer science. In addition, NYU opened a new urban science graduate school in Downtown Brooklyn in April, and Columbia is creating an Institute for Data Sciences and Engineering, expected to open this fall.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/vc-changeinshare.gif"><img alt="Percent Change in Share of VC Money" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/vc-changeinshare-thumb-365x179-4487.gif" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>But the talent isn't just coming from inside the city, and the influx isn't just recent college graduates. Established executives, like former Yahoo! executive <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100553792">Chad Dickerson</a> (founder of popular crafts e-commerce site Etsy), are moving from the West Coast to join the New York City tech scene. And while larger companies such as Infor, Ernst & Young, and JP Morgan are hiring from this talent pool, the NYC-born startups that are also <a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130206/TECHNOLOGY/130209953">attracting global talent</a>. By offering flexible hours, a fun work environment, and career growth opportunities, start-ups like <a href="http://www.catchafire.org/">Catchafire</a>, <a href="http://qlabs.com/">Qlabs</a>, and <a href="http://crowdtap.com/">Crowdtap</a> are able to hire unique talent to help them raise capital and grow their businesses.</p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg's new "<a href="http://wearemadeinny.com/">We Are Made In NY</a>" campaign points out that there are currently 900 tech startups hiring for over 3,000 jobs. The campaign highlights the city's burgeoning digital industry and underscores the Mayor's commitment to nurturing a thriving tech sector. "Growing our local tech industry is an important part of our economic development strategy to bring new businesses to our city and more job opportunities to New Yorkers," said Mayor Bloomberg. And what's even more interesting, between 2007 and 2011, a time when venture capitalism was down 11% nationally, New York saw growth of 32%. </p>

<p>Once we did <a href="http://www.infor.com/company/news/pressroom/pressreleases/NYCHeadquarters/">relocate Infor's headquarters</a> to New York last year, we found that we were scheduling up to five times more in-person customer meetings because of the location, which is having a significant impact given that 98% of companies that demo products on-site end up buying  our software. That statistic is especially powerful considering the number of C-level executives that routinely visit New York City. It's a tremendous opportunity.  </p>

      <p>The recent toppling of Australia's first female prime minister, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10398741">Julia Gillard</a>, continues to raise questions about women and leadership. Gillard was regarded as smart, capable and resilient. However, a string of bad decisions and  broken promises  had the public and politicians questioning her capacity to lead. In her final exit speech before Kevin Rudd took her place, Gillard responded to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihd7ofrwQX0">"gender wars"</a> discourse that had come to represent her leadership, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/26/julia-gillard-australia-prime-minister-kevin-rudd">saying</a> that "the reaction to being the first female PM"&#8212;in other words, gender&#8212;did not explain everything nor did it explain nothing.</p>  <br />
<p>So, when do we know it's about the gender and not about the leadership? <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/02/what_women_want_in_their_leade.html<br />
">My research</a> on women and leadership concluded that it was difficult to make any generalizations about women and leadership simply because there were so few women leading organizations. It was difficult to distinguish between the woman doing the leading and whether her manner of leadership was specifically her own or part of a gendered pattern of leading. To paraphrase Gillard, gender explained something about leadership but did not explain everything.</p>  <br />
<p>So what can help women leaders make the most of their own style of leadership? How to keep the focus on leadership, not gender? Here are three suggestions.</p>  <br />
<p><b>Understand the relationship of power to authority.</b> Understanding the connection between power and authority means that you know that having power does not give you authority. With power, you can carry out your own will; with authority, your command will be carried out by others. Others need to respect the leader's power and her authority to lead. This is why women are divided over quotas and affirmative action. While these measures may elevate more women powerful positions, the perception is that they are somehow not deserving. In other words, power can be given, but authority has to be earned. Authority is a social relationship between the leader and followers. It requires consensus: mutual expectation and mutual recognition. A legitimate rise to power carries with it the authority to lead. Because leaders need to achieve their power through their talent and through others' recognition of their talent, ensure you have the authority to lead.</p> <br />
<p><b>Recognize that being first isn't always best.</b> While "the first woman..." may be heralded as an achievement for womankind, this may not be for the longer term good. As the saying goes, you only get one chance to make a first impression; therefore, while some women may be given opportunities to lead and create a historical moment, they need to determine whether being first will enhance or detract from their leadership. Sheryl Sandberg and Marissa Mayer lead dynamic, diverse, and creative organizations that rely on the next new thing. They have an integral understanding of their organization and the need to update and innovate. Their leadership is suited to the context. Many younger women are well qualified, well connected, and have enough determination to lead, yet they may be missing the key ingredient that will enhance their leadership: wisdom. Wisdom <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-013-1692-4">means</a> having advanced levels of cognitive, reflective, and affective capacity, and these factors have a positive effect on followers. The beginning of wisdom is to make a personal assessment of the leadership role in context. Is wisdom a hidden asset in the job? If so, then it may be wiser to wait for the next opportunity to lead.</p> <br />
<p><b>Make sure you have sufficient resources and support.</b> In their <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8551.2005.00433.x/full<br />
">research</a> on the <a href="http://hbr.org/2011/01/how-women-end-up-on-the-glass-cliff">glass cliff phenomenon</a>, Michelle Ryan and Alex Haslam identified the tendency to appoint women leaders in times of crisis but also showed a pattern of these women leaders inevitably failing. Further analysis showed that the failure was not because of the leadership itself, but rather because the leadership was under-supported and under-resourced. With limited resources and support, women leaders desperately try to implement their strategic vision for renewal&#8212;but they inevitably fail as their vision and strategy cannot be implemented. An important lesson for any woman taking a leadership appointment is to ensure that you have the resources and support that you need to make it work; without them, your leadership will be precarious and likely to fail.</p>  <br />
<p>Leadership requires certain conditions to flourish, under which women&#8212;and men&#8212;can make good leaders. As more women take up the challenges of leadership, to avoid the gendered stereotyping of their leadership, they  need to have the authority and wisdom to lead, and all the resources and support necessary for leadership. </p>

      <p>After tsunamis, protests, wildfires, and riots &#8212; to name just a few recent major disruptions &#8212; few managers can be unaware of companies' vulnerability to the vagaries of politics and extreme weather.<br />
 <br />
You'd think. Yet three quarters of the <a href="http://www.apqc.org/knowledge-base/documents/managing-risk-supply-chain-disruption-survey-summary-report">195 large companies surveyed recently</a> by <a href="http://www.apqc.org/">APQC</a> got hit by an unexpected major supply chain disruption in the last 24 months. We are talking here about an unforeseen event involving a physical asset owned by the enterprise or a third party. Major means an event that has the potential to severely interrupt a business' ability to deliver on its promises to customers &#8212;  perhaps a power station for a vital assembly plant going dark for months. Survey responders (mostly supply chain risk operators) said things got so bad that C-suite executives had to get involved in the fix-it process for a sustained period of time. <br />
 <br />
But these are the same senior executives and middle managers that have supposedly been embracing formal enterprise risk management (ERM) for some time. Why did these systems fail so spectacularly?</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/supplychaindisruption.gif"><img alt="Supply Chain Disruption Isn't an Anomaly " src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/supplychaindisruption-thumb-200x354-4492.gif" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></p>

<p>Part of the problem stems from the familiar gap between the talk and the walk.  Survey findings indicate that most organizations' leaders did indeed express concern about the impact of political turmoil, natural disasters, or extreme weather.  But the findings also show that the people at the front lines of the business were hamstrung by a lack of visibility into risk. Nearly half said they lacked the resources needed to adequately assess business continuity programs at supplier sites. Many relied on the suppliers filling out perfunctory, unreliable checklists.<br />
 <br />
It's likely that the push to protect profits during the recession made matters even more difficult for supply chain operators. Seventy percent of the respondents to the APQC survey say their organizations pruned their lists of suppliers over the past five years, with the intent to reduce costs. Moreover, nearly three-quarters (74%) of the companies over the period added suppliers physically distant from their facilities, with 63% acknowledging that their suppliers are located in areas of the world known for high-impact natural disasters, extreme-weather events or political turmoil. It appears the urge to source in low-cost regions clouded the cost-versus-risk calculus for some.</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/supplychaintriplewhammy.gif"><img alt="Triple Whammy" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/supplychaintriplewhammy-thumb-580x197-4494.gif" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>  <br />
Finally, supply chain disruption risks often got painted as an operations-level risks and for that reason never made it onto the list of 15 or so major strategic/enterprise risks assessed and managed by the Chief Risk Officer's formal ERM process. Many ERM assessments focus on risks related to competitive strategy or the customer experience. The result is that too many boards don't think to ask about &#8212;  and are not briefed on &#8212;  the risks of, say, sourcing key components in risky regions of the world. They wind up blind, therefore, to many crucial strategic risks.</p>

<p>"The important thing is to figure out what might be a severe disruption and to do this you have to look down into the different tiers of supply. People at the top need to ask: 'What might be out there that we are not currently aware of,'" says <a href="http://new.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/tobin/facultyadmin/faculty/paul_walker.stj">Dr. Paul Walker, an expert in ERM at St. John's University in New York.</a></p>

<p>The good news in all of this is that nearly half of the survey respondents said that their firms are now adding rigor to the process of assessing supply chain resiliency. Let's hope the purse strings will be loosened enough to get this right.</p>

      <p>Newly hired employees of an Indian call center were at least <strong>60% less</strong> likely to leave within a period of a few months if they went through an onboarding process that, instead of emphasizing conformity, focused on their individual strengths, for example by highlighting what was "unique" about them, says a team led by Daniel M. Cable of London Business School. In a related lab experiment, new hires whose individual strengths were highlighted ended up performing more efficiently and making fewer errors. Thus the best way for an organization to develop early organizational commitment may be to encourage employees to make daily use of their unique strengths, the researchers say.</p>

      <p>People love to talk about the ROI from social media. But ROI doesn't just fall from the sky. If you want your social media efforts to drive actual sales, you need to understand how your customers and potential customers actually use social media in their purchase process. And once you have that understanding, you need to tailor your social media strategy so that it pushes your customers towards a purchase. </p>

<p>The latest issue of the <em>Harvard Business Review</em> shares research findings that can help you tailor your Pinterest strategy. <a href="http://hbr.org/2013/07/how-pinterest-puts-people-in-stores">How Pinterest Puts People in Stores</a>, which I co-authored with my Vision Critical colleague David Sevitt, shows the impact of Pinterest on purchasing. As part of <a href="http://www.visioncritical.com/socialtosale?utm_source=landing+page&utm_medium=HBR+Blog&utm_campaign=HBR-SOCIAL-2013">a larger study</a> that compared the impact of Pinterest, Twitter, and Facebook on sales, David and I uncovered patterns in Pinterest use that point towards the following best practices for businesses using Pinterest: </p>

<p><strong>Combat showrooming.</strong> Retailers often worry that the Internet has turned brick-and-mortar stores into little more than showrooms: places where customers maul the merchandise and pester salespeople for advice before going online to buy the same products at a lower price. But our study of social media-driven purchasing showed that social media sends more customers <em>into</em> stores than the Internet pulls <em>out</em>: 1 in 5 Pinterest users has bought something in a store after pinning or liking it on Pinterest, and 1 in 3 Pinterest users under 35 has done so. If you want more people walking through the door of your store with a purchase in mind, design your Pinterest strategy to send as many people to your stores as to your website. </p>

<p><strong>Drive personal pinning.</strong> While 60% of Pinterest purchases were discovered on Pinterest, the vast majority were discovered through the boards or streams of regular human beings: 19% of purchases were discovered through a friend, and 24% through a stranger, compared to just 7% being discovered on a retailer's Pinterest board, and 10% through Pinterest search. That means you can't rely on your own Pinterest presence to drive significant sales, and instead need to think about how to drive repinning (where your viewers and customers share items they find on your pinboards to their own pinboards). To encourage customers to pin items from your site to their Pinterest boards, make sure you include a "share on Pinterest" button on every product page, and consider running promotions to encourage pinning (some <a href="http://pinterest.com/sweepslovers/pin-it-to-win-it-pinterest-promotions/">examples here</a>). To let your customers know that their pinning is appreciated, pay extra attention to the people who share your content the most, by repinning and liking their pins.</p>

<p><strong>Pack images with information.</strong> One of the major ways Pinterest influences purchasing is by providing additional information about a product. Any visitor who comes to your site from a Pinterest link should land on a page with relevant information about the product. Better yet, save them the trip by embedding product information directly in the images on your website and Pinterest boards, either with text or (better still) visual cues about product ingredients or usage. For example, compare two images from the Williams Sonoma site, and you'll see that <a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/408560997415265695/">one of them</a> instantly conveys the utility of a new kind of measuring cup, while <a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/121245414939092089/">the other leaves you wondering</a> &#8212; but it's the latter image that the company features on its own <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/flex-it-silicone-flexible-measuring-cup-set/?pkey=cmixing-bowls">product page</a>. Featuring the image that contains the most information about a product is the way to succeed on Pinterest. </p>

<p><strong>Pin that deal.</strong> Our Pinterest data was drawn from a larger study of nearly 6,000 social media users who also told us about the impact of Facebook and Twitter on their purchasing. But where 37% of Facebook users and 32% of Twitter users say that those networks helped drive their purchase by alerting them to a deal, only 19% of Pinterest-driven purchases involved finding a sale or deal through the site. This suggests massive room for growth by incorporating sale notifications into pinnable product images, or conversely, by enhancing the design of online sale announcements so they are charming or informative enough to get pinned. </p>

<p><strong>Engage with recent pinners.</strong> More than 40% of Pinterest-inspired purchases are made within one week of pinning, and 80% are made within three weeks. That means your best window for nudging customers towards purchase is within one to three weeks of the moment when they pin one of your products. This is the time to reach out to customers, ask if they need more information, or simply thank them for sharing. If you're in a business with high-value transactions (like real estate or car sales), it's well worth following up on the indication of interest represented by a pin by using Pinterest's own analytics or a <a href="http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/5-useful-pinterest-analytics-tools.html">third party tool</a> to see who is pinning items from your site or pinboards. If and when Pinterest finally releases its <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/06/18/the-disappointing-tale-of-pinterests-long-awaited-api#awesm=~ob2qh5f4QH5wNG">long-promised API</a>, expect to see the emergence of tools that can automate or facilitate this kind of tracking and response. </p>

<p>Talking to Pinterest users about their Pinterest-inspired purchases helped identify specific business tactics that align with the way people actually share and shop online. <a href="http://hbr.org/2013/07/how-pinterest-puts-people-in-stores">Explore the infographic</a> for more insight into how people use Pinterest in their purchasing process, and you may find your own proof of social media ROI. </p>

      <p>"Tackling climate change is one of America's greatest economic opportunities." So proclaims the <a href="http://www.ceres.org/bicep/climate-declaration">Climate Declaration</a>, a public statement signed by a fast-growing list of U.S. corporate giants, including GM, Nike, Intel, Starbucks, Unilever, eBay, Swiss Re, and even The Weather Channel.  </p>

<p>This new attempt to encourage companies to lobby for climate action is gaining steam. President Obama gave the movement a boost in June when he highlighted the declaration in his <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/winston/2013/06/obama-gave-a-monumental-climate-speech-but-its-still-not-enough.html">big climate speech</a>.</p>

<p>More companies are taking a proactive role in climate policy, and for good reasons. </p>

<p><strong>First, many of these corporate leaders believe that climate change is a risk <em>today</em>, not in some distant future.</strong> In the World Economic Forum's Global Risks 2013 report, the respondents named "rising greenhouse gas emissions" as the third most likely risk to the global economy (after inequity and deficits/debt).  There's too much at stake for the private sector to sit this one out - or worse, to lobby against policy and government action (which is basically the mission of the government relations function in most companies).  </p>

<p><strong>Second, it makes strategic sense to engage in the discussion now.</strong> As the impacts of climate change become even more evident, we will see calls for increased regulation to help us move away from carbon-emitting energy. Shouldn't companies get involved now instead of waiting to see what governments come up with on their own?</p>

<p><strong>Third, the leading companies realize that coordinated climate action will be very good for our economy and well-being.</strong> The Climate Declaration, created by the NGO <a href="http://www.ceres.org/">Ceres</a> as part of its <a href="http://www.ceres.org/bicep/climate-declaration">BICEP advocacy group</a>, makes a simple case for action: Taking on climate change will save money, improve efficiency, and drive innovation, all of which will keep America competitive internationally.  </p>

<p>The declaration is not about specific policy prescriptions &#8212; that's what BICEP is for &#8212; but more about bringing companies to the table to change the dialogue.  As Ceres' president <a href="http://www.ceres.org/about-us/who-we-are/ceres-staff/mindy-s.-lubber-jd-mba">Mindy Lubber</a> told me, the declaration is "an entry-level point for a large number of companies to come in and say 'climate is not a job-killing, regulation creating platform, but quite the opposite.'"</p>

<p>In other words, we're getting some of our corporate bigwigs on the record saying that building a clean economy is good for us.  These companies can help change the conversation &#8212; they have significant clout and reach, not just in Washington, but also through their extensive employee networks (millions of people), supply chains (hundreds of billions of purchasing), and marketing and social media machines (millions of tweeters).  </p>

<p>Before getting too excited about the potential here though, we should humbly remember that the Climate Declaration and BICEP are not the first attempts to engage companies in climate policy advocacy.  In 2007, Alcoa, GE, DuPont, Johnson & Johnson, Caterpillar, and other corporate giants formed the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (<a href="http://www.us-cap.org/">USCAP</a>), led mainly by the NGO Environmental Defense. USCAP called for large reductions in emissions, but focused mainly on supporting a "cap and trade" program. When the climate bill featuring this policy failed to pass through Congress in 2010, USCAP became quasi-defunct. </p>

<p>More recently, in 2011, a large group of mostly European companies, led by the Prince of Wales Corporate Leaders Group, signed the <a href="http://www.climatecommuniques.com/Past-Communiques/2-Degree-Challenge.aspx">2°C Challenge Communique</a>. This statement asked the world's governments to "break the deadlock on international negotiations" and enact policies that would hold global warning to 2 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Unlike in 2007 and 2011, it seems like there's a larger momentum for change now for the three reasons I mentioned above.  So what should companies advocate for specifically? My list of high-priority lobbying efforts includes (a) putting a price on carbon; (b) eliminating fossil fuel subsidies or potentially all energy subsidies; (c) encouraging massive public-private investment in the green economy; and (d) improving product and production efficiency standards for cars and appliances. </p>

<p>It doesn't take an advance political science degree to recognize that this list of policies will help us tackle climate change. What's new is that large companies are signing on to support these priorities.  BICEP's <a href="http://www.ceres.org/bicep/principles">specific policy goals</a> run along the same lines, and the Prince of Wales' group created a more targeted <a href="http://www.climatecommuniques.com/Carbon-Price-Communique.aspx">Carbon Price Communique</a> to push for the most important policy of all.</p>

<p>But let's be honest: in the end, statements are just that. To back up the intentions, we need aggressive corporate lobbying on the ground in statehouses and Congress. Only then, when these companies fight with gloves off, will we break down the perception that business is against carbon reductions. Some very powerful groups with deeply vested interests &#8212; basically the fossil fuel industry and some powerful co-conspirators <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/koch-brothers-climate-change_n_3530397.html">like the Koch brothers</a> &#8212; are still fighting hard to maintain the status quo. </p>

<p>But the other corporate bigwigs who know that they, and all of us, will benefit from aggressive climate policies need to speak loudly to legislators, employees, and citizens.  And with the Climate Declaration, it looks like that's finally beginning to happen.</p>

      <p>There's a chasm widening between old school and new school marketers. New school marketers, typically those closer to social marketing channels targeted at Millennials, are telling me they're having a hard time getting their projects funded internally because old school marketers in the C-suite don't understand the new context and metrics driving social marketing.</p>

<p>This often results in CMOs retreating to their comfort zones and wasting money on what I call "studio-based" marketing channels, which still take their cue from the traditional awareness-consideration-action sales model that was <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/the_consumer_decision_journey">debunked almost five years ago by McKinsey</a>. </p>

<p>Studio-based channels require the slow and methodical creation of studio assets (via film or photo shoot) with the goal of beaming the creative to a designated "appointment" (a slot on <em>Modern Family</em>). The guiding principle is the content itself &#8212; any hope of conversation around that creative is mitigated by a marketing (not consumer) defined hashtag burned into the spot. It's a one-way proposition at best, as useless and pretentious as the ethnocentric American who shouts the same thing louder and louder hoping that the Korean tourist he's giving directions to will finally understand.</p>

<p>This type of marketing isn't the be-all-end-all that it once was simply because the one unit of measure it relies heaviest on &#8212; time &#8212; is the same measure that will render its obsolescence. In today's social communities, quick-thinking and hustle (not a precious and polished spot) are the currencies most revered. That's because the audience most addicted to these social channels &#8212; Millennials &#8212; expect brands to live in the same world they live in, speaking the same language about the same issues they care about, find humorous, or strike an emotional chord. And since this generation collaborates online more freely than any other, the exponential reward of their sharing pays off with a far higher return on customer acquisition. For every Millennial customer acquired, chances are you'll acquire another two Millennials for free just from their word-of-mouth endorsement on social channels (the "share" at its purest form).</p>

<p>In order to create content that thrives in this social environment and maximizes shareability &#8212; people having conversations related to your brands &#8212; marketers need to behave less like studios that charge by the hour and more like newsrooms that charge by the word (even if those words are limited to a mere 140 characters).  </p>

<p>For brands that were born into the world with a Facebook page on launch day &#8212; think Virgin America, Lululemon, and Warby Parker (the Ryan Gosling of brands at the moment) &#8212; conversions don't result from shouting product promotions; they result from a deeper emotional connection stemming from what's actually going on in its customers' lives and communities. It's almost like making new friends in high school: You don't walk up to someone and say, "Be my friend. Be my friend! I'll pay for your lunch if you be my friend!" You need a savvier approach, striking up a conversation about <a href="http://longform.org/posts/sponsor-the-warby-parker-guide-to-summer-in-the-city">something you may have in common with the prospective friend</a>. </p>

<p>In order to contribute to and sustain a presence in social communities, brands need to post with the in-the-know mentality of your hyper-social friend on Facebook or Twitter &#8212; the one who's exhausting to hang out with, but still knows what's hot at the end of the day.</p>

<p>I refer to this method as "newsroom marketing". Every post, every engagement is breaking news optimized for the speed of pop culture. In this model, it takes hours, not weeks, to create content &#8212; and it will cost you less than a :30 network ad on TV. These newsroom tactics complement typical display advertising, which now has the job of <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/06/measurement_in_a_constantly_connected_world.html">retargeting the user</a> with promotional messaging several sites after the prospect enjoyed the newsroom-style branded engagement. </p>

<p>If all goes according to plan, the brand's daily commentary becomes the opening joke of a stump speech, and the audience is more likely to consider that brand's products and services when they are prepped for product investigation or purchase. Unlike studio marketing, the content isn't king; context is. </p>

<p>So how do you gain footing in this new arena? At Virgin Mobile, we made the decision to learn from platforms that thrive in this environment &#8212; and who in turn need brands to help fund their innovation through paid media.</p>

<p>Our results from working with BuzzFeed for the past year have been extraordinary. On the day Instagram launched on Android, for example, Virgin Mobile could have simply announced its arrival on our Facebook page.  Instead, we created an emotional connection among fans. "<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/virginmobilelive/11-things-no-one-wants-to-see-you-instagram-5l87">11 Things No One Wants to See You Instagram</a>" hit a chord with readers who were huge Instagram fans, but could also relate to the trappings of tragic, try-hard Instagram posts. The piece's virality shot up, allowing for roughly 1.2 million views of the post from over 8,000 sharers across Facebook, Twitter, StumbleUpon, and LinkedIn. </p>

<p>In general, our subsequent clickthroughs from retargeted banner ads following campaigns like this are higher, and if we append a targeted flash sale to the campaign, we'll often see lifts of 95% in phone sales.  According to a Vizu study BuzzFeed conducted earlier this year, prospects who enjoyed our branded social content were 235% more likely to investigate Virgin Mobile for their next phone service versus those that didn't see our content. </p>

<p>Currently, Virgin Mobile boasts an average 3 million views a month for its social content, rivaling the online audiences of Pitchfork and <em>Rolling Stone</em>. Why? Because we create content on a platform that was perfectly optimized for shareability. The name of the post, the length of the list, the photos selected &#8212; all these choices were thoughtful results from the A/B tests that founder Jonah Peretti and his disciples ferreted through before <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/printer/articles/14770-buzzfeed-the-ad-model-for-the-facebook-era">indoctrinating them as gospel</a>. Of course, there are several platform options marketers can choose to take advantage of this trend in native advertising.  But to truly reap the benefits of it, marketers need to tailor all of their assets &#8212; even their studio assets &#8212; to drive prospects to conversion by bridging seductive content with hard-core commerce.  If a platform like BuzzFeed can optimize storytelling for content shareability, why can't marketers optimize storytelling for sharing products?</p>

<p>The social "share" metric has single-handedly redefined what it means to engage with an audience on a regular basis. New school marketers are less concerned with the unique monthly views on their microsites and are increasingly more obsessed with "owning the water cooler" &#8212; that is, owning the spaces where stories spread most. Even if you don't have a partner like BuzzFeed you can share a stream of photos on Instagram during Fashion Week, provide real-time commentary during the Oscars on Twitter, or create gasp-inducing fireworks GIFs on Tumblr to help strengthen your voice. </p>

<p>Before your C-suite execs finalize their bloated budgets in the fall, they should first take a hard look at the total "shares" from the campaigns conducted by their new school marketers.  Hopefully they'll realize that some of the best acquisition tactics are earned, not bought. In other words, stop acting like a marketer. Act like a friend.  </p>

      <p>The CIO paradox is a set of contradictions that lies at the heart of IT leadership. Be strategic and operational. Stay secure and boost innovation. Adopt emerging technologies, while weighed down by the past. Many CIOs have buckled under the CIO paradox, while others have managed to be effective despite it. In working with these successful CIOs over the years, I have found that they all share a common set of practices, philosophies and approaches.  We are in the midst of a computing renaissance, when all CIOs will need to raise their game and master this same set of practices. Herewith, three items that should have a permanent place on any CIO's "breaking the paradox" checklist. </p>

<p><strong>Sell the foundation</strong>  <br />
Most large companies have underinvested in IT for decades. They've spent the bare minimum, and that's been fine, since IT has had to function merely as a "keep the lights on" necessity. As long as the mainframe systems aren't broken, let's not fix them.  Today, however, technology innovation is creating a drastic change &#8212; across all major industries &#8212; in the way customers want to interact with their suppliers. Companies can no longer get away with treating IT as a commodity. These companies face a technical debt, and it's time to pay up.  </p>

<p>Most CIOs find it relatively easy to convince an executive team to invest in a technology that increases near-term revenue. They find it considerably harder to ask their colleagues to invest in a major infrastructure upgrade that will take 12 months or more before delivering direct business benefit. But all CIOs need to find a way to convince their peers that without these infrastructure investments, they will be mortgaging their company's future. Through visuals, storytelling, and metaphors that resonate with the company's business leaders, CIOs must develop the skill of showing their stakeholders that foundational investments are the table stakes of innovation. If they do not, they will get crushed between the rock and hard-place of legacy technologies and business demand.</p>

<p><strong>Grow blended executives</strong><br />
The companies that have underinvested in IT have also underinvested in IT talent.  IT leaders are a unique breed, and they need to possess a heady brew of business, technology, and interpersonal skills.  High-performing IT organizations appoint executives to sit at the intersection of business areas and the IT function, helping business leaders to shape their IT strategies and marshaling a technology team to deliver against that demand.  Ideally, these "business relationship executives" would have two heads: one for business and one for technology. Since cloning is still an imperfect science &#8212; and these gorgeously blended executives are in short supply in the talent market &#8212; companies will need to grow their own.   </p>

<p>The most effective approach to developing blended executives is to develop a program that rotates IT people into business roles, and business people into IT.  But regardless of which approach companies take, they need to start now.  We are in the midst of war for IT talent, and companies that always have to go outside for their IT leaders, are at a disadvantage.   A far better strategy is to take the people that they have and develop them into blended executives. You know you are on the right track when you walk into a business unit meeting, and from the dialogue taking place, you cannot easily distinguish the IT person from everyone else.</p>

<p><strong>Reach beyond IT</strong>  <br />
The IT function is not easy to manage.  IT is highly strategic, intensely operational, hard to staff and extremely expensive.  CIOs who are successful in running IT tend to develop expertise in important areas including project management, continuous improvement, people development, M&A, and strategic planning. These disciplines are critical to every other department in the company. CIOs who want to be effective in the future will extend their leadership and expertise beyond the IT function. They will set up enterprise project management offices; they will take the reigns as their company's continuous improvement champion; they will absorb HR and legal and procurement, along with IT, into a new Chief Shared Services Officer role. They will step out of their IT boxes because they know it is good for the company. They will not wait to be asked.  </p>

<p>With cloud, mobility, consumerization, and big data, the CIO paradox is not disappearing; it is growing stronger. The contradictory forces that define IT are getting more acute, and CIOs will work harder than ever to perform. Those who are already struggling under the paradox will continue to struggle. But those who can rise to the occasion, break the paradox, and deliver value in our new technology marketplace will secure themselves a place of leadership in what promises to be an exciting new era.</p>

      <p>We've heard the rallying cry for the past few years for companies to "be customer-centric" and to transform into "a social business." But what does that really mean?<br />
 <br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/02/speaking_with_one_voice.html">As I've said before</a>, It's hard for most organizations to come to any real consensus because each part of the company only sees one small sliver of the customer, a sliver that comes with different meanings and measurement: a segmentation profile in marketing, website traffic for the digital team, "call volume" to the customer service team, a "conversion" to the sales team, or an "impression" to the advertising team. The real risk here is that no one sees the customer as an <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/02/how_companies_avoid_spreadabil.html">actual human being</a>.</p>

<p>But the challenge the corporation really needs to answer &#8212; listening to and understanding the customer more deeply &#8212; can start with the concept of empathy: encouraging employees to put aside their particular duties with the company and put themselves in their customer's shoes.<br />
 <br />
This process need not require deeply specialized skills: it can be as simple as it sounds. The problem is, professional training has distanced us from fundamental principles of human communication. We now tend to focus on empirical data from survey results and analytics or customer insights from feedback forms and focus groups constrained by what the company knows to ask.<br />
 <br />
And, just as challenging, the differences in each of our professional trainings as we look across disciplines within any organization means that people think and talk differently about their relationship with that customer. Even more confusing, we are often using the same words for somewhat different purposes from department to department.<br />
 <br />
As a result, empathy with the customer, which is among the simplest of principles, can be among the most challenging to master, especially for employees managing communication with a community to which they've never actually belonged themselves.</p>

<p>At our agency, <a href="www.peppercomm.com">Peppercomm</a>, this core philosophy of listening and empathy has transformed the way we work. We strive to see ourselves as beholden not just to the clients paying us for our consulting but equally so to the audiences they seek to reach, who give their time and who ultimately determine the success of our clients' businesses.<br />
 <br />
We've largely accomplished this through putting a deeper focus on helping our clients see the world from the eyes of their various audiences. We make it a priority to think about the communications experience of various stakeholders at every step along the way.<br />
 <br />
Thinking this way is a challenge. We still find ourselves accepting assumptions passed along by clients about their audiences without thinking them through from the audience's perspective. Occasionally, we'll catch one another talking about the customer as a number, or a profile, or a concept instead of an actual human being. And we sometimes still realize that we have created a communications strategy or drafted content more intent on capturing what everyone within the company would like to communicate without much thought as to what audiences actually want or need to know.<br />
 <br />
Customer empathy is a goal we'll never claim to "master," because it requires constantly challenging ourselves to work as a team from the common place of the perspective of the customer, the employee, the journalist, or any other constituency. But we pride ourselves on holding it up as our rallying cry and our filter on a daily basis.<br />
 <br />
As all of our companies continue acclimating to the realities of today's communications environment, it's imperative that those of us who see listening and empathy as a critical determinant of organizational health make it a company priority. We must all ensure our daily work reflects these principles. And we have to spread that message, both vertically and horizontally, within our organizations (and, for those of us in professional services, inside those companies we work with).<br />
 <br />
It will likely be frustrating and occasionally disheartening, especially since it seems so deceptively simple. But it is vital work, not just for the sake of our companies but for those audiences we serve. Only when all employees, from the C-suite to the interns, work to truly understand the world from their customer's points of view can we truly call ourselves "customer-centric" and a "social business."<br />

      <p>The difference between winners and losers is how they handle losing. </p>

<p>That's a key finding from my ongoing research on great companies and effective leaders: no one can completely avoid troubles and potential pitfalls are everywhere, so the real skill is the resilience to climb out of the hole and bounce back.</p>

<p>Volatile times bring disruptions, interruptions, and setbacks, even for the most successful among us. Companies at the top of the heap still have times when they are blindsided by a competing product and must play catch-up. Sports teams that win regularly are often behind during the game. Writers can face dozens of rejections before finding a publisher that puts them on the map. Some successful politicians get caught with their pants down (so to speak) and still go on to lead, although such self-inflicted wounds are harder to heal. </p>

<p>Resilience is the ability to recover from fumbles or outright mistakes and bounce back. But flexibility alone is not enough. You have to learn from your errors. Those with resilience build on the cornerstones of confidence &#8212; accountability (taking responsibility and showing remorse), collaboration (supporting others in reaching a common goal), and initiative (focusing on positive steps and improvements). As outlined in my book <em>Confidence</em>, these factors underpin the resilience of people, teams, and organizations that can stumble but resume winning. </p>

<p>For anyone who wants to get beyond adversity or start over rather than give up, America is the Land of Second Chances. According to Jon Huntsman, former US Ambassador to China, getting back on our feet is an American strength widely admired in China. And everywhere, rapid recovery from natural disasters is increasingly a key to a robust economy. Entrepreneurs and innovators must be willing to fail and try again.  The point isn't to learn to fail, it is to learn to bounce back.</p>

<p>Some stumbles are due to circumstances outside of most people's control, including weather events and geopolitical shocks. But while people might not control the larger problem, they control their reactions to it &#8212; whether to give up or find a new path. Recession in Europe is an example. I recently spoke to European audiences at public conferences and within companies about cultivating resilience in their businesses even when markets are shrinking, so that they hold their own as recession continues and are well-positioned for recovery. A German machinery company showed resilience by growing its service contracts when demand for machines slowed, and it mobilized employees to find new service possibilities. An Italian cosmetics firm grabbed talent from job-shedding multinationals and increased its international marketing tied to both health and fashion; new sales followed. In both companies, like others described in my book <em>SuperCorp</em>, such initiatives were made possible by a strong sense of purpose that drew members together and motivated them to take responsibility to help the companies survive and thrive. Employees were resilient because they cared, and that made the companies resilient.</p>

<p>Complacency, arrogance, and greed crowd out resilience. Humility and a noble purpose fuel it. Those with an authentic desire to serve, not just narcissism about wanting to be at the top, are willing to settle for less as an investment in better things later. Raymond Barre, former Premier of France, after being defeated for reelection at the national level, ran for a lesser office as Mayor of Lyon and became a hero of his region. That's the strategy Eliot Spitzer is taking by running for a lesser city office after having been governor of a state. He showed remorse quickly when scandal surfaced and then reentered the public conversation talking about the issues, increasing his comeback prospects. </p>

<p>Some observers say it is harder for women to stage comebacks. Still, consider Martha Stewart. She served prison time for insider trading rather graciously, showing remorse, and that graciousness restored much of her fan base afterward.  In a more positive vein, Hillary Clinton was not a sore loser to President Obama in 2008 (though some of her followers were) and accepted his offer to become his Secretary of State. She's now perhaps even better-positioned for a 2016 Presidential run. In the long term, graciousness beats sour grapes.</p>

<p>Resilience draws from strength of character, from a core set of values that motivate efforts to overcome the setback and resume walking the path to success. It involves self-control and willingness to acknowledge one's own role in defeat. Resilience also thrives on a sense of community &#8212; the desire to pick oneself up because of an obligation to others and because of support from others who want the same thing. Resilience is manifested in actions &#8212; a new contribution, a small win, a goal that takes attention off of the past and creates excitement about the future.</p>

<p>Potential troubles lurk around every corner, whether they stem from unexpected environmental jolts or individual flaws and mistakes. Whatever the source, what matters is how we deal with them. When surprises are the new normal, resilience is the new skill.</p>

      <p>It was undoubtedly a high-quality piece of work. The project team had spent the past six months designing a new strategy to accelerate growth in a critical emerging market for a multibillion-dollar multinational. The summary document had that rare combination: a compelling long-term vision and a credible set of near-term actions addressing critical strategic unknowns. </p>

<p>The last page of the 50-page document concluded the compelling story with a small request &#8212; four dedicated individuals for six months and $250,000 to conduct an in-market pilot. The project leader believed the modest request would translate into an easy yes.<br />
 <br />
I could see the logic in that approach, but I feared it wasn't going to work the way she was expecting. In actual fact, I've found, saving "the ask" for the end of the document increases the risks of encountering a hidden enemy of innovation inside large companies: the "soft yes." This happens when executives get jazzed about a broad innovation strategy, nod their head vigorously in support of it, but stop short of committing real, tangible resources, however modest. </p>

<p>It was the four dedicated people that were going to be the sticking point, I thought. You almost always can find money in someone's budget, or find creative ways around financial constraints to progress a new idea. But there are only so many hours in the day. Executives often hesitate to hire additional staff ("What happens if this doesn't work &#8212; then what do we do?" they say). They're equally reluctant to ask their best performers to shift from what are perceived to be critical tasks related to running the core business to risky innovation efforts. </p>

<p>They're more comfortable asking busy people to add another item to their to-do list.  But since most people's incentives are tied to delivering against the core business, they'll likely nod their heads and agree to help out &#8212; but prioritize the tasks they feel they're being paid to do over the pursuit of uncertain ideas. </p>

<p>Thus, the soft yes &#8212; people agree (in principle) to your request, but they don't come through whole-heartedly. The net result is that innovation efforts limp along, making just enough progress to keep management intrigued, but not enough to have any material impact.</p>

<p>One way to avoid the soft yes is to make your resource request clear early &#8212; within the first 10 minutes of any review meeting. Be specific. Then lay out the logic for the request. Detail the metrics that senior management can monitor as they watch their investment. Consider creating an exit strategy in case things don't go according to plan. If you are hiring new people, for example, perhaps they could be redeployed to other functions, if things don't pan out. Or maybe they could be brought on using temporary contracts. End your meeting by repeating the resource request. If you obtain verbal agreement, send a written summary to stakeholders to nail it down. </p>

<p>This all might sound like overkill, but remember that companies left to their own devices will naturally default to executing today's business, not creating tomorrow's. Being clear in intent, consistent in your explanations, and persistent in getting formal agreement can ensure that you get the resources you need when you need them.</p>

      <p>Highly narcissistic CEOs were nearly <strong>3 times</strong> more likely than very un-narcissistic leaders to take bold steps to embrace potentially disruptive technologies when media interest in the disruption was high. But when interest was low, the narcissistic CEOs showed no such heightened propensity to act, says a team led by Wolf-Christian Gerstner of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany. The research, which analyzed the U.S. pharmaceutical industry when biotech was disrupting it, measured such actions as acquisition of biotech firms as a function of CEO narcissism (calculated by factors including the leaders' prominence in annual reports). Narcissistic CEOs, who crave admiration, tend to take bold action when there's an audience that is likely to see their actions as daring, the researchers suggest.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/01/why_csrs_future_matters_to_you.html">business case</a> for corporate social responsibility (CSR) is becoming easier and easier to make. You can argue that it <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/pal/bm/2003/00000010/00000004/art00008">boosts a company's brand</a>, <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/winston/2013/06/obama-gave-a-monumental-climate-speech-but-its-still-not-enough.html">manages risk</a>, and just plain <a href="http://www.triplepundit.com/2012/05/mit-study-sustainability-profitabilit/">saves money</a>. But perhaps most importantly the general public is clamoring for companies to enact good, fair business practices &#8212; and most of that public pressure comes through social media.</p>

<p>There are plenty of (very public) examples of businesses moved into more sustainable practices by a social media backlash: Immediately following this year's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/world/asia/death-toll-in-bangladesh-collapse.html?ref=global&_r=1&">factory collapse disaster in Bangladesh</a>, companies who sourced materials from the country <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/01/news/companies/bangladesh-factory-shoppers/index.html">quickly came under fire</a>; now retailers including H&M, Zara, and Abercrombie & Fitch have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/world/asia/bangladeshs-cabinet-approves-changes-to-labor-laws.html?ref=global&_r=0">banded together to create a safety plan to improve conditions in Bangladeshi factories</a>, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/gap-alliance-bangladeshi-worker-safety">the Gap was not far behind</a>. In another example, last year <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/01/susan-g-komen_n_1247262.html">the Internet cried foul</a> when the Susan G Komen foundation decided to yank funding for Planned Parenthood, and the outcry caused the non-profit to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/03/susan-g-komen-planned-parenthood_n_1252651.html">reverse its decision</a> within days. And in 2010, Greenpeace <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/kitkat/">attacked Nestlé with a viral video</a> over its use of unsustainable palm oil. After 3 months of holding its ground against <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20000805-36.html">vocal naysayers on Facebook</a>, the company <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/online-protest-drives-nestl-to-environmentally-friendly-palm-oil-1976443.html">finally agreed</a> to cancel contracts with vendors who clear cut rainforests to make room for palm oil plantations. (Nestlé is now <a href="http://www.triplepundit.com/2013/03/nestle-promises-shared-value-nutrition-water-rural-development/">much more proactive about CSR</a>.)</p>

<p>Feedback through social media is immediate, permanent, and extremely public. When individuals feel strongly about a company's performance on social or environmental issues, one small voice can quickly become a swarm, difficult for even the most shielded executive to ignore. For this reason, social has become a driving force in many companies' CSR agendas</p>

<p><strong>One of the easiest ways to be on the right side of the social media tide is to be proactive &#8212; and personal &#8212; by listening to feedback and responding in an authentic way.</strong> Firms that are excelling in this regard have active, branded Twitter accounts, but they also encourage their executives to use Twitter as well. You can easily reach <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveStangis">Dave Stangis, Campbell's Soup's CSR lead</a> on Twitter, where he talks about the company's initiatives as well as global sustainability issues. Another great example is <a href="https://twitter.com/bruno68">Bruno Sarda, Sustainability Operations Director at Dell</a>. Both of these execs, and many more, make their company's corporate sustainability extremely personal, just by being present and approachable to the people of Twitter. To get a similar impact, make sure that the people in charge of your social media accounts understand what your CSR efforts mean for your brand, and empower them to act in a positive way to support your company. </p>

<p>One company that is leading the way on using social media to inform its sustainability program and communicate about its CSR agenda is Unilever. The personal care product and food conglomerate has dozens of brands and thousands of products, which makes its sustainability program both extremely important and difficult to communicate, because it spans issues from health and hygiene to greenhouse gas reductions. Yet, Unilever has managed to bundle them all under one umbrella, the <a href="http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/uslp/">Unilever Sustainable Living Plan</a>. The plan includes a multifaceted plan for communicating progress through a wide variety of methods, from video to Facebook to <a href="http://www.triplepundit.com/2013/05/twitter-chat-17th-unilever-talks-about-sustainable-living-plan/">Twitter chats</a>. It also includes traditional advertising tactics and public awareness campaigns from <a href="http://realbeautysketches.dove.us/">Dove's Real Beauty Sketches</a> to a <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/11/change_consumer_behavior_with.html">Lifebuoy hand-washing campaign</a> delivered by roti in India. </p>

<p><strong>Behind every great communicator is a great strategy.</strong> These campaigns and individuals are successful because they reinforce the company's brand and goals around both sustainability and consumer engagement. Unilever is an excellent example of a company with a bold, high-level strategy which informs all its sustainability communications. The company uses a variety of in-person and virtual strategies &#8212; like its online global dialogue, the <a href="http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/news/news/sustainablelivinglabthebigdebate.aspx">Sustainable Living Lab</a>, which in April had 550 attendees from 80 countries. Participants were extremely active, sharing 1,750 comments on all aspects of sustainability. Through these initiatives, Unilever has demonstrated that interactive communication through social media is one regular component of its CSR strategy. This comprehensive strategy also allows communication teams at far reaching brands from Dove to Ben and Jerry's to put the strategy into practice in a way that suits the individual brand, while supporting the company's overall sustainability mission. </p>

<p>Ultimately, social media is just a communication tool like any other. But it is one consumers use to talk about brands, and the world is listening. It is easy to fear the tide of social media for the risks it can bring, but this onslaught of information can also be viewed as an opportunity. By listening to those early whispers of complaint, companies can act quickly to minimize the fallout &#8212; while also gaining important knowledge that can inform and improve a company's internal CSR report. </p>

      <p>UX, as user experience is known, is <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/01/scaling_your_ux_strategy.html">the new black in business culture</a>. Most of the executives I meet with, regardless of their industry, now promote UX as key to their product strategy. That's a big change from only five years ago, when UX wasn't on anyone's radar outside the tech world. For a designer like myself, it's easy to recognize which executives know their products intimately, and which manage from a spreadsheet. Thankfully, I'm seeing the emergence of a new generation of UX-oriented leaders with little patience for the hands-off approach. They recognize that as UX eclipses traditional brand marketing, they need to be more hands-on with their products.</p>

<p><strong>The CEO as Lead Product Designer</strong></p>

<p>Steve Jobs famously ushered in an era of the CEO as "Lead Product Designer," <a href="http://inventor-labs.com/blog/2011/10/12/what-its-really-like-working-with-steve-jobs.html">as described by one of his close collaborators, Glenn Reid</a>, who worked with Jobs at NeXT and Apple: <em>"(Steve) told me once that part of the reason he wanted to be CEO was so that nobody could tell him that he wasn't allowed to participate in the nitty-gritty of product design. He was right there in the middle of it. All of it."</em></p>

<p>Given Apple's success, it is not surprising to see many executives following Jobs' lead. I recently met a top executive at a major enterprise technology firm who runs an $8 billion dollar product line and describes himself as the "Chief Product Designer" for his division (even though his title is SVP and General Manager, and he has never before considered himself a "designer"). A few years ago, this characterization would have seemed like a step down for a senior executive. The nitty-gritty of product design has become a badge of pride in many organizations, like Facebook, which has embraced a <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/03/inside_facebooks_internal_inno.html">"learn by making" executive culture</a>.</p>

<p>This product-centric mindset is not entirely new. The auto industry invented the blockbuster product "reveal" long before Jobs, with auto execs unveiling new "concept cars" at auto shows in an annual ritual of one-upmanship that continues today. For example, the now ubiquitous and much beloved Fiat 500 was first unveiled by Sergio Marchionne, no stranger to showmanship, at the Geneva Motorshow in 2004 following the buzz generated by the 2001 re-launch of the Mini-Cooper by BMW. This spirit is exemplified by executives like Akio Toyoda, the CEO of Toyota, who worked his way up the through the ranks from the assembly line. In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/business/worldbusiness/22toyotaside.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">2008 <em>New York Times</em> interview</a>, he said, <em>"If I am going to be at the top of the car company, I want to be the owner-chef &#8212; with knowledge not just of its vehicles but their ingredients. I taste my car, and if it tastes good, I provide it to the customer."</em>  As Toyota CEO, Mr. Toyoda has lived up to his word, <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Toyota_Crown_2013_Megaweb.jpg">launching the radically redesigned Toyota Crown last year</a> in a hot pink bubble gum hue that you could practically taste. </p>

<p>With consumer technology becoming such a status symbol in our culture, tech CEOs must put on a few good UX demos each year to reaffirm the connection to their products, or risk losing face with their peers and seeing their stock price plummet. This is a good first step, but it won't make corporate culture more sensitive to UX. For that, CEOs must move beyond showmanship.</p>

<p>Some CEOs do get UX. They use their products on a daily basis. I recently met a senior executive of a financial services company who is so obsessed with his corporation's product experience that he calls customer service with a new complaint each day, just to make sure the customer service representatives know their way around his product offering. </p>

<p><strong>"Customers" Have Become "Users"</strong></p>

<p>The opposite problem for some executives is that they can be too close to customers (for instance, IT managers who buy a solution) without understanding end-users (the people who actually use the solution on a daily basis) They get so much feedback from their sales teams that it leads to feature creep &#8212; adding features to satisfy every customer. Along the way, any semblance of a coherent user experience is lost. The result: a highly-reactive product development culture in which extra features are continuously bolted on, making the company vulnerable to more pro-active competitors who have a laser-like focus on UX, which can be a potent disruptor in many industries.</p>

<p>So, how do you know if your UX is actually working for your end-users?  Start by conducting a UX audit that captures the sequence of interactions your customers need to take to complete basic tasks with key products, be it renting a car or checking into a hotel room. Most executive flinch when presented with stark visual evidence of the convoluted nature of their user experience. </p>

<p>Here is an example of the sort of visual audit that usually turns heads with executives. This map provides a concrete picture of each step that is required to complete a simple task, in this case installing a home router for an IP telephony company (this map was created in 2005 and does not in any way represent the current state of their products and services). The map is divided into three key stages in the "Out of Box Experience": purchase and open, explore and setup, use and grow. We developed this map after observing a small set of novice users try to complete the process. We used quotes and anecdotes from these sessions to help make the case with executives for the need to overhaul the entire user experience around install, and not just redesign the physical router itself.

<p><strong>The Next Wave</strong></p>

<p>The gap is growing between traditional sales-and-marketing-driven behemoths with their "customer-centric" approach and the new breed of organizations like Square and Zipcar, who have a "UX-centric" culture.  Tomorrow's leaders need to be able to close this gap. Fortunately, there is a great training ground for new UX leadership: the startup market. MBAs and other aspiring professionals are seizing the opportunity to create something new, emulating start-up heroes like Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey and Dennis Crowley. Not all of these startups will succeed, but leaders who join their ranks will learn valuable lessons seeing products and ideas rejected by end-users firsthand. These new UX-minded executives will take top jobs elsewhere, seeding a new UX culture in corporate America.  And they'll certainly be looking to join companies that "get" UX. </p>

<p>But what if you can't jump ship and join a start-up to learn UX skills? Many organizations are developing strategies to increase their UX capacity and promote product-centric entrepreneurship. Some large corporations, like Comcast, have launched venture investing arms. Others, like Google Ventures, are seeing these activities as more than just a way to make money, and rather as a way to engage the UX community. <a href="http://www.designstaff.org/">Design Staff</a>, Google Venture's fantastic blog, has become an online hub for sharing lean UX methodologies. Similarly, organizations like GE are investing in innovation accelerators that pair product teams with outside experts (like Eric Ries, author of Lean Startup) to coach teams in launching new initiatives with a more entrepreneurial mindset. (We can only hope that this UX mindset migrates to Crotonville, GE's vaunted leadership academy.)

      <p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=storytelling+in+business&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=8pO5Uex-r6rgA_HpgOAE&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=1682&bih=557"target="_blank">Discussions about story and storytelling</a> are pretty fashionable in marketing circles. I have ambivalent feelings about this. On the one hand, as a lifelong advocate for the power of story in business, I find this very encouraging. For all companies, having a story and knowing that story are crucial steps to achieving success. On the other hand, I'm worried that too many marketers think that telling their story through advertising is enough. It's not.</p>

<p>In fact, those that think this way do so at their own risk because there is a new kind of company on the rise that uses story in a more powerful way &#8212; and they run more efficient and profitable businesses as a result. </p>

<p>In my new book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/True-Story-Combine-Transform-Business/dp/1422170683/"target="_blank">True Story: How to Combine Story and Action to Transform Your Business</a></em>, I call these new companies story<em>doing</em> companies because they advance their narrative through action, not communication. Storydoing companies &#8212; Red Bull, TOMS shoes, Warby Parker, and Tory Burch, for example &#8212; emphasize the creation of compelling and useful experiences &#8212; new products, new services, and new tools that advance their narrative by lighting up the medium of people. What I mean by this is that when people encounter a storydoing company they often want to tell all their friends about it. Storydoing companies create fierce loyalty and evangelism in their customers. Their stories are told primarily via word of mouth, and are amplified by social media tools.  </p>

<p>So how do you know a storydoing company when you see one? These are the primary characteristics:  </p>

<ol>
	<li>They have a story</li>
	<li>The story is about a larger ambition to make the world or people's lives better</li>
	<li>The story is understood and cared about by senior leadership outside of marketing</li>
	<li>That story is being used to drive tangible action throughout the company: product development, HR policies, compensation, etc.</li>
	<li>These actions add back up to a cohesive whole</li>
	<li>Customers and partners are motivated to engage with the story and are actively using it to advance their own stories</li>
	</ol>

<p>Recently, my partners and I at <a href="http://www.cocollective.com/"target="_blank">co:collective</a> initiated a project to determine whether there is hard statistical evidence that storydoing companies are achieving superior results. We also wanted to create a <a href="http://storydoing.com/tool"target="_blank">tool</a> that allows CEOs and other senior leaders to apply these criteria to an analysis of their own company.  </p>

<p>One of the difficulties we encountered is many of the best examples of storydoing are privately-held companies, so the data on their financial performance is not publicly available.  </p>

<p>So we chose <a href="http://storydoing.com/methodology"target="_blank">42 publicly-traded companies</a>. This list spans seven business categories: retail, entertainment, food and beverage, electronic payments, consumer electronics, airlines, and IT services/products. Since storytelling companies outnumber storydoing companies, in each of the seven categories we chose five storytelling companies and one storydoing company based on the criteria we described above. The storydoing companies are Target, Walt Disney, Starbucks, American Express, Apple, Jet Blue, and IBM. More detail on the full methodology can be found here.</p>

<p>The early results we are seeing are quite compelling. As we expected, storydoing companies are generating a substantially greater number of mentions in social media:</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-1.gif"><img alt="Storydoing Chart 1" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-1-thumb-365x365-4467.gif" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
Those mentions are also more positive:</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-2.gif"><img alt="Storydoing Chart 2" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-2-thumb-365x268-4469.gif"  class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
This ability to light up the medium of people in a positive way allows storydoing companies to spend substantially less money on paid media per dollar of revenue: </p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-3.gif"><img alt="Storydoing Chart 3" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-3-thumb-365x365-4471.gif"  class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
And they wring more value out of that spend in the number of mentions in social media per dollar spent:</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-4.gif"><img alt="Storydoing Chart 4" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-4-thumb-207x329-4477.gif"  class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
As a result, storydoing companies are growing faster than their storytelling counterparts in revenue:</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-5.gif"><img alt="Storydoing 5" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-5-thumb-200x312-4473.gif" width="200" height="312" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
...and share price:</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-6.gif"><img alt="Storydoing Chart 6" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-6-thumb-200x399-4480.gif" width="200" height="399" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
One interesting side note is that it seems like the market hasn't recognized the structural advantage that storydoing companies have over their storytelling counterparts. Their superior results are not yet reflected in P/E ratios:</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/storydoing-7.gif"><img alt="Storydoing Chart 7" src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/storydoing-7-thumb-200x410-4482.gif"  class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p><br />
This is only a start to our research, and we can only imagine that adding some of the privately owned companies for which we're missing financial data would yield even better results than those reported here. Whether that turns out to be true or not, time will tell. But based on the evidence we have to date, our conclusion is that storydoing companies are on to something very compelling. CEOs who seek to deliver better financial results to their shareholders would do well to take heed.  </p>

<p><br />
<em>In the spirit of collaboration and improvement <a href="http://storydoing.com/conversation"target="_blank">we would like to invite</a> anyone to help advance this thinking, by challenging our results to date, making suggestions to improve the methodology, or adding to the data set with data of their own. We think that over time the data set itself can become a valuable public source of inspiration and evidence for agents of change to begin to apply the principles of storydoing inside their own companies.</em>  <br />

      <p>Remember <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnCuwpnwscE">the scene</a> in the first <em>Austin Powers</em> film where Powers, attempting to escape in a steamroller, warns one of Dr. Evil's henchmen to move out of its path?  Despite its comically slow speed &#8212; and a huge distance between them, the guard stays rooted to the spot, yelling <em>Stop!</em> ... until it's too late. (The scene dissolves to his Donna Reed-like wife getting the news and noting tragically: "People never think how things affect the family of a henchman.")</p>

<p>On the industrial stage, something like that scene plays out all too often. A company finds itself in the path of an unstoppable industry disruption, can hardly fail to see it, yet simply fails to act. Only, it's not at all funny.</p>

<p>Consider the pharmaceutical industry, the focus of a <a href="http://fuld.sites.hubspot.com/boiling-the-frog-2013-white-paper-fuld-and-company?hsCtaTracking=6f2cd935-25b7-4173-b1d7-aa9f15d5377d%7C148574c3-32ce-47d6-80d6-255f7a6d74a9">recent global survey</a> my colleagues and I conducted. We asked nearly 200 life sciences executives about long-term trends that posed fundamental threats to their businesses and how management was dealing with them. Despite the fact that all were able to foresee developments unfolding over the coming decade with the power to irreparably damage their companies, 76 percent of the European respondents and 81 percent of the American ones said their companies had made no significant changes to strategy to counter those threats. (Executives representing Asia-Pacific life sciences companies were more sanguine, with 56 percent indicating their firms had prepared for an industry shock).  </p>

<p>In the face of knowable threats, is your own company making more than a futile effort to cry Stop? If you fear not, here are the suggestions we're sharing with the industry leaders we serve: </p>

<p><strong>Inject a steady flow of timely information and (sometimes harsh) outside perspectives into your strategic thinking. </strong>This means fresh information heard on the street, not just more searches on Google, and the use of outside experts to identify oncoming threats that they see and you don't. I've seen this work wonders for a number of companies that want neutral, unvarnished views of their competitive position.  A large pharmaceutical firm, for example, was about to make a big bet on a new class of drugs. But a panel of outside experts that had been assembled to critique the strategy warned management about an emerging risk. Citing early warning signals that were not being emphasized by the scores of industry newsletters and Wall Street analysts, it saved the company from the move that a competitor subsequently took &#8212; to its detriment.</p>

<p><strong>Develop scenarios of how the world might look five or ten years from now.  </strong>No one can predict the future, but by combining known trends in various ways it is possible to anticipate multiple possibilities &#8212; likely story lines about shapes the market could take &#8212; for good or ill. The few companies that have mastered this discipline have benefited mightily. A decade ago Oracle developed a series of scenarios that anticipated massive industry consolidation. Instead of waiting to be steamrolled, the company acted on this intelligence and went on a ten-year acquisition binge, acquiring over 90 companies from 2003 to the present at a pace surpassed only by Google. The result: Oracle became one of the most successful companies in back office database products and tools and has now moved onto advancing in the next market, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2013/07/11/cloud-computing-market-may-become-an-oligopoly-of-high-volume-vendors/">the cloud</a>.  <br />
 <br />
<strong>Experience threats through war games.</strong> There is no substitute for feeling and "touching" the disruption before it arrives. War games translate arguments and assumptions about the future into a tangible setting, allowing rival contestants to play out roles and experience risks. A successful war game can anticipate the moves of market players with an uncanny degree of accuracy. Multinationals have used war games to align strategy in global markets, where regulations and competitors differ. In a number of instances, I have seen war games acknowledge the threat from changing government regulation, informing the company that it must proactively work with authorities to help moderate new regulations, which in turn softened or averted the disruption altogether.</p>

<p><strong>Set trip wires for action. </strong> War games and scenarios should provide you with threads that you can track in order to determine which future world is emerging. You can spot these signals far enough in advance to change strategic direction &#8212; but you must regard them as imperatives to make timely decisions and to act on them.</p>

<p>Preparing for a future industry shock and anticipating its direction is all about honest, steady collection of intelligence and the readiness to alter your plans based on what you have learned. Plenty of executives lose sleep over approaching disruptions; a few vocally oppose them. Neither response will move you out of a steamroller's path. To survive, you'll need to watch, reexamine your position, make tough decisions, and take timely action.  <br />

      <p>On April 1 of this year, the Department of Defense <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/reuvencohen/2013/04/08/u-s-navy-issues-new-cloud-computing-policy/">announced</a> that the US Navy would embark on a strategy to migrate its services to the cloud.  While there have been numerous cases of big and small companies making this leap over the past few months, this one struck a particular chord with me because of its sheer scope.  The US Navy is an organization utilizing 1,400 systems and 7,000 applications to serve more than <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/nav_legacy.asp?id=146">500,000</a> employees.  My company, which is approximately .017%, .019% and .00028% the size of the USN in relative scope, made the transition years ago and it was no small effort taking almost 3 years to fully make the transition.</p>

<p>While the USN is relatively mum about its specific strategies, there are <a href="http://www.doncio.navy.mil/ContentView.aspx?id=4695">references</a> to the fact that they intend to cut their systems in half within 36 months, reducing some overhead cost and modernizing. This is similar to the <a href="http://fcw.com/articles/2013/03/18/amazon-cia-cloud.aspx">approach</a> that the CIA has undertaken in moving much of its infrastructure to Amazon Web Services.  These transitions, even when scaled down to a company of 140 like mine, require a substantial amount of planning, commitment, resources and time with little room for error.  So it comes as no surprise that whenever I spend time with industry peers who have yet to move to the cloud, there is a palpable sense of fear and overwhelming anxiety about how to even think about the process.  </p>

<p>When I'm asked to advise people on how they might craft strategies to get to the cloud, I give a four-point overview based on my own experience. It will get you to the starting line, but beyond that each and every strategy will be different depending on a myriad of circumstances in your corporation.</p>

<p><strong>Move only what you have to and start fresh wherever possible</strong><br />
The first thing is to dispatch with the idea that you are going to "move" all of your current resources into the cloud.  That is just not possible, especially if you have invested heavily in distributed enterprise class systems and the infrastructure to support them.  While it is certainly likely that a good portion of your environment can be virtualized and moved into a Platform as a Service (PaaS)/Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment like Amazon Web Services, the move to the cloud should be viewed as an opportunity to leave systems behind and replace them with systems that are lighter, faster and less expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Tear down and rebuild your security model</strong><br />
If your Microsoft SysAdmin has convinced you that Active Directory is a viable solution for the cloud, or that because you use Active Directory you can only get into the cloud by sticking with solutions that support Active Director (AD)/Windows Azure Active Directory (WAAD), you need to get a second opinion.  When moving to the cloud you have to consider that many solutions do not allow for authentication off of Active Directory and instead rely on more common security protocols such as SAML1, SAML2, OID and OAuth.  Identity Access Management (IAM) vendors have been forced to consider brokering authentication for Active Directory because companies feel like they must stay on it as an internal authentication platform.  Nothing could be further from the truth and if you do your research, you will discover that there is a wealth of options out there.  To get into the cloud you need the most robust and extensible authentication model you can possibly build and by doing so your <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V77F2mCMpX9oFyFHIgpoOD4hip0IZn88AYohMC0oqrU/edit">options for solutions</a> will increase exponentially.</p>

<p><strong>Cost savings are a benefit, not a driver</strong><br />
If you think that you need to get into the cloud to save money, you need to think again.  Yes, you will ultimately save money by migrating to the cloud, lots of money in fact, but it takes time to get there and there is the chance that you will actually spend more money upfront. When making your pitch to senior management, talk about the benefits of reduced infrastructure, resources, better uptime, business continuity enhancements, mobility and access ubiquity.  If asked about cost savings, be ready to deliver your pitch on how you intend to reduce or eliminate capex spending, reduce personnel resources, move services to a pay by month model eliminating long term contracts and ultimately reduce your annual budget by a modest percentage year over year over a 3-5 year period of time.  Do not get caught in the trap of making cost savings one of your drivers for going into the cloud.  You will bring a level of scrutiny over your claims, on which you will most likely be unable to deliver.</p>

<p><strong>Create a long-term flexible strategy</strong><br />
The last bit of wisdom is to develop the most thorough 1-, 3- and 5-year cloud strategy that you can put down.  My 1-year strategy is very specific; my 3-year is slightly less specific because I find that even 3 years down the road is very hard to see.  It's impossible to see five years in the future, but if you work backwards from 5 years you can, even at a very amorphous level, describe how you would want your environment to look at that point. These should be rolling strategies that are flexible enough to consider the dynamics of the industries you will operate in.  Today's Identity Access Management vendor will be tomorrow's Mobile Device Management (MDM) vendor and a week from now, could be bought by a company in some entirely different vertical.  By creating a flexible strategy, you can constantly adapt to these changing conditions in the industry over which you have almost no control.</p>

<p>In considering these four concepts, keep in mind that they are applicable to any size organization and any cloud scope transformation.  The more I have considered them, the more I have realized that they are applicable anywhere.  It's no small task, but you can move your company into the cloud if you approach things with a new mind and put aside the technologies of the past.</p>

<p>One last thing to note...in the next five years, new employees coming into your company won't know (or care) how to use Outlook or mapped drives.  They won't care for your PC laptop offering or why your firewall blocks Dropbox.  They will have established methods for doing work and they will all involve the cloud. Seventy-five out of the top 100 universities in the latest <em>US News and World Report</em> college rankings use Google Apps as their primary backbone.  Seven of the 8 Ivies are in the same boat.  Do you really want to be the last one at the starting line?</p>

      <p>I want to make one thing perfectly clear: this blog post is not an attack on the U.S., and my message is not anti-American. I have lived in the U.S. on and off for almost 12 years. I went to college in Boston (Berklee), my kids are both U.S. citizens as well as German citizens, and we have deep admiration for many American customs, traits, people and places.</p>

<p>But ever since 9/11, the U.S. government seems to have gone down a (until recently) secret path towards some kind of 'digital totalitarianism', with increasing disregard for other countries' mindsets and cultures. </p>

<p>The latest developments around PRISM and the NSA dragnet operations uncovered by Edward Snowden, in my view, severely damage the fragile fabric of the new global ecosystem, which we so sorely rely on in order to collectively tackle truly urgent global issues such as energy, pollution, food, climate change, (cyber-)terrorism and inequality.</p>

<p>Yes, of course, as more details about the NSA's mass surveillance activities are coming to light, it is also becoming clear that at least the other intelligence tribe members of UKUSA &#8212; i.e. the '5 Eyes' group (the U.S., the U.K., New Zealand, Australia, Canada) are pretty much doing the same thing, with Germany and France not far behind.  But still: at the heart of this global collusion to hoover up every bit of information about hundreds of millions of citizens under the pretense of fighting crime and terrorism sits the U.S. government, so let me start there.</p>

<p>The past few weeks have been game-changing for the U.S./Europe relationship, with the EU Commission already hinting at moving cloud computing centers to Europe, many parliamentarians proposing to review international trade agreements and data exchange practices, and German chancellor Merkel heading towards a pre-election show-down on these very issues. It is not actually the fact that surveillance is real that scares Europeans, it is that now, everyone apparently is a legitimate target &#8212; yes we scan, because we can!</p>

<p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/12/eu-to-usa-wtf-is-prism/">Little is being done</a> by the U.S. government to address Europe's concerns, and most Americans seem to consider this whole affair a non-issue. (Granted, this sentiment may be <a href="http://rt.com/usa/snowden-americans-majority-poll-906/">softening a bit</a>.) See the charts below:</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/snowdensupport-4461.html" onclick="window.open('http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/snowdensupport-4461.html','popup','width=365,height=318,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/assets_c/2013/07/snowdensupport-thumb-365x318-4461.gif" width="365" height="318" alt="snowdensupport.gif" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>But, it is a big deal.  And more people need to understand just how big.</p>

<p>For context, let's go back to 1788 and take a look at the words of James Madison, fourth president of the United States:</p>

<blockquote> "There are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations."</blockquote>

<p>The utter disrespect with which U.S. law enforcement agencies have violated the most basic international agreements on data security, basic citizens' rights and even diplomatic immunity is very worrisome, and will soon force people around the globe to rethink our relationship with 'all things USA' &#8212; whether it's President Obama and the U.S. government, or U.S.-based telecoms, technology companies and internet platforms such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Yahoo and even Dropbox.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, President Obama seems happy to preside over this Orwellian affair with a newfound disregard for the basic privacy rights of citizens, which he previously expressed with great vigor back in 2005 and 2007, when he was still just a senator (watch these <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/08/us/politics/08obama-surveillance-history-video.html?loadDynamically=false&commentsPosition=left&_r=1&">NYT videos</a>). This is incredible &#8212;  life is indeed stranger than fiction!</p>

<p>Let's be clear about this: for Europeans, in particular, the American shift towards state-sanctioned 'data totalitarianism' will have significant impact on whether we will do business with U.S.-based companies that are in technology, media, cloud computing, social networking, telecommunications, e-commerce or 'big data', for they seemingly cannot do anything else than comply with the laws &#8212; and their extreme interpretations &#8212; as they are now (i.e. the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act">Patriot Act</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Court">FISA courts</a>, etc). </p>

<p>Therefore, some 50-75% of the worlds' largest digital communications and technology enterprises are now facing a seriously wicked dilemma: do they comply with FISA orders or do they protect their users (half of which are not even U.S. citizens)?</p>

<p>The bottom line is that currently all non-U.S. citizens seem to have no real protection, no recourse, no oversight... no power, and no rights. This is totally and utterly unacceptable and cannot be swept under the rug as 'business as usual'. </p>

<p>Sure, variations of the same plots are happening in China and in Russia, but who would have thought that the formerly alleged bastion of liberty and freedom, the United States of America, would resort to these sorts of global dragnet activities?  This is wrong and that's all there is to it.</p>

<p>I believe that if this situation is not resolved very soon, non-U.S. internet users will be left with pretty much one option: some kind of a boycott or 'strike' &#8212; i.e. the explicit non-participation in those platforms and services that are subject to the totalitarian application of laws such as the U.S. Patriot Act. </p>

<p>The future of U.S.-based technology companies is at stake here, as is the future of U.S./EU relationships.</p>

<p>To remedy the situation, the leading U.S. internet and technology companies, led by Apple, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Facebook need to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Unequivocally side with their real stakeholders &#8212;  i.e. their users &#8212; and specifically assure us Europeans that they will act on our behalf, and seek to protect us against the abuse that has surfaced in the past few weeks.</li>
	<li>Mount a strong campaign to urge President Obama and the U.S. Congress to stop these global mass surveillance activities, immediately, and put appropriate approval, remedy and redress mechanisms in place that are more in line with EU provisions, i.e. requiring actual cause for data surveillance activities, needing individual warrants, and informing the public on what the procedure is.</li>
	<li>Urge the government to agree to a public trial of Edward Snowden that could take place in a neutral location such as at the International Court of Justice in the Hague.</li>
</ol>

<p>The U.S. government needs to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Acknowledge the mistakes and rights violations that have occurred as far as the mass surveillance of global citizens are concerned, and uncover all additional instances. Dismissing the Director of National Intelligence (James Clapper) seems like another plausible step towards resolution, as well, given the fact that he pretty much lied to Congress.</li>
	<li>Immediately discontinue the practice of spying on global citizens without individual warrants, and only in strict congruence with international laws and regulations.</li>
	<li>Agree to a fair, public and open trial of Edward Snowden (see above).</li>
</ol>

<p>If no action along these lines is taken, I think that the international community and hereto faithful users of American technologies and internet platforms will have no choice but to consider taking serious and possibly quite dramatic action to safeguard against this 'totalitarian surveillance creep'.</p>

<p>Some such actions for the international community may include:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Temporarily halting the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52010DC0385:EN:NOT">EU-US data exchange programs for travelers (PNR and TFTP)</a>, which could potentially lead to a significant disruption of commercial air traffic between the U.S. and Europe (the review was already scheduled before the Snowden affair and is already in progress at the Commission).</li>
	<li>Cut or significantly reduce ties with U.S.-based internet portals and service providers and shift business to providers based in other countries that are subject to international laws and explicit supervision (i.e. that can guarantee that appropriate processes and safeguards are in place). By extension, this would also concern the rest of the "5 Eyes" group, i.e. the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. </li>
	<li>Pause or even halt the current <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Free_Trade_Area">Trans-Atlantic Free Trade Agreement</a> discussions until these demands, above, are met. Yes, I know, this could be quite painful for some EU countries but ... would they rather be 'collateral damage' now or take collective action to address potential long-term issues?</li>
	<li>Open or expand cloud computing facilities in Europe (Luxembourg and Switzerland seem like good locations) and around the world. Until now, the U.S.-based providers have dominated the global cloud business because of faster innovation and much larger investments in this sector &#8212;  Europe needs to catch up urgently. </li>
	<li>As global consumers, we just may need to stop using all U.S.-based services that won't voluntarily comply with international standards of data protection.</li>
	<li>Offer a United Nations-supervised trial location and some kind of asylum to Edward Snowden, perhaps in the EU.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a game-changing moment, and it's time for global citizens to act. America: we love you, but enough is enough!</p>

      <p>For many, a corporate directorship is a career capstone. But attaining one is far from easy. No one can say for sure how to get on a corporate board, but many people point to two routes: the first is to break into the "right" network and the second is to seek a progression of board seats that begins with, for example, a seat on a not-for-profit or community board and eventually results in appointment to a corporate board. </p>

<p>Both paths are problematic &#8212; neither is particularly transparent or relies on objective measures and given that many boards are stubborn bastions of white masculinity, pursuing the "right" network can be fraught, especially for women and other diverse candidates. Indeed, <a href="http://hbr.org/2013/06/dysfunction-in-the-boardroom/ar/1">our research</a> reinforces that concern: many boards still rely on their own (mostly white, mostly male) networks to fill seats. </p>

<p>There's a different way &#8212; one that is more measurable, controllable and offers greater transparency. It starts with a focus on skills. Although many boards continue to select new members from their own networks, our research suggests that more are beginning to implement objective processes to select members based on the skills and attributes that boards need to be effective. Our 2012 survey, in partnership with WomenCorporateDirectors and Heidrick & Struggles, of more than 1,000 corporate directors across the globe, found that only 48% of the boards had a formal process of determining the combination of skills and attributes required for their board and, therefore, for new directors </p>

<p>We know this approach can work because we've seen it: We studied a large corporation that was being split into two public companies for which two new boards had to be created. The chairman wanted to create two balanced boards, with the mix of skills, knowledge, and experience each company needed. He appointed a special team to create an objective, transparent method for selecting the directors. After reviewing the roles and responsibilities of each board and the natures of the new businesses, the team derived lists of the skills each board needed. Then it created a model containing the dimensions critical to a high-performing board, from functional and industry expertise to behavioral attributes. This approach led both companies to recruit board members that were diverse in needed strategic skills. Both boards are on to a good start &#8212; demonstrating that when a firm builds a board using a rigorous assessment of the qualities it needs to carry out its governance task, rather than personal networks, the board is better equipped to execute its functions. </p>

<p>In our survey, we also asked about specific skills. We wanted to know which were the strongest skills represented on boards and which were missing. Directors named industry knowledge, strategy, and financial-audit expertise as their strongest skill sets.</p>

<p><br />
And 43% cited technology expertise, HR-talent management, international-global expertise, and succession planning as the skills missing most on their boards.<br />

<p><br />
We also looked at results by industry and region. The industry with the greatest skills gap was IT & telecommunications, whose boards are in serious need of international-global expertise and HR-talent management. </p>

<p><br />
The region with the greatest board-level skills gap is Asia, where risk management and M&A adeptness are sorely needed.</p>

<p><br />
Based on our research and experience with boards, we believe that the future of director selection is becoming increasingly objective and skill-focused process. Networks aren't going away, but aspiring directors may want to approach their search by asking not only, "what skills do I need to get on a board?," but also by looking at what skills boards already possess and what skills boards need. One strategy might be investing in your own human capital to become the board member corporations need.</p>

<p><small><strong>Methodology</strong><br />
<em>We surveyed more than 1,000 board members in 59 countries. (U.S. boards made up 37% of the sample while 62% of boards represented were from outside of the U.S.) We analyzed the data along several dimensions including geography and industry. Specifically, we did a geographical breakout by eight major world regions: Asia; Africa; Australia and New Zealand; Eastern Europe & Russia; Latin America; the Middle East; North America; and Western Europe (due to low sample size or domination by one or few countries in a region we have excluded three regions, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, from our findings).</p>

<p>The industry breakout was done using eight major sectors (similar to those in the Global Industry Classification Standard system): Consumer Discretionary (e.g., consumer durables & apparel, retailing, education, media, hotels, restaurants & leisure); Consumer Staples (e.g., food, beverage & tobacco, household and personal products); Energy & Utilities (e.g., oil, gas & consumable fuels, electric, gas and water utilities); Financials (e.g., banking & financial services, insurance, real estate); Health Care (e.g., pharmaceuticals, biotechnology & life sciences, health care equipment and services); Industrials (e.g., aerospace & defense, construction & engineering, industrial conglomerates, professional services, textiles); IT & Telecommunications (e.g., computers & peripherals, electronic equipment & components, semiconductors, wireless telecommunication services); and Materials (e.g., chemicals, metals & mining, paper & forest products). </p>

<p>The following multiple choice list of 14 skills was used in the survey: Compensation; Evaluation-Assessment; Financial-audit; HR-Talent management; Industry knowledge; International-Global; M&A; Operations; Regulatory, legal and compliance knowledge; Risk management; Sales & Marketing; Strategy; Succession Planning; and Technology. Participants were asked to choose one (or a write-in option of "other") for the strongest skill set or area of expertise that they brought to the board. They could choose as many as applied for skill sets or areas of expertise missing from the board (including a write-in option of "other"). </em></small></p>

      <p>In a war-game simulation, newly formed teams whose leaders encouraged collaborative decisions were at first quickly surpassed by groups with "directive" leaders. But the "empowered" teams learned more rapidly, and by the end of the simulation, they had bested the other teams by about <strong>20%</strong> of total points scored, says a research group led by Natalia M. Lorinkova of Wayne State University. Why do empowered teams get off to a slow start? At first, members go through a period of role identification, creating what may be inevitable early performance delays, the researchers suggest.</p>

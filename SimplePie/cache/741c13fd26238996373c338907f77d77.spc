<p>I've spent most of my life saying &quot;yes&quot; to things because, I have to admit, I am a natural people pleaser. I want to make everyone happy, and when others are happy, that makes me feel good, too. On occasions when I'm forced to say or do something that will displease someone else, I easily get stressed out. (See also: <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-get-what-you-want-on-customer-service-calls" target="_blank">How to Get What You Want on Customer Service Calls</a>)</p>
<p>For most of my life, this wasn't much of an issue, because I could easily rearrange my schedule and do a friend a favor without too much inconvenience to myself or to others around me. That all changed, however, once I got married and had a child. Suddenly, I had to put my daughter first, even if that meant displeasing other well-meaning relatives and friends.</p>
<p>I had to learn to say &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of the time, I discovered that saying no wasn't as difficult as I thought. Most of my friends understood my circumstances, and thought no more of it. However, there remained a few people who just didn't understand why my daughter needs to be in bed no later than eight, or who assumed that because I work from home, I was free to run random errands for them during the day. There were still people who refused to take no for an answer, or who simply took my refusal personally. For those people, I needed (and still need) to be both firmer and more diplomatic in saying no.</p>
<p>Here's what I've learned about saying &quot;no&quot; so far.</p>
<h2>1. Honesty Is the Best Policy</h2>
<p>Sometimes I dread saying no to a friend who is notorious for not taking no for an answer. However, I'm often pleasantly surprised when I honestly tell them my reasons for saying no. &quot;I just can't afford to go there,&quot; or &quot;Honestly, it's just going to be too stressful for me to drive that far with the baby,&quot; are two responses that I've used successfully and I've found that the other person usually <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-get-and-give-honest-feedback" target="_blank">appreciates the frankness</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Delay Commitment</h2>
<p>This idea might sound like a bad date movie, but sometimes it's a good idea to equivocate and to delay committing to something. Perhaps, like me, you tend to say yes when you're put on the spot (or as I like to put it, when I've been ambushed). I find it helpful to say, &quot;Let me check my schedule (or with my significant other) and get back to you,&quot; or simply, &quot;I may have a commitment that day, so let me get back to you.&quot; Later, once you've thought about it, phone or send a succinct note stating a firm but polite no.</p>
<h2>3. You're Not the Best Person for the Job</h2>
<p>If a friend asks you to do something that's out of your comfort zone, you can be honest that you're not comfortable doing it and that someone else might do a better job. &quot;I'm honestly not that great with kids. Why don't you ask another friend to babysit instead?&quot; Or, &quot;If I were on <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/small-business/finding-community-leadership-opportunities" target="_blank">that committee</a>, I wouldn't be able to give the issues the time and attention they deserve.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, this response invites argumentation (&quot;Oh you hardly have to do anything! Just put a movie on!&quot;), so it may take a bit more explaining to convince the asker (especially those who don't take no for an answer) that you're serious.</p>
<h2>4. Show Your Appreciation</h2>
<p>Some people take your refusal as a rejection of them personally. Show them that you like and appreciate them, but that you simply can't comply with their request.</p>
<p>For example, if you hate the thought of going to a poetry reading, but wouldn't mind spending time with your friend elsewhere, <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/47-cheap-fun-things-to-do-this-weekend" target="_blank">suggest lunch on another day instead</a>. If you can't make it to a party, tell your friend how much you like her parties and how you appreciate the effort they put into throwing these get-togethers, but you can't make it this time. Although you may assume that your friend or relative knows how much she means to you, you'd be surprised how much she enjoys hearing you put your appreciation into words.</p>
<h2>5. Keep It Simple</h2>
<p>Sometimes not explaining is more effective than explaining. &quot;No, I'm sorry, I can't make it. I have an appointment.&quot; Or, &quot;I'm afraid it's just not going to work out.&quot; No need to explain further. Most people will respect your privacy enough not to pry. If your friend does get nosy, a simple &quot;I'd rather not get into it,&quot; should suffice to keep further argument at bay. Remember, you're not obligated to explain yourself or to justify your decision. There needs to be some privacy and autonomy left in the world!</p>

<p>Most folks seem to approach home-buying with generally the same logic. It goes something like this &mdash; our first or &quot;starter&quot; home will be a modest bungalow or condo that will serve as our entry into the real estate market. Our second home will probably be located in the suburbs and be much larger to support our growing family. And of course, after the kids are out of the nest, it'll be time to downsize to a small townhouse or home in a 55+ community. Those are three real estate transactions driven half by peer expectations and half by marketing. But is it all necessary? (See also: <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/what-you-need-to-know-before-buying-your-first-home">What You Need to Know Before Buying Your First Home</a>)</p>
<p>My grandparents bought one home 10 years after they were married, and they lived in it until the day they died. Granted, <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/why-this-isnt-your-grandparents-economy">with today's more mobile society</a>, spending 50 years in the same state, let alone the same town and house, is a rarity. But, all else being equal &mdash; are we buying and selling out of need or by suggestion? And, after we pay for movers, finish remodeling, buy new furniture, and pay for closing costs and higher property taxes, are we coming out ahead?</p>
<p>I think there's a better way &mdash; a way to balance changing needs without <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/the-abc-s-of-diy-moving">uprooting ourselves</a> and stressing our budgets. If you're considering buying your first place, why not rethink your approach and choose a starter home that has the potential to be a forever home?</p>
<h2>1. Ask Yourself the Right Questions</h2>
<p>As with any house-hunting project, finding the right place starts with asking the right questions. Understanding your needs now and gauging your future needs is half the battle.</p>
<p><strong>How Much Space Do You Really Need Now?</strong></p>
<p>What are your current space and size priorities? What rooms do you spend the most time in? Are cozy bedrooms okay, but large and spacious kitchens an absolute must? Consider how your lifestyle can <a href="http://money.msn.com/frugal-living/post.aspx?post=27063e75-359a-47f6-b098-0550a0b0dcf8">inform reasonable compromises</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How Much House Will You Need in the Future?</strong></p>
<p>What size of family do you expect to have? Would you like each child to have his own bedroom, or do you think sharing builds stronger bonds between siblings? Is there a chance that you'll be a primary caretaker of a parent or in-law down the road? Review your philosophies and anticipate how probable life changes might affect your needs 10 or 15 years down the road.</p>
<p><strong>How Much Time and Money Can You Devote to Maintenance?</strong></p>
<p>More house typically means more maintenance. What size of a home or yard can you handle and still have time for a little R&amp;R on the weekends? How will the <a href="http://realestate.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=25490855">maintenance costs</a> differ between the homes you're looking at?</p>
<h2>2. House Hunt With an Architect's Eye</h2>
<p>Reworking a home's entire layout can be considerably more expensive than making modest revisions to an existing floor plan. Before you buy, consider a home's orientation. Is there only room to make additions on one end of the house? Would an addition fit into the existing floor plan, or would it require a complete remodel? Are there special design features or historic details that will need to be carried over into the new structure?</p>
<h2>3. Understand the Neighborhood</h2>
<p>Every neighborhood has its <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/do-it-yourself-with-community-help">own unique personality</a> and it's important to respect the aesthetics and the norms of the homes around you. Do you want to be the guy who builds the first four-bedroom, three-car garage on a street filled with quaint pre-war bungalows? How might future plans for your home be received by your neighbors and fit in with the overall look and feel of the street?</p>
<h2>4. Survey the Lot</h2>
<p>Unless you're adding stories, lot size determines how much a home can physically grow to meet your needs. As you house hunt, examine how the home's footprint fits on the lot. Is there space to add another bedroom or bath and still be well within property line limits? How will future expansion affect the flow of the outdoor space? Are there geographic features you'll have to contend with to make future additions?</p>
<h2>5. Review the Codes</h2>
<p>Every municipality has slightly different requirements that limit house size, height, how close you can build to property lines, etc. Some historic neighborhoods even have <a href="http://homebuying.about.com/cs/deedrestrictions/a/restrictions.htm">restrictive covenants</a> that regulate acceptable architectural styles and paint colors. If you want to make sure your starter home can evolve with your family's needs, review the local codes that might directly affect your ability to make changes later.</p>
<p>In the end, finding a home that meets your needs now and is perfectly poised to grow as your family grows, is entirely possible. With realistic expectations, the right planning, and a little creative vision, that quaint starter home can be all you need it to be.</p>

<p>From choice of program, to accumulation strategies, ongoing management, and eventual redemption, there are many tricks to effectively using frequent flyer miles. Here is everything you need to know to become a frequent flyer superstar. (See also: <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/maximize-the-value-of-your-airline-miles-and-points" target="_blank">Maximize the Value of Your Airline Miles and Points</a>)</p>
<h2>Choosing Your Rewards Program</h2>
<p>Before you even choose your weapon (aka mileage programs and strategies), you need to establish the game at hand. Instead of randomly collecting miles for the sake of collecting them, find a reason to earn miles. Is it a business class flight to Europe? A family vacation to Disney? The more focused you are in your intent, the more targeted and effective your accumulation strategies will be.</p>
<p><strong>Programs Galore</strong></p>
<p>Although generally referred to as &quot;frequent flyer miles,&quot; a more accurate term would be &quot;reward miles&quot; or &quot;reward points,&quot; since not only airlines, but hotels, transportation providers, and even grocery stores provide opportunities for accumulating points that can translate into free or discounted travel.</p>
<p><strong>Understand the Alliances</strong></p>
<p>Most major airlines belong to an alliance, which allows for accumulation and redemption of miles with different airlines. Thus, you can accumulate miles with US Airways, and redeem them for flights on Swiss Air. Or you can fly with West Jet, but attribute your miles to American Airlines.</p>
<p>The three major alliances are <a href="http://www.staralliance.com/en/" target="_blank">Star Alliance</a>, <a href="http://www.oneworld.com/member-airlines/" target="_blank">One World</a>, and <a href="http://www.skyteam.com/en/About-us/Our-members/" target="_blank">Sky Team</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Diversify Among Alliances</strong></p>
<p>To maximize your opportunities (without scattering your efforts too much), choose one airline from each alliance as a focal point for accumulation.</p>
<p><strong>Collect Universal Points</strong></p>
<p>There are a few reward miles programs (like <a href="http://www.alaskaair.com/content/mileage-plan.aspx" target="_blank">Alaska Airlines</a> and <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/preferredguest/index.html" target="_blank">SPG</a>) that provide excellent flexibility in allowing you to transfer your points to airlines and hotel programs spread across all the alliances. Look for ways to accumulate miles into one of these types of programs (such as with a credit card &mdash; see below).</p>
<h2>Managing Miles</h2>
<p>This is where we separate the aces from the also-rans, because managing miles is nor for the faint of heart. But all the effort will pay off, especially if you're enjoying a long-haul business class flight for a fraction of the price of an economy ticket.</p>
<p><strong>Organize Yourself</strong></p>
<p>Despite choosing focal points for major accumulation within each of the alliances, you're going to end up having lots of accounts. Signing up for a hotel program and liking them on Facebook for 1,000 points could come in handy down the road when you find a bonus transfer deal.</p>
<p>But this means you'll also have to organize multiple user names, passwords, membership numbers, and track your earnings. Dust off your spreadsheet skills and don't be wary of joining too many programs; you never know when they'll be useful.</p>
<p><strong>Use a Rewards Management Site</strong></p>
<p>Though not a full substitute for the trusty spreadsheet, using a rewards management site can help you get an overview your memberships, find deals, and transfer miles between programs. The three main sites are <a href="http://www.awardwallet.com/" target="_blank">Award Wallet</a>, <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/frequent-flyer-junkie-manage-your-miles-here" target="_blank">Points</a>, and <a href="https://www.usingmiles.com/" target="_blank">Using Miles</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Watch for Expiration</strong></p>
<p>Many programs revoke your miles if your account is inactive for too long. But you can keep them going with as little as a periodic $1 online purchase earning miles to that program. Rewards management sites like those above help you to track your expiration dates so you can earn accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Beware of Transfers and Trades</strong></p>
<p>Although a couple of the programs above allow you to trade miles between users and transfer miles between rewards programs, beware! Most of the time you'll lose too much value per mile for it to be worthwhile. The exception to this rule is with the universal points programs referenced earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Track Your Strategies</strong></p>
<p>When you complete a transaction that earns you miles (be it online shopping, booking a flight, or participating in a promotion), record your activity in your trusty spreadsheet &mdash; and double-check that the miles are deposited to your account. Sometimes you need to contact the rewards program to ensure the correct amount of miles are attributed. They're usually quite nice when you call, but don't trust all transactions to process correctly; be ready to enforce your rights.</p>
<h2>Earning Miles</h2>
<p>Here are some ways and means to earn miles. Combine as many strategies as you can to maximize value!</p>
<p><strong>Don't Reinvent the Wheel</strong></p>
<p>I don't have time to extensively research all programs and opportunities, nor to troll the frequent <a href="http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/index.php" target="_blank">flyer talk forums</a> for deals. As an answer to this, you can enroll in various membership programs such as the <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/the-travel-hacking-cartel-fly-around-the-world-for-almost-free" target="_blank">Travel Hacking Cartel</a>, <a href="http://www.theprofessionalhobo.com/2013/06/financial-travel-tip-83-frequent-flyer-mile-accumulation-for-canadians/" target="_blank">Canadian Freeflyers</a>, <a href="http://www.firstclassflyer.com/" target="_blank">First Class Flyer</a>, and <a href="http://www.theprofessionalhobo.com/2013/06/financial-travel-tip-85-the-ultimate-guide-to-frequent-flyer-miles/" target="_blank">The Ultimate Guide to Frequent Flyer Miles</a> to provide a knowledge base, and deliver new deals to your inbox.</p>
<p><strong>Get a Credit Card (or Two)</strong></p>
<p>I've (cautiously) extolled the <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/top-seven-reasons-why-i-use-my-credit-card-for-everything" target="_blank">virtues of credit cards</a> for years now; the main reason being that they are excellent tools for accumulating miles on every dollar you spend.</p>
<p>Choose a credit card with <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/6-myths-about-using-credit-cards-for-the-sign-up-bonuses" target="_blank">a plush bonus for signing up</a>, and a program that is one of your chosen focal points for accumulation.</p>
<p>Some people apply ruthlessly for credit cards offering sign-up bonuses, then cancel the cards accordingly. Use this strategy with caution (don't overextend your credit, don't get yourself into unnecessary debt, and keep an eye on your credit score); but when done successfully you can earn mega-miles.</p>
<p><strong>Go Shopping</strong></p>
<p>This isn't a carte blanche order. But if you need to buy something (right down to gas and groceries), make sure you're earning for it. Some airline programs have online shopping malls (allowing you to earn various amounts per dollar spent across a huge variety of stores), and <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/love-travel-but-hate-airline-miles-try-amexs-blue-sky-preferred" target="_blank">some credit cards provide bonus miles for purchases</a> in certain retail categories.</p>
<p>Look for retailers offering mileage bonus deals, and pay for the item with your reward miles credit card to maximize your earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Go Flying</strong></p>
<p>Although the end-game is usually to fly for free (or almost free) &mdash; and ideally <a href="http://www.theprofessionalhobo.com/2010/06/my-business-class-travel-adventures-and-using-frequent-flyer-miles/" target="_blank">in business class or higher</a>, sometimes you have to fly somewhere and you don't have the miles to do it.</p>
<p>Or, if you're an eager accumulator, maybe you're interested in doing a &quot;mileage run&quot; and flying a route offering a special mileage deal.</p>
<p>Choose airlines that help you earn miles in one of your focal programs (remember, sometimes you can fly with one airline and earn with another), and sometimes a marginally more expensive flight with an accumulating airline beats out a slightly cheaper flight with a budget airline that earns you no miles.</p>
<p><strong>Remember Hotels</strong></p>
<p>Hotel rewards programs not only offer valuable points and bonuses for staying, but regular promotions that earn you miles without needing to book anything. Some hotel points are also transferrable to airline miles at good value.</p>
<h2>Redeeming Miles</h2>
<p>This is what it's ultimately about. You've earned the miles, and you want to use them for travel.</p>
<p><strong>Remember Hotels (Again)</strong></p>
<p>Using points towards stays can be quite lucrative. Remember to engineer your accumulation strategy towards your desired travel goals. You can earn miles for redemption towards flights and hotels (and even car rentals) to further cut your travel costs.</p>
<p><strong>Don't Get Sidetracked</strong></p>
<p>Some rewards programs offer goods, certificates, and services in exchange for your points. Most of the time, the value per mile is atrocious for these items; just buy the blender for cash &mdash; you'll pay exponentially more for it if you use miles.</p>
<p><strong>Flying for Miles and Cash</strong></p>
<p>If you don't have enough miles for a flight, some airlines allow you to redeem your miles and pay cash to cover the difference. Pay attention to their valuation per mile; sometimes it's worthwhile to pay all cash for this flight and earn miles, using your beefed-up mileage balance for your next flight.</p>
<p><strong>Free Flights Aren't Exactly Free</strong></p>
<p>Even if miles pay for your &quot;full flight&quot;, you're always on the hook for taxes, fees, and various surcharges. These vary by airline, airport, and route. You can minimize these fees with a little comparative digging.</p>
<p><strong>Fly in Style</strong></p>
<p>You get much better valuation on your miles when you fly in business class, and on long-haul flights. (And I must say, <a href="http://www.theprofessionalhobo.com/2010/06/my-business-class-travel-adventures-and-using-frequent-flyer-miles/" target="_blank">business class is addictive</a>.)</p>
<h2>Not in the USA?</h2>
<p>There is much griping amongst non-U.S. residents that the best frequent flyer mile deals are exclusive to the United States. And to a point, it's true.</p>
<p>But all is not lost for those of us in Canada, Europe, and beyond. Canadians can shorten the learning curve with programs like <a href="http://www.canadianfreeflyers.com/" target="_blank">Canadian Free Flyers</a>, and regardless of where you live, there are deals you can participate in. <a href="http://travelhacking.org/" target="_blank">Travel Hacking Cartel</a> founder Chris Guillebeau surmises that at least 50% of the deals he publishes are applicable internationally, and he extends his free flight guarantee to all his readers &mdash; U.S. residents or not.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the TV commercials with people strolling through town or the neighborhood carrying their retirement number? The numbers vary from person to person, but the general range seems to be between $1 million and $2 million. The implied message: &quot;Shame on you if you don't know your 'number'!&quot; (And of course, &quot;Contact us so we can help you figure it out.&quot;) (See also: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wisebread.com/financial-independence-is-more-than-just-a-number?wbref=readmore-1">Financial Independence Is More Than Just a Number</a>)</p>
<p>I like the ads because they focus our attention on a measurable retirement goal. But <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wisebread.com/11-ways-to-prep-for-guerrilla-retirement">what exactly is the goal</a>, and what role does this &quot;number&quot; play?</p>
<h2>Assets? What Assets?</h2>
<p>The number in the ads might represent total assets (the combined value of your house, savings and retirement accounts, and other things of value). Or perhaps it refers to only your investable assets (just the savings and retirement accounts, not the house). Still another possibility is that it represents your net worth (your total assets minus your total liabilities, or debts). Hmmm.</p>
<h2>High Net Worth Is No Guarantee of Financial Independence</h2>
<p>If I were to guess, I'd say it represents your net worth. But here's the problem &mdash; net worth is a measure of your wealth. That's an important measure, but your ultimate goal is really financial independence, and that's measured by monthly income, or cash flow. Let's look at an example to illustrate.</p>
<p>Assume your household has a net worth of $1 million. Congratulations, you're a millionaire! Surely that's enough to retire on, right? Maybe&hellip;or maybe not. It depends on the composition of your net worth.</p>
<p>If, for example you have $2 million in assets but $1 million in liabilities (mortgage, auto, education, and other debt), your net worth is still $1 million. But the cost of carrying so much debt might be, say, $6,000 per month. Despite being a millionaire, can you afford to give up your job and still cover a negative monthly cash flow of $6,000? And we haven't even addressed your other monthly cash flow needs to cover food, clothing, transportation, energy, health care, and other living expenses.</p>
<h2>Cash Flow Is King</h2>
<p>This example is a little extreme, but it illustrates a very real point: Your ultimate goal &mdash; your retirement &quot;number&quot; &mdash; should be measured not by wealth <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wisebread.com/shrinking-your-cash-flow-period-to-create-a-better-budget">but by cash flow</a>. Yes, your wealth contributes to your cash flow, but it's a means towards the end and not the end itself. And as illustrated by the example, there is bad wealth (which generates negative cash flow) as well as good wealth (which creates positive monthly cash flow).</p>
<p>Let's try another example, one that moves us in a more favorable direction. Your household has $1 million in assets and no liabilities. Great &mdash; no negative cash flow from loans. But your house is valued at $600,000 and your total retirement savings is $400,000. If you invest the $400,000 in an account that generates 6% annual interest, that's $24,000 per year or $2,000 per month in positive cash flow. Ah, but the house. While it's mortgage-free, the insurance and property taxes create a regular stream of negative cash flow. And then there are still those nasty cash outlays for living expenses.</p>
<p>OK, you've made some progress but haven't yet reached the promised land of financial independence. So let's give it one more try.</p>
<p>You have no debts, $500,000 in retirement savings, a primary residence valued at $250,000, and a two-family property also worth $250,000 that generates net positive cash flow of $1,200 per month. Now let's see where you land. Positive cash flow from retirement savings (at 6% return) = $30,000/year or $2,500/month. And if you apply $700 of the $1,200 monthly cash flow from your rental property to pay taxes and insurance on your primary residence, you net a positive $500/month from that &quot;good&quot; rental property asset.</p>
<p>So now you've managed to clear $3,000/month even after the monthly carrying cost of your real estate. If that's enough to cover your monthly living expenses, then you're on your way to financial independence. Add in social security and other supplemental sources of monthly income and you might even have a cushion to cover occasional lump sum purchases and unexpected expenses. Nice going!</p>
<p>As with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wisebread.com/5-steps-toward-financial-independence">any good plan</a>, a retirement plan starts with a clearly defined goal. After all, without one, how do you measure your progress or success? Unfortunately, this part of the retirement planning process is often lacking. Yes, accumulating wealth plays an important role, but it's a supporting role, and it's not the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is financial independence, and that's measured by a different &quot;number&quot; &mdash; monthly cash flow.</p>
<p><em>Do you have a retirement planning goal? What &quot;number&quot; do you use?</em></p>

<p>What if you had a rewards credit card that treats you like you would treat yourself? That's the marketing campaign behind the Discover It card, which promises to provide you with attractive rewards and a personal customer service experience.</p>
<p>With some innovative practices, the Discover It card has been making waves. But how much of it is marketing hype, and how much of it can actually benefit consumers? Let's take a look.</p>
<h2>How This Card Works</h2>
<p>The Discover It card is a rotating cash back credit card. Every quarter, you are required to sign up for the special categories that earn 5% cash back. Discover also has an online mall where you can earn up to 20% cash back on certain purchases. All &quot;regular&quot; purchases earn 1% cash back, and once you reach your 5% special category cash back limit ($1,500 per quarter), category purchases earn cash back at 1%, too.</p>
<p>For 2013, the categories are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jan-Mar: Restaurants and Movies</li>
    <li>April-Jun: Home Improvement</li>
    <li>Jul-Sep: Gas Stations</li>
    <li>Oct-Dec: Holiday Shopping (Restrictions, details to be announced August 1, 2013)</li>
</ul>
<p>This credit card comes with a 14 month 0% introductory APR, and no annual fee. There is also no penalty APR and Discover It won't charge foreign transaction fees.</p>
<h2>Other Benefits</h2>
<p>With the Discover It credit card, you can make your payments up until midnight on the due date, and still be considered &quot;on time.&quot; The fact that you won't be hit with a super-high penalty APR in addition to your late fee is a plus, even if you do end up paying late.</p>
<p>You can redeem your cash back rewards for gift cards (and get up to double cash back when you opt for a gift card rather than cash), cash, or merchandise. It's also possible to use your cash back to make direct payments at Amazon.com (but you have to link your account).</p>
<p>Discover is also promoting its 24/7 U.S. based customer service call center. The company has long been ranked highly for customer service, and with the It card, Discover is once again actively promoting the fact that a real person will answer your call in seconds.</p>
<p>As expected for most credit cards, Discover It comes with a $0 fraud liability guarantee, as well as flight accident insurance, and rental car insurance.</p>
<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>There is no annual fee for the Discover It card. However, there are other costs. If you carry a balance, your APR will be between 10.99% and 22.99%, depending on your credit score. Additionally, if you decide to transfer a balance, you will pay a 3% fee. This is charged even if you are transferring a balance during the 0% APR introductory period.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>The biggest pro to the Discover It card is the cash back rewards program. You can earn up to 5% cash back in rotating categories. For someone who pays attention to the categories and plans out purchases, this can be a great deal.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's definitely a plus that shopping through Discover's online mall can bring you up to 20% cash back &mdash; without the need to worry about categories. Savvy shoppers can also enjoy the fact that choosing certain gift cards as rewards can mean double the cash back. If your favorite store offers a gift card on Discover's bonus program, you can really benefit. And, it's convenient that you can use your rewards to directly pay on Amazon.</p>
<p>The flexibility of the Discover It card is also a plus. You have the ability to pay online or by phone up until 11:59 p.m. on your payment's due date; many credit cards insist that you pay by 3 p.m., 5 p.m., or 7 p.m. for the payment to be properly credited. The lack of a penalty APR is also encouraging. It's also nice that the flexibility of the Discover It card includes no foreign transaction fee, making it ideal for travelers.</p>
<p>Finally, the Discover it card offers a 14-month introductory APR, which is among the longest 0% APRs offered in the credit card industry as of this writing.</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>There are some downsides to the Discover It card. Before you sign up, make sure you understand the rewards program, since there are some quirks that can make it a bit difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>If you want to get the 5% cash back on rotating categories, you have to remember to sign up for the rewards each quarter. If you forget, you will miss out on some of your category earnings.</p>
<p>A second, minor disappointment is that you are limited as to how much you can earn in 5% rewards each quarter &mdash; the award is capped at $1,500 per quarter (after a whopping $30,000 in spending). Once you reach that threshold, your rewards drop to 1%, even if you spend in the quarterly category. This is better than Discover's old program, which started you out at 0.25% cash back until you spent $3,000, but it's still a bit of a disappointment.</p>
<p>Also, while there is a 0% APR, it is a bit disappointing that the Discover It card doesn't offer a signup bonus. Many rewards credit cards offer you a cash bonus just for signing up and spending a certain amount during the initial months of your membership, but the Discover It card isn't one of those credit cards.</p>
<h2>Who This Card Is Best For</h2>
<p>Like many cash back credit cards, the Discover It card is ideal for those who want to earn money on their regular spending. If you are willing to plan out your spending and sign up for the rotating categories, this can be a great card to help you maximize your cash back (as long as you don't habitually hit the quarterly limit).</p>
<p>Because the Discover It card comes with a generous 0% APR, it can be ideal for those who are trying to pay down debt by consolidating balances. As with most rewards credit cards, Discover It works best when you pay off your balance each month so that the interest you pay doesn't offset your cash back earnings.</p>
<p>Those with poor credit who carry balances may not get the best use of this card once the introductory period is over, since the interest rate is a rather high 22.99% for those at the lower end of the credit score scale.</p>
<p>For those looking for a reasonable rewards program and a card with flexibility &mdash; and if you travel overseas and want to avoid transaction fees &mdash; the Discover It card is well worth carrying.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> If you're looking to transfer a balance, there is another version of this card that offers 18 months of the 0% promotional rate for balance transfers (instead of 14 months).  The trade-off is the promo rate for purchases is only 6 months (instead of 14).</p>

<p>So you're ready to invest. Awesome! Investing is one of the simplest &mdash; although not easiest &mdash; ways to build wealth. To help you on your road to success, here are 10 things to ignore, and 10 to keep in mind. (See also: <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/7-investing-lessons-from-the-two-comma-club" target="_blank">7 Investing Lessons From the Two Comma Club</a>)</p>
<h2>Ignore This Stuff</h2>
<p>Let's start with what you should ignore.</p>
<p><strong>1. Hot Managers</strong></p>
<p>A fund manager may be able to pick the right investments once in a while. But can he do it over the long term? The answer is likely no.</p>
<p><strong>2. Hot Stocks</strong></p>
<p>Sure, you could pick the next Apple and strike it rich. But you could also pick the next Enron and go broke. It's much safer to diversify.</p>
<p><strong>3. Hot Sectors</strong></p>
<p>Should you focus on the financial sector? How about the technology sector? The answer to either question is no. Remember the financial crisis of 2008? The dot-com bubble back in 2001? Instead, by investing in a broad market, this won't matter, because you'll be owning all sectors.</p>
<p><strong>4. Daily Performance</strong></p>
<p>In the short-term, the market is moody. Prices go up and down all the time. Stay focused on the long term.</p>
<p><strong>5. Financial News</strong></p>
<p>A lot of the news out there is useless, and sometimes even used to scare you. Ignore the news.</p>
<p><strong>6. Stockbrokers</strong></p>
<p>Often, these people will want you to buy and sell with great frequency. But not for the reason you may think. Since you pay commissions for every trade you make, frequent trading makes brokers rich, not investors.</p>
<p><strong>7. Market Timing</strong></p>
<p>Trying to predict when to buy and sell is a waste of time. No one can accurately predict the future.</p>
<p><strong>8. Morningstar Ratings</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/2013/morningstar-best-mutual-funds/" target="_blank">study of the funds rated</a> &quot;five stars&quot; by Morningstar failed to find evidence that these funds did any better than the four star, or even three star funds.</p>
<p><strong>9. Past Performance</strong></p>
<p>As the saying goes, &quot;Past performance should not be used to predict future performance.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>10. Social Security</strong></p>
<p>I'm not counting on Social Security in my retirement. In fact, <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/mobile/content/en/news.html#news-1" target="_blank">according to the Social Security Administration,</a> the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Trust Funds are expected to become depleted in 2033. So it helps to plan not to have it. Anything you do get will be icing on the cake.</p>
<h2>Pay Attention to This Stuff</h2>
<p>Now, let's dig in to the things you must get right.</p>
<p><strong>1. Asset Allocation</strong></p>
<p>There are two main types of assets: Stocks and bonds. Stock prices move up and down more wildly than bonds. But they also have the chance to make you more money. Asset allocation is how you'll divide your money between the two.</p>
<p>&quot;Why is this important?&quot; you ask?</p>
<p>Studies have shown that your asset allocation makes up 90% of the expected returns you'll achieve.</p>
<p><strong>2. Diversification</strong></p>
<p>Related to asset allocation is diversification. This is about how deep you go into stocks and bonds. It's risky to own just one stock or one bond. The more you own, the more diversified you are. This leads to more safety, helping you sleep better at night while your money still grows.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see how I allocate and diversify my assets, check out the <a href="http://moneytobless.com/simplify-your-investing-with-the-core-four-portfolio/" target="_blank">Core Four Portfolio</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Rebalance</strong></p>
<p>Since stock and bond prices will go up and down, you'll need to make sure your asset allocation stays on track. This is what rebalancing does.</p>
<p><strong>4. Time Horizon</strong></p>
<p>Investing isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/using-time-horizons-to-make-smarter-investments" target="_blank">To win the game,</a> you need patience and lots of time in order for your money to grow.</p>
<p><strong>5. Fees</strong></p>
<p>If you're going to invest in mutual funds, the most important fee to be aware of is the expense ratio. All funds have them. It's crucial to make sure that you're paying the lowest fees possible. The more they charge, the less you keep.</p>
<p><strong>6. Dollar Cost Averaging</strong></p>
<p>This is all about the consistency you bring to investing with regular purchases, which tends to average out the highs and lows. So, if prices are down, there's a sale, and you're buying in preparation for when prices rise again. If prices are up, you're still buying, and your portfolio is growing as well. A win-win situation.</p>
<p><strong>7. Contribution Limits</strong></p>
<p>The more money you contribute, the faster you build wealth. In 2013, you can contribute a maximum of $17,500 to your 401(k) and $5,500 to your IRA.</p>
<p><strong>8. Employer Match</strong></p>
<p>If your employer provides a retirement plan with matching contributions, invest at least enough to get the match. As part of your compensation package, this is money you're entitled to. It'd be unwise to pass up <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/6-ways-to-get-paid-for-saving-money" target="_blank">this extra money</a>.</p>
<p><strong>9. Risk Tolerance</strong></p>
<p>How much risk can you take? If you're young, you can usually take on more risk by investing in a greater amount of stocks. But as you get closer to retirement, you'll probably want to decrease risk by having <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/intro-to-5-super-safe-investments" target="_blank">more of your money in bonds</a>.</p>
<p><strong>10. Beneficiary</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, lots of people don't like to think about death, even though it's inevitable. Choosing your beneficiary will ensure that the person whom you want to receive your money will actually get it.</p>
<p>Ignore the first 10 things above, and follow the second 10, and you'll be on the road to investing success.</p>

<p>Want to make a cool place for your kids to play, but don't want to spend a fortune? Whether you have an entire room or just a dedicated corner, there are a number of ways to make an affordable play space using some creativity, smart shopping, and items you already have around the house. (See also: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wisebread.com/the-best-money-tools-and-toys-for-every-age-group">The Best Money Tools and Toys for Every Age Group</a>)</p>
<h2>1. Turn a Wall Into a Chalkboard</h2>
<p>A nice touch in any child's play area is a chalkboard. Save the money on fancy easel displays or a full-blown hanging board and just paint a wall area with chalkboard paint. This type of paint is now available in any color and transforms your wall into an actual, erasable chalkboard for a fraction of the cost. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/for-your-home/cool-things-to-do-with-chalkboard-paint">Benjamin Moore</a> has a great guide to chalkboard paints, as well as some excellent ideas on how to use these paints beyond the walls.</p>
<h2>2. Make Your Own Storage</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wisebread.com/organize-a-room-for-10-with-no-extra-effort">Storage containers are a necessity</a> to corral the sea of toys most kids seem to have. A great and attractive way to do this on the cheap is to decorate large, sturdy shipping boxes or extra-large diaper boxes. You can try ideas like covering the boxes in brown packaging paper and letting the kids paint or scribble on them. Or, if you are going for a more sophisticated look in a common area, find fabric you love and cover the boxes using glue. I took a hodgepodge of fabric pieces I had lying around and glued them to a giant shipping box to use in our playroom. It makes a great stuffed animal holder.</p>
<h2>3. Find Cheap Seating</h2>
<p>If you are handy sewing, then by all means making a square floor cushion for the kids to lounge on is easy and economical. However, if you are less than jazzed to fire up a sewing machine, there are still some cheap options. Check out affordable floor pillows and poofs from crafters at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>, where there are always some very economical, hand-made styles. Don't forget to check sale areas and clearance racks at superstores and discount stores, where there are usually some decent choices, too.</p>
<h2>4. Decorate the Walls</h2>
<p>Even if your kids are not budding artists, there has to be something they have made in school or at home that can easily get framed and hung on the wall. Some of my three-year-old's abstracts are perfect for this cause. Find a discount frame, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wisebread.com/cheap-ways-to-display-your-art">you have instant wall decor</a>. Personalizing the space with such creations can add flair to a designated kid's corner or playroom and also make the artist proud.</p>
<h2>5. Install Sensible Shelving</h2>
<p>If you are looking to add some shelves or small bookcases, many inexpensive options are available to accomplish the task. Some options, such as storage cubes and crates, only cost a few dollars. Single wall shelves that you can install yourself, like those from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/departments/living_room/10398/">Ikea</a>, are also great options often found for under $20. Or, make a corner useful and look for some budget-friendly, free-standing or wall-installed corner shelves sold at many big box stores. For the more adventurous DIY types, consider other affordable solutions, like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wisebread.com/10-cost-effective-ways-to-make-your-own-bookshelves">making your own bookshelves</a>. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<h2>6. Look Beyond Kid's Furniture</h2>
<p>Often, children's furniture has a huge markup compared to non-kid items. With a little creativity, however, you don't need to buy super expensive kid's furniture to make your playroom complete. Look for cheap coffee tables, other low-height tables, stools, or ottomans that can do double duty as children's tables or seating. I randomly searched online to find a padded, faux leather, living room ottoman for our young daughters to use. There are no sharp corners and it's the perfect height, and it cost all of $40. Or search online to track down kid's tables and chairs on sale, and avoid paying the hefty mark up that many name brand furniture retailers charge for full price items.</p>
<h2>7. Organize an Art Area</h2>
<p>For kids that like to draw or make crafts, consider designating one of your table finds as an art center. You can easily use your table to keep art supplies lined up in containers and within easy reach. Clean and reuse small jars, such as old jam or salsa jars, to hold pencils, markers, and paintbrushes. You can also paint or wrap ribbon around these holders for a decorative touch. Shoeboxes, which can also be embellished to your liking, are great to store crayons and paper scraps, while small jewelry boxes and old spice jars can hold anything small from beads to glitter.</p>
<h2>8. Install Replaceable Flooring</h2>
<p>Kids like to play on the floor. This means that any flooring can get worn or messy. Find a cheap carpet that works in your play space to not only create a comfy place to sit, but also limit the damage to your area rug or hardwood. Carpet tiles are a cheap way to accomplish the task and can be re-arranged and cleaned easily as compared to a rug. There are also foam kid's floor tiles and mats, which often cost a bit more than carpet tiles, but are still pretty affordable, not to mention extra cushiony for smaller kids.</p>
<h2>9. Monogram on a Dime</h2>
<p>Kids love stuff with their names on it. Using monograms on the wall or as labels in a play space is a nice way to decorate and stay organized. You can do cheap stencils on the wall for a just a few dollars by investing in some paint and a craft shop stencil. Or you can find affordable papier mache or large cardboard alphabet letters at craft stores, which can be painted and mounted on the wall or just placed on a shelf. You can also make attractive name labels on your own computer using free templates online, such as the ones found at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bhg.com/decorating/storage/organization-basics/free-printable-storage-labels/">Better Homes and Gardens</a>, which are great for labeling toy boxes and containers.</p>
<h2>10. Source Affordable Dry Erase and Bulletin Boards</h2>
<p>You can easily add a bulletin board or dry erase board to the wall of any play area for well under $10. Dollar stores sell small dry erase boards that you can line up in a row for kids to scribble on or play games. Craft stores and discount home stores also have bulletin board options for older kids looking to hang pictures or artwork. Little touches like these can help make the play area personalized and more inviting.</p>

<p>If you've been following along with our product review articles, then you know we've been supplying you with myriad cooking appliances, which has inevitably riddled your kitchen with dirty dishes. But while most homes come with a dishwasher that can competently handle your cleaning loads, newer dishwashers meet more rigorous efficiency standards, which translate to greater <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/50-ways-to-save-water">savings in energy and water</a> for you. (See also: <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-clean-your-dishwasher">How to Clean Your Dishwasher</a>)</p>
<h2>What Is a Dishwasher?</h2>
<p>A dishwasher cleans dirty dishes by spraying them with hot water, followed by a cleaning mixture composed of water and detergent. After a rinsing cycle, a heating element heats the air inside the dishwasher to dry out the clean dishes. Most tests agree that price does not typically reflect cleaning performance; even budget dishwashers do a great job of cleaning your dishes. Instead, increased price buys you quieter operation and additional bells and whistles.</p>
<h2>Best 5 Dishwashers</h2>

<p>Children are blessings, but raising them from birth to young adulthood can be expensive. Not only do you have to feed and educate them, you also need to clothe and provide shelter for them.</p>
<p>Now that my kids are older teens, I can see that I made plenty of mistakes trying to figure out the best way to control family spending. I also made some smart decisions and observed the wise choices friends made in spending for their children. (See also: <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/7-important-lessons-frugal-parents-teach-their-children" target="_blank">7 Important Lessons Frugal Parents Teach Their Children</a>)</p>
<p>Drawing on years of my experience and those of my parenting friends, here are tips on saving for each year of your child's life.</p>
<h2>Age 0</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li><a href="http://www.wisebread.com/what-a-new-baby-really-needs" target="_blank">Only get baby essentials</a> and avoid buying (or requesting) items      you may not need. Note, however, there are likely to be things you think are      ridiculous while pregnant but find extremely useful after the baby is born.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Set up      a <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/529-plans-for-college-expenses-what-s-cool-and-what-s-quirky" target="_blank">529 college savings plan</a> for your child. Fund the plan      with gifts from grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends, neighbors, colleagues.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Find      solid foods that are easy for babies to eat but don't involve purchasing baby      food. For example, applesauce is great for kids and adults. Also, consider      <a href="http://www.homemade-baby-food-recipes.com/" target="_blank">making      your own baby food</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 1</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Develop      a <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/6-totally-free-babysitting-alternatives" target="_blank">babysitting co-op</a> to save on childcare.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Buy clothing      and toys at <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/ten-cents-an-item-for-high-end-childrens-clothes" target="_blank">community consignment sales</a>. You may be able to shop the      preview sale (and snag the best buys) if you volunteer to assist with the event.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Follow      frugal mom bloggers like <a href="http://www.pennypinchinmom.com/" target="_blank">Penny Pinchin' Mom</a>, who can alert you to special deals      and coach you on saving money at the grocery store and pharmacy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 2</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Learn      to deal with chronic health conditions. Don't fret about every little thing      but know that early and consistent intervention can save money and bring better      outcomes.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Have      frugal fun with basic toys and activities that are age-appropriate, such as sand buckets,      big blocks, and trips to the playground.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Limit      Christmas or holiday gifts to three gifts (or fewer if you are a minimalist).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 3</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Let kids      play with <a href="http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/toddler/top-homemade-toddler-toys-i-ve-made-from-items-around-the-house.aspx" target="_blank">items that are available around the house</a> or found inexpensively      at garage sales, thrift shops, or consignment sales.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Access      free services such as speech therapy, which may be available through your town's      school system.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Save      on <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/6-ways-to-save-money-on-preschool-enrollment?wbref=readmore-2" target="_blank">preschool enrollment</a> by talking to other parents about      the best values in your area.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 4</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Encourage      your kids to engage in activities they truly enjoy, not the ones you enjoyed      as a child or want them to like. They'll be more likely to succeed by pursuing      interests they love. Plus, you won't waste money on gear, coaches, and lessons      that cause family conflict and lead to nowhere.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Cut your      child's hair at home using tips from <a href="http://www.learnvest.com/knowledge-center/video-how-to-cut-kids-hair-at-home-a-pro-shows-you/" target="_blank">this video</a> or these <a href="http://www.parents.com/kids/hygiene/how-to-cut-your-kids-hair/#page=1" target="_blank">step-by-step instructions</a>.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Read      to your kids. One of the easiest, cheapest, and best ways to help kids do well      in school is to read to them when they are young.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 5</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Find      the best public school for your child to avoid private school tuition. This      process may involve getting a system transfer, tracking down a great charter      school, or moving. Look for engaged teachers, strong parent involvement, and      happy children as well as signs of creativity and good test scores.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Take      advantage of &quot;kids eat free&quot; nights at restaurants.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Buy school      supplies when they are on sale. Having items on hand will keep you from paying      full price and save time during the school year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 6</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Sign      up for free swimming lessons at community pools.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Save      on date night by staying home. Feed the kids early, and enjoy a romantic dinner      for two afterward.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Take      your kids out on the town in the evening for free concerts and entertainment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 7</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Host      <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/how-to-throw-a-kid%E2%80%99s-birthday-party-that%E2%80%99s-fun-happily-memorable" target="_blank">simple yet memorable birthday parties</a>, such as an afternoon      at a local park with ice cream and cake.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Teach      your kids to resist the allure of advertised goods.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Save      on <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/home-education-curriculum-on-the-cheap-10-ways-to-learn-for-less?wbref=readmore-3" target="_blank">homeschooling materials</a> and try <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/frugal-ways-to-help-your-child-get-the-best-education" target="_blank">frugal teaching methods</a>, useful whether you are homeschooling      full-time or supplementing your child's education.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 8</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Have      a steady supply of reading material by going to the library and shopping at      consignment sales as well as frequenting used book stores or a virtual equivalent,      such as <a href="http://www.paperbackswap.com/index.php" target="_blank">paperbackswap.com</a>.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Visit      museums, zoos, and gardens on free community days. Pack a lunch and snacks      to avoid paying what are generally high cafeteria prices.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Learn      what kid-oriented services are worth spending on. For example, insights from      a couple of sessions with an educational psychologist (suggested by one of      my son's teachers) helped me to coach him throughout his academic career.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 9</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Support      your children's interest in youth programs such as 4-H or scouting, which offer      inexpensive ways to develop practical skills and have fun.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Sign      your kids up for free summer programs sponsored by community groups, public      schools, church groups, etc.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wisebread.com/save-on-school-expenses-without-ruining-your-kids-childhood" target="_blank">Make memorable and valued teacher gifts</a>, not pricey ones      they'll never use. Have your child write a thank-you note. Organize gift giving      among parents, combining small donations ($1-$5) for a larger gift from the      class.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 10</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Get your      kids to clean up after playing with small pieces of games, puzzles, and Lego      sets. By keeping things together, you are more likely to be successful when      reselling games and toys.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Teach      your 'tweens to handle basic household tasks and take steps to conserve energy      (and cash) through shorter showers, use of cold water to wash clothes, etc.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Encourage      your children to think of <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/15-free-ways-to-entertain-kids-for-an-afternoon" target="_blank">creative ways to entertain themselves and their friends</a>,      such as staging a neighborhood parade or putting together a play for friends      and family.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 11</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Take      the kids to <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/5-reasons-to-travel-off-the-beaten-path" target="_blank">offbeat yet fun vacation spots</a>, which may be much less      expensive than more popular places.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Carpool      with other parents for trips to special activities, summer programs, and more.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Help      your kids to enjoy natural surroundings for free by taking in an early morning      or <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/53-fun-nights-out-for-10-or-less" target="_blank">night outing</a> at a state park or <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/25-ways-to-entertain-your-child-for-free-or-cheap?wbref=slide" target="_blank">exploring your neighborhood</a>. They may enjoy seeing a sunrise,      learning about constellations, or catching a glimpse of wildlife.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 12</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li><a href="http://www.wisebread.com/surefire-ways-to-save-on-summer-camp-costs" target="_blank">Save on summer camp</a> by signing up early or bringing a friend.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Get dental      cleanings, haircuts, and other services from students at your local university,      community college, or trade school.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Work      with your kids to establish a budget for discretionary spending on things like      music, video games, and clothing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 13</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Find      frugal ways for your teen to exercise, if she is not already active. Take a      hike at a local park, discover programs that teach a new sport, try a <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/8-legit-ways-to-use-the-gym-for-free" target="_blank">free class at the gym</a>, or <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/22-fun-and-free-summertime-exercise-ideas" target="_blank">check out other fun ways to get a workout sans spending</a>.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Open      a savings account or investment account for your teen so he or she can begin      saving or investing.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Help      them to learn a trade such as babysitting, mowing grass, or lifeguarding. Not      only will they be able to earn money, they won't get (as) bored and on school breaks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 14</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Take      your teens shopping for clothes at Goodwill or thrift shops. They may enjoy      unearthing designer labels at steeply discounted prices.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Give      your teens freedom with fashion within reason, especially if their choices      are frugal ones. For example, let them to wear shorts year-round if it means      not buying pants they'll quickly outgrow.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Encourage      them to sell their stuff for spending money. Provide guidance on selling via      yard sales or eBay.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 15</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Encourage      your teens to volunteer and get accustomed to interacting with people with      limited resources. Help them to appreciate what they have and better understand      the need to be good stewards of money and talents, both frugal life skills.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Teach      them that it's okay to zig when everyone else is zagging. This lesson will      help them to pursue their own dreams, rather than wasting time and money chasing      things they think others expect them to do.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
<li>Keep      open communications so they will tell you about their plans (good and not-so-good)      and their friends' habits. Don't judge, but help steer them in the right direction,      so they can avoid making stupid and costly mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age 16</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Take      advantage of free tutoring or assistance available at the school before paying      for outside help. Ask friends to help if teacher instruction is not available.<br />

    &nbsp;</li>

</ul>
<h2>Age 17</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Age 18</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Let your      kids do research on colleges and universities so they can see firsthand how      inexpensive in-state tuition is compared to private and out-of-state colleges      and universities.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>

<p>I've learned that we cannot (and should not) spend on everything that's marketed to parents and their children. Sorting through what's worthwhile and what's not is often easier understood in hindsight, because what's right varies among families. Spending strategically can save money, reduce stress, and encourage kids to consider priorities.</p>

<p>On one of my first award flights in international business class, I was settling into my lie flat seat for the 13-hour flight, just as economy class passengers were boarding. One of them gasped at my accommodations and asked, &quot;How did you get that seat?&quot; The only response I could offer was &quot;Collect frequent flier miles.&quot; I doubt she was satisfied by that answer, but if you are serious about earning the most points and miles, I'll share some of my more advanced techniques. (See also: <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/become-a-frequent-flyer-master-and-earn-a-free-flight-every-year">Become a Frequent Flyer Master and Earn a Free Flight Every Year</a>)</p>
<h2>1. Focus on Sign Up Bonuses</h2>
<p>I earn hundreds of thousands of points a year, but I don't buy airline tickets with dollars and I certainly don&rsquo;t spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on my credit cards. Thankfully, we are fortunate to live in a time when banks are willing to offer hundreds, or even thousands of dollars worth of rewards, just to give new customers a chance to earn their business. Currently, there are some fantastic sign-up bonuses available that are worth 50,000 points or miles, or two free nights in the most luxurious hotels. Each of those can be worth about two thousand dollars to those who use their points and miles wisely.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, cardholders need to be careful. Only sign up for new credit cards if doing so will not be an incentive for you to spend more than necessary. And if you have credit card debt, focus on paying it off, not earning rewards. If you are wondering how far you can take this, learn more <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/credit-card-churning-making-the-most-of-bonus-offers">about credit card churning</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Watch for Bonus Spending Categories</h2>
<p>You can earn tens of thousands of points or miles without spending tens of thousands of dollars. The trick is to use credit cards that offer double, triple, or even more rewards on certain categories of spending.</p>
<p>For example, the Chase Freedom, Discover It, and Citi Dividend Platinum Select each offer 5x rewards for spending on categories that change each quarter. I get 5x points for charging office supplies, telephone, and Internet service to my Chase Ink Bold card, and I earn double points for dining and travel charges on my Chase Sapphire Preferred card. Find the cards that will give you the biggest bonuses for the purchases you make the most, and use them strategically.</p>
<h2>3. Spend Shifting</h2>
<p>What if your card is offering 5x miles at grocery stores, but you need to make a major purchase from a hardware store? Simply go to your grocery store and buy a gift card for the hardware store. In many cases, you can even buy generic Visa, MasterCard, or American Express gift cards at grocery, drug, and office supply stores. These cards can be used anywhere within their respective payment networks, but just make sure that the miles you receive are worth any extra fees you must pay.</p>
<h2>4. Manufactured Spending</h2>
<p>The holy grail of advance mileage earning is to buy something with a mileage earning credit card, and somehow use that purchase to pay off the card. This was once just the territory of <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/extreme-mileage-hacking-creative-ways-to-earn-flier-miles">extreme mileage hackers</a>, but it is now being used by hobbyists to varying degrees.</p>
<p>What changed?</p>
<p>Banks are now racing to offer pre-paid debit cards to the &quot;underbanked&quot; population, and it is sometimes possible to use a credit card to purchase reloads for these cards. The money can then be withdrawn from an ATM or even used to pay off the credit card bill electronically. Other times, people purchase gift cards, and use those cards to purchase money orders that are then deposited in their bank accounts just like checks. In addition, people use electronic payment services such as Amazon.com to pay each other via their credit card.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>So how do you get started? First, do lots of research. New opportunities constantly arise and loopholes constantly close as this hobby has become a cat and mouse game between reward travel enthusiasts and financial service providers. Be aware that people are happy to disclose their failures online, but less enthusiastic share their success and risk having a loophole become popularized. Be sure to focus on credit cards with spending bonuses, as these products will be more likely to offer rewards in excess of any fees you are charged.</p>
<p>Next, just dip your toe in. Make a small purchase of a reload pack or a gift card, and try to cash it out. You will want to test any technique before scaling it up, as there are lots of ways this can go wrong. In fact, some transactions can be approved or denied depending on the region you live in, the store you visit, or even the cashier on duty that day. Finally, don&rsquo;t bother with this unless you have your finances in order and are good at keeping things organized.</p>
<p>Earning a few thousand points for a reward trip to Disney World is easy enough, but the real challenge is earning hundreds of thousands of miles for <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/5-tips-for-scoring-a-frequent-flyer-rewards-flight">a premium class international trip</a>. By learning about advanced mileage earning techniques, you too can eventually invite jealous stares from your business class seat.</p>

The bill, which heads to the House floor today, reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or ESEA, currently known as the No Child Left Behind Act, or NCLB.</p>
<p>While NCLB is long overdue for reconsideration, the Student Success Act overlooks the long history this country has of underserving low-income students, English language learners, and students of color. Under the guise of strengthening local control over schools, the Student Success Act bargains away equity. The House majority argues that the bill will “<a href="http://edworkforce.house.gov/studentsuccessact/reducingthefederalfootprint.htm">reduce the federal footprint</a>” in education, but the bill does so at the expense of students. The bill weakens federal oversight in areas that have traditionally failed the most disadvantaged students.</p>
<p>Here’s what you should know about the Student Success Act.</p>
<h3>The bill prioritizes state flexibility over preparing students for college and careers</h3>
<p>While the Student Success Act requires states to adopt standards in reading and math, the bill does nothing to ensure that state standards are rigorous enough to make sure students graduate from school college and career ready. What’s more, the bill does not require states to set targets and goals to evaluate whether schools are improving student achievement and graduation rates.</p>
<p>Under NCLB, states already have a great deal of flexibility in setting their own targets for student achievement. But federal oversight to ensure that states are setting sufficiently ambitious targets has proven to be critical in the years since NCLB was first passed.</p>
<p>States that request flexibility from the U.S. Department of Education regarding NCLB’s outdated accountability requirements have the opportunity to redesign their accountability systems and set their own targets and goals for student achievement. The behavior of some states under the department’s flexibility process, however, provides a glimpse of what might arise if a system of checks and balances is not in place. Take House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s (R) own state, for instance. Virginia’s initial accountability plan, submitted in July 2012, included <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2012/08/_this_is_not_what.html">less ambitious</a> annual academic achievement targets for black students compared to their white peers. Complaints from Virginia advocates and parents swelled, <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2012/08/_this_is_not_what.html">compelling</a> the Department of Education and the Commonwealth of Virginia to negotiate a new accountability plan.</p>
<p>But what if federal oversight was limited and states were left to their own accord? What recourse would parents and advocates have then? Under the Student Success Act, not much.</p>
<h3>The bill relies on transparency as accountability</h3>
<p>Similar to the No Child Left Behind Act, the Student Success Act requires states and districts to annually assess students in reading and math and publicly report those results to parents. Beyond that, however, states and districts have a great deal of discretion over what needs to happen to underperforming schools. Theoretically, chronically underperforming schools can continue to conduct business as usual—endlessly. The idea here is that parents with children in underperforming schools will take it upon themselves to hold schools accountable on their own or rely on states and districts to act in good faith and intervene when schools are failing.</p>
<p>But prior to the Obama administration’s revamp of the School Improvement Grant program, when states and districts had broad flexibility over school interventions, <a href="http://www.educationsector.org/publications/restructuring-restructuring">few</a> states and districts took bold steps to turn around schools or close them down. It seems fair to ask states and districts that use federal dollars to drive school improvement to abide by some federal parameters, including a reasonable timeline to demonstrate improvement.</p>
<h3>The bill permits inequities in funding</h3>
<p>The Student Success Act neglects to close a <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education/news/2011/08/29/10125/video-tipping-the-scales/">well-known federal loophole</a> that allows districts to allocate fewer total dollars to high-poverty schools compared to more affluent schools. In the grand scheme of things, federal dollars make up a very small portion of school funding—a little more than <a href="http://febp.newamerica.net/background-analysis/school-finance">10 percent</a>. The bulk of school funding comes from state and local tax dollars.</p>
<p>But here’s where the federal role matters: Federal Title I dollars are intended to narrow the funding gap between high- and low-poverty schools, and current law requires districts to ensure that schools receiving Title I dollars and those not receiving such funds have comparable resources before federal dollars are added. But the ability of federal Title I dollars to equalize school funding is undermined by a common practice that allows districts to use average teacher-salary figures and teacher-student ratios in their school budget allocations, masking inequities.</p>
<p>What’s the cost? Schools that are 90 percent nonwhite spend <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/UnequalEduation-1.pdf">$733</a> less per pupil than mostly white schools. These disparities can add up. The average-sized high-minority school is losing out on $443,000 per year, the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/UnequalEduation-1.pdf">equivalent</a> of hiring 12 additional first-year teachers or nine veteran teachers.</p>
<p>Faced with the opportunity to reduce funding disparities, the House majority bill essentially condones our nation’s longstanding practice of providing high-need schools with the least resources.<strong></strong></p>
<h3>The bill allows state and local education budgets to be slashed</h3>
<p>The Student Success Act also removes federal requirements that ensure states and districts maintain their share of education funding from year to year. The <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education/news/2012/02/15/11062/denying-poor-children-an-equitable-education/">“maintenance of effort” requirement</a> in current law requires districts receiving Title I funds to spend at least 90 percent of what they spent in local and state dollars in the previous year. This provision is meant to prevent districts from slashing their education budgets unscrupulously and provides schools with some reliability in annual funding.</p>
<p>As we have warned <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education/report/2012/02/01/11078/cut-and-run/">previously</a>, eliminating the maintenance-of-effort provision “is a recipe for converting federal funds into state and local tax relief,” and many of the arguments for eliminating the provision do not hold water. As House Republicans <a href="http://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/the_student_success_act_detailed_summary.pdf">note</a> themselves, current law already includes a great deal of flexibility for districts seeking relief from this requirement, including states and districts that face a severe funding shortfall due to the tough fiscal climate. In general, however, safeguarding funding for education in exchange for $14.5 billion in Title I dollars seems like a fair shake for districts and states that accept the federal support.</p>
<h3>A smarter, progressive vision for renewing ESEA</h3>
<p>In pursuit of flexibility and increased local control, the House Republican bill limits federal oversight in ways that can actually undermine educational opportunities for students. But the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:S.1094:">Senate ESEA bill</a> that passed out of committee in June, as well as House Education and Workforce Committee Ranking Member George Miller’s (D-CA) <a href="http://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hr_5_miller_substitute.pdf">proposal</a>, offer a better way forward. These proposals include recommendations that we have outlined in <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education/report/2011/06/14/9847/a-way-forward/">our vision</a> for reauthorizing ESEA.</p>
<p>Any reauthorization of ESEA should do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hold all schools accountable for getting results with all students.</strong> ESEA should continue to require states to set high standards and annual goals for all students.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in teachers and principals so they become more skilled and effective.</strong> States should be required to develop and implement educator evaluation systems to ensure every student has access to a strong teacher.</li>
<li><strong>Make funding practices more fair and efficient.</strong> This includes requiring districts to show that Title I schools receive comparable dollars to non-Title I schools.</li>
<li><strong>Take action and target support to low-performing schools.</strong> While ESEA should offer states flexibility in tailoring interventions to schools, federal parameters are necessary to ensure states and districts use federal dollars for effective strategies that are most likely to support school improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in innovative practices that bring American schools into the 21st century.</strong> These practices should include support for schools to redesign and expand their school calendar and competitive funds that support innovation and education reform.</li>
</ul>
<p>These principles are an essential part of ensuring that all children receive a high-quality education and should form the foundation of a new ESEA.</p>

<p>Each year the U.S. government loans hundreds of billions of dollars to American households and businesses through federal credit programs. This credit is extended throughout the economy in a number of sectors, ranging from education to agriculture, housing, and small businesses. In his Climate Action Plan released last month, President Barack Obama announced new ways that this money would also be used to support clean energy.</p>
<p>The Climate Action Plan is a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change. It:</p>
<ul>
<li>Includes policies to reduce carbon pollution from power plants and the transportation sector through new fuel-economy standards for trucks and other large vehicles</li>
<li>Replaces dirty energy sources with cleaner alternatives such as wind and solar</li>
<li>Reduces the total amount of energy used in the United States</li>
<li>Links these domestic approaches with international efforts such as a global treaty on pollution reductions</li>
<li>Helps people deal with climate change that is already happening by investing in infrastructure that will be resilient in the face of extreme weather caused by climate change</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these efforts requires unique tools, but federal credit—loans and loan guarantees that the government offers to businesses and households—is a theme that runs through every effort.</p>
<p>In some cases, the plan explicitly details the use of federal credit:</p>
<ul>
<li>The president is making $8 billion in loan guarantees available for advanced fossil-fuel projects through the Department of Energy’s Loan Guarantee Program.</li>
<li>The Rural Utilities Service is close to finalizing a plan to loan $250 million to homeowners and businesses for energy-efficiency improvements.</li>
<li>The Obama administration has committed to stop providing financing for new coal plants around the world, which will impact credit provided by the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the World Bank.</li>
</ul>
<p>But other objectives in the plan could also be supported by federal credit:</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of deploying advanced transportation technologies could be aided by loans from the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program, which has existing budget authority to issue billions of dollars in loans.</li>
<li>Various housing-credit programs that are run out of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and are intended to help make improvements on existing buildings could be targeted to energy efficiency and even small-scale renewable energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>While some of these programs may sound small, their impacts add up. Each year the president’s budget includes information on how many loans and loan guarantees the government expects to make from various programs. By identifying the programs that could potentially be used for clean energy—as opposed to those such as student loans that do not realistically have an energy angle—we have identified more than $100 billion that could be mobilized in support of clean energy each year. Not all of this money will go to clean energy, of course, since many of these programs have other critical goals that must be met, but moving even half of this money to clean energy would reap important benefits.</p>
<h3>Federal credit: Good for taxpayers, good for clean energy</h3>
<p>There are two main reasons we should use federal credit to support clean energy: It is a good deal for taxpayers, and it targets a specific challenge that is holding back clean energy deployment.</p>
<p>First, when someone borrows money from the government, they usually pay it back. This means that moving $100 billion in loans and loan guarantees ultimately costs taxpayers only a small portion of that $100 billion in the actual price tag for defaults. In fact, while the cost varies by program, previous research from the Center for American Progress found that every $100 the government lends or guarantees only costs taxpayers 79 cents. In other words, the government could move $100 billion toward clean energy deployment, and taxpayers would only have to pay for less than 1 percent of it.</p>
<p>Second, moving money through credit programs solves a key challenge facing clean energy: finding attractive financing. Despite significant advances achieved in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, clean energy is still hindered by a dearth of affordable capital for large-scale investments. For capital-intensive clean energy projects, the cost of paying for that capital is one of the largest—if not the largest—drivers of the cost of the energy that is ultimately generated by that project. To continue bringing down the cost of clean energy, the administration must take actions that will bring down the cost of capital. Using federal credit to lower the risk to investors and bring down the cost of clean energy for consumers is one important tool the president has to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>While federal credit is present throughout the Climate Action Plan, it is not treated in a comprehensive way. Below are three steps President Obama can take to ensure that credit programs have the best possible climate impact.</p>
<h4>Use federal credit programs in a coordinated fight against climate change</h4>
<p>President Obama needs to ensure that all federal credit programs are working together to advance clean energy. To start, the president can organize a Clean Energy Finance Task Force made up of senior leadership from the Treasury Department; Rural Utilities Service; U.S. Export-Import Bank; Overseas Private Investment Corporation; Department of Housing and Urban Development; Department of Transportation; Department of Energy Loan Programs Office; Small Business Administration; and all other government entities that can invest in clean energy projects. This task force should be chaired by a senior official from the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, reflecting OMB’s role in managing risk in federal credit programs.</p>
<p>The president should instruct the task force to share best practices on clean energy financing, coordinate efforts to make sure that the entire clean energy value chain—including manufacturing—is being served, and create streamlined processes to direct loan applicants to the most appropriate sources of capital. The task force should also explore ways that these federal credit programs could support the publicly traded debt, which would be extremely valuable in lowering the cost of capital for energy-efficiency projects and is the source of low-cost capital for most of the economy. The government has not previously undertaken this sort of financial support in the clean energy space, and the relevant officials should explore ways to do this using existing authority. This task force would be modeled after the very successful Rapid Response Team for Transmission, an effort led by the Council on Environmental Quality to coordinate actions across the federal agencies responsible for siting transmission lines.</p>
<p>As a following step, the president should issue an executive order stating that every government financing entity must adopt a strategy to reduce the greenhouse-gas pollution from their investments in accordance with the administration’s international climate commitments. Meeting the goal of a 17 percent pollution reduction from 2005 levels by 2020—as President Obama committed to in 2009—will require the full commitment of the U.S. government, and no office within the government should be making investments at odds with this commitment. This will be particularly important for programs already doing significant energy lending, such as the Rural Utilities Service and the Export-Import Bank.</p>
<h4>Coordinate U.S. action with global financing entities</h4>
<p>In his Climate Action Plan, President Obama called for “an end to U.S. government support for public financing of new coal plants overseas,” with some exceptions for extreme cases. This applies to U.S. government credit programs such as the Export-Import Bank, as well as U.S. participation in international financing tools, most notably the World Bank. Going forward, the president should make sure that in addition to not financing new coal plants, international credit tools are coordinated to maximize their impact. This includes the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the World Bank, as well as the Green Climate Fund—a special financing tool set up to help marshal a commitment of mobilizing $100 billion per year in climate finance for resilience and mitigation in developing countries by 2020. The Green Climate Fund can use many of the same credit tools as U.S. credit programs, including loans and loan guarantees, to leverage large amounts of private capital.</p>
<h4>Move quickly to advance renewable energy from the Department of Energy’s Loan Guarantee Program</h4>
<p>While different types of clean energy projects can be supported by multiple federal credit programs, only the Department of Energy’s Loan Guarantee Program is capable of supporting large renewable energy projects—except for those owned by electric cooperatives, which can be financed by the Rural Utilities Service. These large projects take multiple years to develop and need to meet specific deadlines to take advantage of other federal incentives such as the investment tax credit—only solar projects completed by the end of 2016 are eligible for this credit—or the production tax credit—only wind projects that begin construction by the end of 2013 are eligible for this credit. Large projects also often involve permitting issues with other federal agencies such as the Department of the Interior, especially when the projects are on public lands. Because of the time-sensitive and cross-governmental nature of these projects, the Department of Energy must move quickly to begin soliciting applications for renewable energy, not just for advanced fossil-fuel projects.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The government can mobilize billions of dollars toward clean energy every year using existing federal credit programs. At the same time, we will also need billions of dollars to flow toward new investments in renewable and efficient energy annually over the next decade if we want a fighting chance of slowing global climate change. President Obama has made a critical link through his Climate Action Plan by connecting these two facts.</p>
<p>Yet there are also important opportunities to do more and go further, as described in this issue brief. First, the president can coordinate all domestic programs to make sure they are working toward the same clean energy future. Second, he can coordinate domestic programs with international efforts to maximize their impact. Third, he can move quickly with the Department of Energy’s credit capacity to leverage other government programs for renewable energy projects. These three steps will deliver greater returns for taxpayers and help solve the problem of climate change.</p>

Russia this week blocked efforts to create marine reserves off the coast of Antarctica, which would protect species and preserve habitats.</p><p>Remember back in the Cold War days when battle lines were clear? Americans wore the white hats, and the Soviet Union sported the black? <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089927/">Rocky IV</a>? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezAhyZssgcI">U.S.A. 4, U.S.S.R. 3</a>?</p>
<p>Those old roles re-emerged somewhat this week in Bremerhaven, Germany, when the Russian Federation—supported by one of its former soviet territories, Ukraine—stood up not just to the United States but also to the European Union and the <a href="http://www.ccamlr.org/en/organisation/members">other 23 members</a> of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR. At a special intercessional meeting, the commission was poised to implement arguably the single-greatest accomplishment in high-seas international ocean conservation—the establishment of massive marine reserves in the waters of the Southern Ocean off the coast of Antarctica—when <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23327315">Russia used its veto power</a> to block implementation.</p>
<p>Marine reserves, also known as <a href="http://www.asoc.org/issues-and-advocacy/antarctic-environmental-protection/marine-protected-areas">marine protected areas</a>, are portions of the ocean set aside for some level of special protection. They can include no-fishing zones and typically have other strict regulations on industrial activity. The <a href="http://www.ccamlr.org/en/news/2013/media-information-bremerhaven-meetings">proposed Southern Ocean reserves</a> would cover more than 3.8 million square kilometers of the Ross Sea and other areas around Antarctica—more space than all of the <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=85899490790">world’s existing marine reserves</a> combined.</p>
<p>On Monday night, as members of the U.S. Senate <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-poised-to-take-up-key-rule-changes/2013/07/16/167045da-ee1d-11e2-9008-61e94a7ea20d_story.html">cloistered themselves</a> in the Old Senate Chamber in the Capitol in an attempt to prevent Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) from invoking the so-called nuclear option to break the logjam of Republican filibusters, the heads of delegation to CCAMLR concluded their own special meeting. And if you think the U.S. Congress’s deliberative process is dysfunctional, consider this: The Senate emerged from its meeting with the framework of a deal. CCAMLR did not.</p>
<p>Because CCAMLR, similar to many international organizations, requires unanimity among its members to pass resolutions, Russian opposition means the proposal will not move forward, despite support from every other participating country except Ukraine. It’s widely expected that Ukraine will follow Russia’s lead if its larger neighbor decides to permit the designation.</p>
<p>Part of the reason Russia’s opposition came as such a surprise to other members of the commission is that the Russians were the ones who <a href="http://en.mercopress.com/2013/07/17/russia-blocks-creation-of-two-huge-marine-protected-areas-in-antarctica">requested the special meeting</a> at the conclusion of the annual meeting last October in Hobart, Australia. As this was just the second special meeting ever called in the more than 30-year history of the commission, observers and other member states believed a deal was in the offing.</p>
<p>So what caused the Russians to balk?</p>
<p>One theory is that fishing interests may have fueled the opposition. <a href="http://www.ccamlr.org/en/fisheries/toothfish-fisheries">Antarctic and Patagonian toothfish</a>, more commonly seen on restaurant menus as Chilean sea bass, became an increasingly sought-after species in the 1990s and continues to be prized by chefs and diners for its mild-tasting flesh. Toothfish mature and reproduce slowly, which means overfishing can easily occur, and illegal catches were rampant until recently.</p>
<p>Similarly, krill—tiny shrimp-like creatures that occur in massive blooms and serve as the primary food source for many penguin, seal, and whale populations in the Southern Ocean—are now being pursued with increasing vigor by the world’s fishing fleets. They are harvested as feed for <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100901/full/467015a.html">aquaculture</a> operations and aquariums and, increasingly, for Omega-3-rich <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/science/tracking-antarctic-krill-as-more-is-harvested-for-omega-3-pills.html?pagewanted=all">krill oil</a>. At present, however, the Russians have just <a href="http://www.ccamlr.org/en/compliance/licensed-vessels">five fishing vessels</a> operating in the Ross Sea region, meaning they are likely not influential enough to have sufficiently swayed their government’s opinion.</p>
<p>Rather, Russian opposition to the sanctuaries focused on a procedural issue they had not raised at previous meetings. Instead of questioning the science or rationale for the reserves, the Russian delegation insisted the commission had <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/planet-oz/2013/jul/17/antarctica-australia-marine-sanctuary-commission-meeting">no legal right</a> to establish them in the first place. Such protestations really amount to little more than stall tactics. CCAMLR’s guidelines, approved by all member states, including Russia, clearly grant the commission this authority. In fact, the organization has <a href="http://www.mpatlas.org/mpa/sites/5283/">already established one marine protected area</a>—the world’s first outside any national jurisdiction—off the coast of Antarctica’s South Orkney Islands.</p>
<p>The commission’s efforts to protect some of the most pristine regions on the planet come as the United Nations and other international bodies are ramping up their efforts to address the lack of management of perhaps the planet’s last unregulated area—the high seas. Individual nations have jurisdiction over waters extending out to 200 miles from their shores—and slightly farther than that in the case of some “extended continental shelf” claims. But this still leaves nearly half of the world’s oceans outside any one country’s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>John Podesta, Chair of the Center for American Progress, recently joined the <a href="http://www.globaloceancommission.org/">Global Ocean Commission</a>, an organization developing recommendations to improve international management of the high seas. As the CCAMLR meeting got underway, the Global Ocean Commission’s co-chairs sent a letter to the leaders of CCAMLR’s member states urging approval of the sanctuaries that would enhance international protection of critical habitats. The co-chairs <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Letter-to-President-Obama-from-the-Global-Ocean-Commission.pdf">called the proposals</a> “a significant and historic foundation for global ocean ecosystem protection.”</p>
<p>The Global Ocean Commission and other proponents of the sanctuaries are not giving up despite this setback, and the issue will be back on the table at CCAMLR’s 2013 annual meeting, which is to be held once more in Hobart, Australia, in October. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry issued a strong <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2013/07/212063.htm">statement</a> following the meeting in Germany this week, saying that “a formulation for protecting the Ross Sea can and will be found, period.”</p>
<p>In a seminal article published in 1968, Garrett Hardin detailed a dilemma he dubbed “<a href="http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html">the tragedy of the commons</a>.” He theorized that the absence of regulation of commonly held property would inevitably result in its destruction. The <a href="http://www.asoc.org/issues-and-advocacy/antarctic-governance">agreement governing the Antarctic continent</a> represents perhaps our greatest example of cooperative management of a commons. It is time to extend those principles to the Southern Ocean as well.</p>

<div>
<p>While several provisions of the Affordable Care Act have gone into effect, there is still one large hurdle to ensuring full implementation of the law in 2014: expanding Medicaid programs in all 50 states. Without this expansion, 11.5 million Americans whose incomes are too high to qualify for existing Medicaid coverage but too low to afford participation in the new health care exchanges set up by the law could go without insurance.</p>
<p>In June 2012 the Supreme Court ruled that Medicaid expansion was an optional provision of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and that states could not be penalized for refusing to expand their programs. House Republicans, however, have harshly criticized all components of the ACA, including the Medicaid expansion. The House of Representatives has voted more than 30 times to repeal the legislation, and already 13 states have refused to expand their Medicaid programs, despite the fact that the costs to the states will be modest. In some cases, states will even experience a net gain.</p>
<p>In the face of such obstacles, faith leaders and advocates from diverse traditions across the nation are urging governors and state legislators to do the right thing and expand their Medicaid programs to cover eligible, uninsured citizens. Faith leaders have a long history of supporting Medicaid as part of their anti-poverty work. Many faith communities run clinics or hospitals that provide health care to low-income people who lack health insurance, and they know firsthand the needs of their communities. In addition, faith communities deeply believe in providing protection and care for the most vulnerable in our society. Because of their expertise, their familiarity with their communities, and their spiritual beliefs, faith communities have been key participants in coalitions—joining with hospitals, businesses, economists, health care experts, advocates, and others—to urge states to expand their Medicaid programs and provide much-needed health care to their citizens.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Why we need to expand Medicaid</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Medicaid expansion will substantially strengthen states’ safety nets for their poorest residents at little cost to states. If enacted, the expansion covers all people with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty line, which in 2013 is $15,417 for individuals and $26,347 for a family of three. The federal government will pay for 100 percent of the expansion population until 2017. After that the federal government’s match rate will start to decline, but even when the state contribution rates hit their peak in 2020, states will only be responsible for 10 percent of the costs. This allows already cash-strapped states to spend less money on costly uncompensated care and frees up resources to be used elsewhere.</p>
<p>Without the expansion as intended under the Affordable Care Act, millions of low-income Americans will fall into a coverage gap and be excluded from health care insurance. When writing the law, Congress intended that the poorest Americans would gain health care coverage through Medicaid, while those with slightly higher incomes would be able to buy private coverage through the exchanges with the assistance of federal subsidies. In states where the Medicaid program is not expanded, many low-income workers and families will be ineligible for Medicaid, as well as for the subsidies under the Affordable Care Act that help people above the poverty line afford health care coverage through an exchange plan.</p>
<p>A person with income at 90 percent of the federal poverty line in a state that does not expand Medicaid, for example, would be forced to pay the full price for insurance coverage. Someone in the same state earning slightly more—at 100 percent of the federal poverty line—would receive a federal subsidy to make purchasing coverage through the state’s exchange more affordable. Within this coverage gap, those living just above the poverty line will be forced to pay higher premiums for their coverage. Those living below that level almost certainly will still be without insurance and paying extremely high out-of-pocket costs. These financial burdens will also affect families who support the elderly or other low-income individuals, and health care providers who will absorb the health costs of those without insurance and those who rely on hospitals or charitable centers for their health care.</p>
<h3>Why faith leaders and advocates are important allies</h3>
<p>Faith-based coalitions addressing health care are diverse, in part because the issue is an important moral value within virtually all faith traditions. Religious advocates have created coalitions of Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Buddhist, Muslim, Unitarian Universalist, and other faiths because protecting the poor and sick is an essential tenant of all major religions. Inspired by these values, faith communities have long spoken out for reforming the health care system to ensure that the vulnerable have access to care. These communities have found common ground and repeatedly collaborated on addressing local, national, and global health concerns.</p>
<div>
<p>Most faith communities have long supported Medicaid as an important safety net to protect the poor and sick. In fact, faith groups filed an amicus brief in support of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, articulating the moral imperative for the program. In 2011 many religious denominations signed an interfaith statement in support of Medicaid and Medicare because of their protection of what is “at the heart of our sacred texts”—caring for the most vulnerable, particularly America’s low-income women, men, children, and people with disabilities.</p>
<h3>Building on established, successful networks</h3>
<p>Faith leaders and advocates have been able to build upon already-established networks and structures that were active in the Affordable Care Act of 2010. As key advocates in supporting the ACA, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the United Methodist Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Episcopal Church, the Union for Reform Judaism, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, and many others engaged in the health care debate and were key to the bill’s passage, developing staff policy expertise, religious resources, and networks of organizers. These organizations have continued to champion the law, and denominational staffers and coalitions, such as the Washington Interreligious Staff Community Health Care Working Group, are now working to expand Medicaid.</p>
<p>Faithful Reform in Health Care, an interfaith coalition of organizations founded to advocate for health care reform, has continued to educate and connect faith communities through monthly conference calls to share best practices related to implementation of the ACA, including Medicaid expansion. Similarly, the National Council of Jewish Women, or NCJW, is working with its local affiliates in Missouri, Texas, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, as well as with interfaith coalitions, to expand Medicaid. Last spring, 350 NCJW advocates came to Washington, D.C., to learn more about Medicaid as an economic justice issue.</p>
<p>In Texas, Dallas Area Interfaith began several years ago to advocate for health care reform. After speaking with the more than 3,000 members of their group, Dallas Area Interfaith determined that health care was a primary concern within their community and began advocacy for the ACA. When Gov. Rick Perry (R-TX) announced last July that he would not expand Medicaid, the group sprang into action once again.</p>
<p>Gwen Lummus, chair of the health care committee at Dallas Area Interfaith, said faith leaders felt it was unacceptable for a state as wealthy as Texas—with the highest rate of uninsured people in the nation—to refuse expanding Medicaid to 1,798,314 more Texans if there was an opportunity to do so. Even though they knew it would be difficult to push Gov. Perry and the Republican-majority legislature to reverse their stance, the coalition of religious leaders began working with other faith congregations in the state to build upon the networks established during the health care debate and to raise public awareness and create political pressure for the expansion.</p>
<div>
<p>The group held private meetings with business owners, community leaders, hospitals, and elected officials. They sponsored public events, press conferences, and rallies, including one with more than 200 faith leaders from diverse faith traditions on the steps of the Capitol in Austin. They also garnered more than 5,000 signatures from people of faith calling for Medicaid expansion. Although Gov. Perry and the Republican state legislature refused to budge, the efforts of faith communities received statewide attention, and Gov. Perry has had to publically defend his decision three times since these faith groups began organizing.</p>
<h3>Unusual coalitions are forming to make the case</h3>
<p>Because faith communities are strong supporters of Medicaid, some of those who are otherwise against the Affordable Care Act—or who stayed on the sidelines during the debate—are joining forces to support Medicaid expansion. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops is supporting this expansion despite the fact that it opposed the passage of the ACA and many of its members are currently involved in the lawsuits against the contraception-coverage requirement in the act.</p>
<p>Tracy Moebius of the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Columbus, Ohio, and a member of BREAD, an interfaith group that is advocating for Medicaid expansion in the state, points out that “expanding Medicaid is not the same as endorsing the Affordable Care Act.” In fact, conservative groups such as Ohio Right to Life and the Ohio Catholic Conference, who are opposed to the ACA, favor expanding Medicaid.</p>
<p>Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis has lobbied lawmakers for Medicaid expansion and suspects that “there’s a lot more people who identify themselves as conservatives who support this than those who do not. From a faith-based social conservative perspective, I struggle to find anybody who can tell me this isn’t a good idea.”</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, 1,350 Roman Catholic nuns, priests, and brothers, representing 19 different religious congregations, signed a letter to Gov. Tom Corbett (R) urging him to expand Medicaid coverage to nearly 700,000 uninsured residents. In Louisiana, the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, the largest group of nuns in America, urged Catholic Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) to reverse his refusal to expand Medicaid, reminding him of Catholic teachings to care for the poor. In Mississippi, the annual Catholic Day at the Capitol focused on Medicaid expansion and brought parishioners from the Gulf Coast and Jackson to urge legislators to show compassion and extend Medicaid.</p>

<h3>The role of faith-based health care providers</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Faith-based clinics and hospitals can speak to the moral concerns of their communities. As providers, however, they can speak to the health needs of their communities as well.</p>
<p>Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas, Inc., for example, a faith-based health-services organization that has provided care for low-income and uninsured families since 1963, found that Medicaid expansion for Texas residents will not only benefit the state’s uninsured but also the hospitals that serve them and the local governments that support them. This is because hospitals and local governments spend far more on piecemeal health care for low-income people than the state will be expected to pay for the Medicaid expansion.</p>
<p>What’s more, under the ACA, hospitals will receive a lower disproportionate share of hospital payments because the health care law assumed the expanded Medicaid program would cover low-income Americans. Without the Medicaid expansion, which is designed to offset these cuts, hospitals in states that don’t expand will be financially strained.</p>
<p>Robin Bachman, assistant vice president of government affairs and public policy at Sisters of Charity Health System, a nonprofit Catholic health system that operates a medical center in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, has also expressed concern about the loss of federal funding without the expansion of Medicaid in her state. “If the General Assembly does not expand Medicaid,” she said, “they are making it much harder for us to do our work.”</p>
<p>Clinics are also facing financial strains due to an increase in demand; there are simply more patients. This increase is due to higher rates of unemployment, with workers having lost their insurance as a result of losing their job, and underemployment, with workers not receiving health insurance in the first place. In Kansas, two faith-based clinics from the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth Health System experienced a 32 percent increase in patient visits last year alone, due mainly to these high rates of unemployment and underemployment. The clinics are hoping the expansion will go into effect in Kansas so that they can support the increased demand for health care.</p>
<p>Across the country, faith-based providers such as the Catholic Health Association, as well as nonprofits that provide care, such as Catholic Charities of Mississippi and Idaho, are actively supporting Medicaid expansion. Jeff Korsmo, president and CEO of Via Christi Health, the largest health care system in Kansas, wrote a column in The Morning Sun saying that the religious founders of the hospital “instilled in our health ministry the moral conviction that every person deserves access to health care” and that Medicaid expansion was both the morally and fiscally right thing to do.</p>

<h3>How faith communities are helping</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Faith leaders have given a voice to important policy issues throughout American history, providing a moral and values framework and calling Americans and their representatives to action when policies do not reflect the nation’s societal values. Once again, faith groups from diverse religious communities are speaking up to raise public awareness about the Medicaid expansion.</p>
<h3>Giving visibility to the issue and articulating the value</h3>
<p>Last September more than 100 faith leaders sent a public letter to governors in seven states, urging them to expand Medicaid. Rev. Jennifer Butler, executive director of Faith in Public Life and one of the signatories, said, “It’s unconscionable that politicians would even consider refusing to accept” the expansion since it will “save lives and alleviate suffering for poor families without straining state budgets.”</p>
<p>Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of NETWORK, a national Catholic social justice lobby, and organizer of “Nuns on the Bus,” a tour that called for an economy for the 100 percent, called Medicaid expansion “a pro-life stance” because it assists low-income Americans in all stages of life. A <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> study found that the adult death rate dropped by 6 percent in states that have already expanded Medicaid. Similar to the earlier bus tour, the Catholic sisters are now touring states by bus to call for a health care system that includes all Americans. “We are all our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers,” said Sister Mary Ellen Lacy of NETWORK. She believes it is important to ignite a national conversation that will spur Americans to hold governors responsible for their decisions.</p>
<h3>Educating local communities about state programs</h3>
<p>A significant hurdle to the successful implementation of several components of the Affordable Care Act is the lack of public awareness about the benefits of those components, including Medicaid expansion. Even though it has been more than three years since the Affordable Care Act became law, for instance, two-thirds of uninsured adults say they do not know what it means for them, according to a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. As community educators and conveners, faith leaders and advocates are using their institutional resources and prominent voices to share information about health care reform with their congregants and communities.</p>
<p>Faith leaders have disseminated information through congregational newsletters and pamphlets, information sessions at support groups and adult education classes, healing and spiritual services, and other meetings. This is not a new role for faith leaders, who have long engaged in educational campaigns around health care and prevention, such as smoking, heart disease, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS.</p>
<div>
<p>In Illinois, the Campaign for Better Health Care last year trained 32 faith leaders on the health care law, focusing especially on the new state exchanges and Medicaid expansion. These leaders are now raising awareness and disseminating information within their congregations. The Campaign for Better Health Care also supports an annual faith campaign called “Sound the Alarm,” which aims to raise awareness on matters of health care justice. This year more than 150 congregations participated by ringing bells or playing other instruments relevant to their religious services and preaching sermons, holding vigils, sponsoring forums, and circulating church bulletins that included information about the state exchange program and Medicaid expansion.</p>
<p>Faith leaders are also teaming up with health care and advocacy organizations such as Families USA and Raising Women’s Voices. These groups provide state-based resources through reports and educational forums to spell out the benefits of Medicaid expansion, including how many dollars the state can save by instituting it. These collaborations equip faith leaders with the knowledge and resources to supplement their moral arguments with medical and economic information.</p>
<h3>Coming together across faiths for state-level action</h3>
<p>Faith communities are joining across denominations and faith traditions to urge their state legislators to expand Medicaid. National groups such as NETWORK, the National Council of Jewish Women, and Faithful Reform have provided toolkits or other support to local leaders. Because each state has its own political landscape and will be uniquely affected by the expansion, however, local groups are leading on-the-ground advocacy efforts.</p>
<p>Through public sign-on letters, meetings with elected officials, vigils, and public rallies, local leaders are banding together to make the moral case for the expansion. Missouri Faith Voices, a statewide network of 200 congregations and faith-based community organizations, has made the Medicaid expansion a key component of its work. More than 200 clergy from within the network met with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) and 80 state legislators to discuss the theological roots and community impacts of the potential expansion. Later, after an unsuccessful meeting with Sen. Kurt Schaefer (R), clergy published an open letter and pressed for a meeting with the editorial board of <em>The Columbia Daily Tribune</em> to continue to push for the expansion.</p>
<p>Other groups have used advocacy days and rallies to reach lawmakers. In South Carolina, the South Carolina Christian Action Council, which represents 1 million churchgoers, organized an advocacy day to urge Gov. Nikki Haley (R) to expand Medicaid. In Oklahoma, an ecumenical group of faith leaders have participated in rallies and news conferences at the state capitol to urge Gov. Mary Fallin (R) to reconsider her decision to refuse these federal funds. In Tennessee, Clergy for Tolerance delivered baskets of loaves of bread and fish to legislators, a symbol of the story of Jesus feeding the masses when there was barely enough for a few. Rev. Thomas Kleinert, senior minister of Vine Street Christian Church in Nashville and a member of the group, believes the opportunity for thousands of Tennesseans to gain access to health care is the opportunity to “strengthen the fabric of our families and communities.” According to Kleinert, “We aren’t called to be miracle workers who do wonders with scarce resources; rather we are called to fully participate in the ongoing miracle of overflowing divine generosity and human community.”</p>
<div>
<h3>Success stories from the states</h3>
<p>Since the 2012 elections, eight Republican governors—in Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, New Jersey, North Dakota, Michigan, Florida, and Ohio—have broken from the mold and thrown their support behind the program. Gov. Chris Christie (R-NJ) said the choice to accept the Medicaid expansion was simple. “We are putting people first,” said Christie. “We have an opportunity to ensure that even a greater number of New Jerseyans who are at or near the poverty line will have access to critical health services beginning in January 2014.”</p>
<p>Many Americans, including representatives, have been moved by the moral call for the expansion. In New Mexico, the New Mexico Conference of Catholic Bishops, the New Mexico Conference of Churches, Lutheran Advocacy Ministry, and Comunidades en Acción y de Fé, joined a coalition of 50 secular community and health organizations to urge Gov. Susan Martinez (R) to expand Medicaid. In January Gov. Martinez announced that her state would participate in the program, potentially extending health coverage to nearly 170,000 low-income uninsured New Mexicans.</p>
<p>Similar victories have been won in Colorado and Arizona, where faith leaders organized by Together Colorado and the PICO National Network, a national network of faith-based community organizations, joined advocates to call for Medicaid expansion. Both states have plans to expand their Medicaid programs; Gov. Jan Brewer (R-AZ) even defended her decision by arguing its moral importance.</p>
<h3>More work needs to be done</h3>
<p>Where state lawmakers or legislatures continue to oppose the expansion of Medicaid, faith-based groups are continuing their fight by linking moral arguments with the financial incentives for the expansion.</p>
<div>
<p>In Ohio, for example, faith leaders won a significant victory, gaining Republican Gov. John Kasich’s support for Medicaid expansion by articulating the moral imperative of the program. In his State of the State address, Gov. Kasich cited his Christian beliefs as one of the reasons for his support of the expansion, saying, “I can’t look at the disabled, I can’t look at the poor, I can’t look at the mentally ill, I can’t look at the addicted and think we ought to ignore them.” Gov. Kasich, however, failed to gain enough support among his fellow GOP legislators to support the expansion. Faith groups across the state, such as BREAD, the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, Greater Cleveland Congregations, the Ohio Council of Churches, and PICO groups, have continued to put pressure on legislators, joining with the larger campaign for Medicaid expansion, the Ohio Alliance for Health Transformation, to merge a moral argument with the financial argument.</p>
<p>Tracey Lind, dean of Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Cleveland and co-chair of Greater Cleveland Congregations, a coalition of 40 religious groups that has called on the state to expand Medicaid, believes the financial implications and the moral value of the expansion go hand in hand. She believes it is important that the state does not lose out on the billions of tax dollars that will be spent in the state. “I think fiscal responsibility is another word for stewardship,” said Lind. “And I believe there is a moral imperative. I think it’s fiscal irresponsibility not to participate.” Medicaid expansion would extend health care coverage to 684,000 Ohioans and provide more than $53 billion in federal dollars, increasing not only health care coverage but also jobs and tax revenue for the state. Faith leaders in Ohio have been working to educate the public and their legislatures about these financial incentives through private meetings, public letters, and rallies.</p>
<p>Ohio faith leaders are not the only ones touting the impact of Medicaid expansion by the dollars saved by state and local communities. In Virginia, faith leaders are sharing a study by the Commonwealth Institute that found the state can make the Medicaid expansion pay for itself, netting $555 million over the next eight years. In Texas, Dallas Area Interfaith often explains the Medicaid expansion program as a return of tax dollars to state and local communities, and that to reject the expansion is to give Texas money to the federal government, a framing that resonates with many in the state.</p>
<p>In Oklahoma, the financial argument has been an important piece of faith leaders’ organizing efforts. Rev. Stan Basler of Oklahoma City stressed the importance of both the financial argument and the moral argument in a NewsOK op-ed last April:</p>
<blockquote><p>The choice is between sustaining the lives of the poor versus speculation about financial sustainability three years from now. In the meantime the health care-related economy should grow and nonurban medical care will be bolstered. Most importantly, lives will be saved, as will the dignity of the poor and working poor.</p></blockquote>

<div>
<h3>Moving forward</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Faith communities across the country are engaged on the issue of Medicaid expansion because it will impact their congregants and communities. But these faith communities and their leaders are not losing hope.</p>
<p>Because a state can join the Medicaid expansion program at any time in the future, advocates have vowed to continue to organize until their legislatures support the expansion. Successful advocacy efforts this year are models for other states that continue to push for reform.</p>
<p>Where secular advocates have united with faith leaders to ensure that legislatures are educated about the financial incentives, and where citizens are made aware of the health benefits as well as the moral injustice of denying low-income workers and families access to care, coalitions have been able to build strong movements in support of the expansion.</p>

<blockquote><p>The House Republican education bill fails to ensure that our nation’s children are prepared for college, careers, and future success. The bill does not require states to set goals for student performance or require states to measure student growth—key components for creating an education system that promotes equality and high expectations. The bill also tragically undermines the historic federal role our education system plays in promoting a level playing field for students by maintaining a loophole in the law that leads to providing less rather than more funding to schools  and students that need additional support. As a result, students of color and low-income students are being shortchanged. ESEA reauthorization is an unprecedented opportunity to ensure that we provide the resources needed to help all students succeed and to ensure that federal tax dollars are tied to results.</p>
<p>Our nation cannot afford to walk away from its commitment to the very students who need the most support. Now is the time to move our education system forward and ensure academic and future success for all students.</p></blockquote>

Cassidy’s description, while clever, is old news.</p>
<p>Longtime Republican staffer Mike Lofgren came clean two years ago about his former party being “<a href="http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/3079-goodbye-to-all-that-reflections-of-a-gop-operative-who-left-the-cult">full of lunatics</a>.” Not long afterward, longtime nonpartisan political analysts Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann pronounced the GOP to be “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/lets-just-say-it-the-republicans-are-the-problem/2012/04/27/gIQAxCVUlT_story.html?tid=pm_opinions_pop">ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise</a>; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/liberals-and-conservatives-dont-just-vote-differently-they-think-differently/2012/04/12/gIQAzb1kDT_story.html">unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science</a>; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.” And yet this essential fact, which defines almost all of the parameters of our political discourse, routinely goes unmentioned in the mainstream media’s political coverage—even when it is absolutely central to the story being written.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/paul-farhi/2011/03/08/ABO2YCP_page.html">Paul Farhi</a>’s 1,800-word <em>Washington Post</em> article titled, “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/billionaire-koch-brothers-use-web-to-take-on-media-reports-they-dispute/2013/07/14/6a0953a0-e5b5-11e2-a11e-c2ea876a8f30_story.html">Billionaire Koch brothers use Web to take on media reports they dispute</a>.” In it, the author attempts to characterize the conservative billionaire brothers’ energetic efforts to blunt reporters’ stories they would have preferred had not been written. But nowhere in the piece does Farhi take a position on whether the reporters’ or the Koch brothers’ complaints are more accurate. Repeatedly, the authors of the Koch brothers’ critique insist that respected journalists, including especially <em>The New Yorker’s</em> Jane Mayer, “Distorts the Facts and Misleads Readers …” (in the words of a Koch Facts blog post). But as the <em>Columbia Journalism Review’s</em> Dean Starkman aptly notes, in a post called “<a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/on_koch_vs_the_media_he_said-s.php">On Koch vs. journalists: he said-she said</a>,” “the <em>Post</em> piece treats the matter as though it were a tennis match, a he said/she said affair, without getting into the key question: did the outlets actually make fact[ual] errors?”<strong></strong></p>
<p>No facts are actually cited in the piece. Anyone who is remotely familiar with <em>The</em> <em>New Yorker’s</em> incredible fact-checking efforts would have a hard time imagining that the Koch brothers’ website could improve on them. And yet the facts—or even the lack of any evidence supporting the Koch brothers’ position—are deemed irrelevant by the reporter for the sake of the battle. Nor does he mention that the brothers routinely deny the existence of man-made global warming and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/07/the-kochs-and-the-action-on-global-warming.html">fund a healthy portion of those in politics and the media who take this anti-science position as well</a>.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Farhi makes note of the fact that, “When Mayer’s article became a finalist for a National Magazine Award in early 2011, Koch Industries took the unusual step of writing to the award’s sponsor, the American Society of Magazine Editors,” to object. “Her article is ideologically slanted and a prime example of a disturbing trend in journalism, where agenda-driven advocacy masquerades as objective reporting,” wrote Koch attorney Mark V. Holden <a href="http://www.kochfacts.com/kf/letter-to-american-society-of-magazine-editors-objecting-to-new-yorker-magazine-recognition/">in his letter, which was posted on Koch Facts</a>. “Given these facts, it would be inappropriate for ASME to give Ms. Mayer’s article an award in Reporting.” Fahri then explains, “Mayer was not selected for the reporting award that year.”</p>
<p>All true, but also misleading. I happen to be a member of the jury for that very award. The competition was intense—Michael Hastings’ incredible reporting on Gen. Stanley McChrystal, “<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-runaway-general-20100622">The Runaway General</a>” also did not win—but Mayer came as close to winning as an entrant could without actually winning. To Fahri’s implication above, however, the Koch brothers’ complaint was sent long after the final vote had been taken, so it could not have affected the award.</p>
<p>This same unwillingness to face up to the fundamental facts regarding the Republican Party can also be seen in recent coverage of the so-called “nuclear-option” battle in the Senate.</p>
<p>Mainstream superstars such as <em>Time’s</em> <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1950070_1950063_1950067,00.html">Mark Halperin</a> and <em>The New York Times’</em> <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/174051/modo#ixzz2ZDj39yDS">Maureen Dowd</a> consistently complain that President Barack Obama has not done enough to force the Republicans to behave sensibly, without ever explaining how this might be done. David Brooks even complained in one column that President Obama should stop being such a “meanie” to Republicans by devoting himself to issues such as the economy where he knows the Republicans cannot help but take positions that “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/opinion/brooks-the-next-four-years.html?hp&amp;_r=0">make them look like wackos</a>.”</p>
<p>Some of those “wacko” positions might have been relevant to the reasons that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and the Democrats felt compelled to threaten a change in the Senate rules on official confirmations. Among them, as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/16/wonkbook-10-facts-that-explain-the-filibuster-fight/?hpid=z9">Ezra Klein and Evan Soltas</a> note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before President Obama took office, 20 executive-branch nominees were filibustered. Under the Obama administration, 16 have been filibustered.</li>
<li>Former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson faced one filibuster. Sen. Harry Reid has faced more than 400.</li>
<li>Republicans aren’t just trying to block nominees; they’re also trying to nullify or change agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet you won’t find any mention of the above in yesterday’s front-page <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/16/us/politics/democrats-seeing-precedent-press-on-to-curb-filibuster.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;ref=politics"><em>New York Times</em> story</a> or in the lead story on <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/senate-nears-nuclear-option-showdown-94156.html#ixzz2ZDmCAJa6">Politico&#8217;s website</a>. According to Rupert Murdoch’s <em>New York Post</em>,<strong> </strong>Sen. Reid was &#8220;<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/07/16/ny-post-sen-reid-sounding-like-dr-strangelove-f/194900">sounding like Dr. Strangelove</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who, after all, are the journalists representing here? Do they feel they need to be fair to views that are put forth entirely cynically or views based on nothing more than ideology when compared to those that at least make a modicum of sense? Even with this false balance, after all, the American public does not share their commitment to baseless “on-the-one-handism.” According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, 51 percent of voters believe gridlock is primarily the result of Republican recalcitrance. Just 35 percent blamed it on President Obama&#8217;s lack of &#8220;personal skills to convince leaders of Congress to work together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much the same can be said about Mark Leibovich’s terrific new book about Washington politics, titled <em>This Town</em>. It tells you almost everything you need to know about Washington except what is most important. For instance, in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/magazine/how-to-win-in-washington.html?pagewanted=all">this lengthy excerpt dealing with Rep. Darrell Issa’s (R-CA) former aide, Kurt Bardella</a>, nowhere do we learn of the <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/the-charade-of-darrell-issa/">foolishness and extremism</a> of the causes into which this allegedly “not much of a true believer in any political cause” threw himself, as if the substance were of no consequence whatsoever.</p>
<p>Mainstream media’s stubborn refusal to face this elephant in room not only purposely misinforms, but it also can actually cost lives. Yet over and over again, top media outlets take no responsibility for allowing their employees and politicians to mislead the public with discredited views, even in matters of public health. ABC just took a step in this dangerous direction with its announcement that it would hire Jenny McCarthy for its program “The View.” McCarthy, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/07/jenny-mccarthys-dangerous-views.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Michael Specter</a> notes, “ has spent much of the past ten years campaigning against vaccines—which, it must be said, are the most effective instruments of public health in human history, aside from clean water,” and adding that “ She is not subtle … When people disagree with her views on television, McCarthy has been known to refute scientific data by shouting ‘bullshit.’” What is the journalist’s responsibility here? Here is ABC News icon Barbara Walters on the announcement of the news: McCarthy, she says, &#8220;offers a fresh point of view.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder how many children will contract avoidable diseases because they trusted ABC not to give a daily podium to proven quacks—just as I wonder how many young girls did not get vaccinated for the HPV disease because of Rep. Michele Bachmann’s crackpot opinion, repeatedly stated on television and elsewhere, that it could lead to <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/16/michele-bachmann/bachmann-hpv-vaccine-cause-mental-retardation/">mental retardation</a>. And I wonder what business the people who make these decisions think they’re in. It certainly isn’t that of informing the public.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/7">Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act</a>, or DOMA, allows U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, to recognize that a same-sex marriage between a citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident and a noncitizen valid in the state where it was celebrated is sufficient to confer immigration benefits. Under DOMA, federal agencies such as USCIS were required to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman, preventing same-sex couples from accessing <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2013/06/10/65846/marriage-equality-and-the-supreme-court/">more than 1,000</a> federal programs and benefits available to opposite-sex couples.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2013/06/26/68033/what-the-doma-decision-means-for-lgbt-binational-couples/">earlier column</a>, we detailed how the Court’s historic ruling would aid lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, or LGBT, U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents, or LPRs, in obtaining immigration visas for their spouses and preventing the separation of their families. While sponsorship for immigration visas is an important benefit and is critical for preserving family unity, it is not the only federal benefit to which LGBT binational families now have access. Other key immigration benefits now available to LGBT binational couples include sponsorship of a spouse’s children and protection of domestic violence survivors from deportation, among others. We detail these newfound protections and benefits below.</p>

<p>Under the new compromise plan, interest rates on both subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans to undergraduate students would be tied to market rates with an add-on of 2.05 percent. Rates on these loans would be set at the time the loan is taken out, fixed for the duration of the loan, and capped at 8.25 percent to guard against future increases in market rates. The plan takes a similar approach to Stafford loans for graduate students, which would have a 3.6 percent add-on and a cap of 9.5 percent, and PLUS loans, which would have a 4.6 percent add-on and a 10.5 percent cap.</p>
<p><strong>Carmel Martin</strong>, Executive Vice President for Policy at the Center for American Progress, released the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are encouraged by the efforts of a bipartisan group in the Senate to reverse the doubling of interest rates that took effect on July 1, providing relief to millions of students who rely on federal loans to pay for college. There is no better investment we can make as a nation. The compromise also puts in place a framework that will ensure that future borrowers are not exploited by the student-loan program by charging interest rates that have no relationship to rates paid by consumers in the market. There is much more work to be done to ensure that all students in America can afford a college education, but keeping rates manageable is the least we can do to keep college affordable and reduce the burden of student debt.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Anne Johnson</strong>, Director of Generation Progress, released the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the millions of young Americans and families worried about how they’ll pay for college this fall, today’s student-loan deal in the Senate is long overdue. After a frustrating political back-and-forth, Democrats and Republicans have come together to put college affordability first and give families the peace of mind they need.  The deal, while not perfect, will protect future borrowers against rate spikes and lower rates immediately for the 11 million students and families who count on federal student loans to help pay for college. Our work on addressing the more than $1.2 trillion in student-loan debt is not done, but today’s deal is a critical step, and we urge Congress to move quickly to get this done.</p></blockquote>

<p>The U.S. Census projects that by 2043, people of color will comprise the majority of the population in our nation. Yet today, the communities that are growing fastest are being left behind in a number of economic and social indicators, and not positioned to reach their full potential. What are the implications for our economy as these populations grow? What needs to happen to ensure opportunity for all? And how do we jumpstart a national dialogue about the economic imperative of closing racial gaps for the sake of our collective future?</p>
<p>Please join the Center for American Progress and PolicyLink for the release of their new publication <em>All-In Nation: An America that Works for All</em>, a book that examines the shifting demographics, equity, and the future of the American economy.</p>
<p><em>All-In Nation</em> makes the case that as our nation undergoes profound demographic shifts, it is more urgent than ever to ensure everyone can participate and prosper, not only because it is a moral imperative but because it is in our economic interest as well. The book presents new analysis demonstrating that racial inclusion would strengthen America’s economy in the short and the long term as well as providing a blueprint for creating a more equitable economy and nation.</p>

Terrill</p><p class="photocaption">Pastor Charles Blake lll, left, greets Tracy Martin, center, and Sybrina Fulton, the parents of shooting victim Trayvon Martin, during a rally on behalf of Trayvon's family, Thursday, April 26, 2012, in Los Angeles, California. </p><p>One of the more riveting images to appear last year after George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon Martin was <a href="http://bigsole.blogspot.com/2013/07/in-pictures-trayvon-martin-photoshopped.html">side-by-side photos</a> of the two young men, altered to make Zimmerman appear black and Martin appear white and asking how those changes would have affected public perceptions of the shooting. Some of the more memorable comments after the shooting involved race reversals as well. In the months following Trayvon’s death, several commentators wondered why a black guy in a hoodie signaled danger, while a white guy in a hoodie signaled Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.</p>
<p>Now that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/15/us/george-zimmerman-verdict-trayvon-martin.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;">Zimmerman has been acquitted</a> of second-degree murder and manslaughter, those images and comments are resurfacing as a stark reminder of the impact race has on our perceptions, actions, and laws. Despite claims to be a society that rewards merit and hard work regardless of skin color—as well as one that metes out justice in a fair and impartial way and values all of its citizens—the difficult truth is that race still matters very much in America. People with dark skin—especially young black men—are too often viewed for no good reason with distrust, suspicion, and disdain. For Trayvon Martin, walking home after dark got him killed.</p>
<p>A friend warned me that writing such words would close white ears. “White people don’t like to feel guilty about race,” he said. “Nobody wants to be called a bigot.” I suspect he’s right. But nobody wants to get stopped, frisked, or shot while going about his or her business either.</p>
<p>We have got to get over our racial sensitivities and denials, as well as our resistance to addressing the biases and assumptions that fuel and sustain racial injustice in America today. An essay in <em>Ebony</em> last year, “<a href="http://www.ebony.com/news-views/dear-white-folks-black-people-are-sensitive-to-race-so-and-what#axzz2Z94UnDVM">Dear White Folks: Black People are Sensitive to Race,</a>” spelled out about a dozen ways in which black people are routinely inconvenienced, harassed, threatened, insulted, intimidated, ignored, or harmed simply because they are black. Such matters of safety and fear are known in a visceral way by most black Americans, no matter how much money they make. They are a part of daily life and shape the way that parents raise their children, as they seek to protect them from the serious harm that could come to them simply because of their skin color.</p>
<p>In terms of the Trayvon Martin case, one can point to the <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/blogs/tv-guy/os-george-zimmerman-star-prosecutor-weak-case-20130712,0,2868933.post">weakness of the prosecution</a>, the broad nature of the <a href="http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/why-stand-your-ground-is-really-kill-at-will/">&#8220;Stand Your Ground” law</a>, or any number of additional factors that contributed to Zimmerman’s acquittal. But race was certainly a part of it. If Zimmerman had been black and Martin had been white, the entire narrative of the case—as well as the verdict—would have been different.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the day after the verdict, many churches were filled with sermons, tears, prayers, and calls to action. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/14/trayvon-martin-hoodie-sunday_n_3594302.html">Rev. Mike McBride</a>, pastor of The Way Christian Center in West Berkeley, California, and director of the <a href="http://www.lifelinestohealing.org/">Lifelines to Healing Campaign</a> of the <a href="http://www.piconetwork.org/">PICO National Network,</a> preached about the mutilation, hurt, and pain of black bodies but also of the good news and healing power that can make us whole. “The role of faith is to open the possibility of redemption in the lives of those that are broken,” McBride said in an interview with <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/14/trayvon-martin-hoodie-sunday_n_3594302.html">The Huffington Post</a>, “and I want to challenge our congregations to step into that role.” In addition to preaching, McBride is organizing and training his congregation in direct action to help prevent gun and urban violence.</p>
<p>America is a nation where more than <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/147887/americans-continue-believe-god.aspx">9 out of 10 people</a> believe in God. And God does not play favorites. We are all equally precious in God’s sight, whether we have won a Nobel Prize or receive unemployment benefits. God weeps as much for a child killed by gunfire in a park in Chicago as for President John F. Kennedy gunned down in a motorcade in Dallas.</p>
<p>What we need most today is “<a href="http://www.kirkcenter.org/index.php/detail/the-moral-imagination/">moral imagination</a>”—an intuitive empathy that transcends personal experience. It comes first—before changed policies, politics, or laws. In fact, it makes those changes possible. The writer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/books/review/marilynne-robinsons-when-i-was-a-child-i-read-books.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">Marilynne Robinson</a> calls this capacity “imaginative love,” saying that it spurs us to love “people we do not know or whom we know very slightly.” When we get outside of our own skin and transcend our narrow boundaries, we discover lives different from our own, as well as deep connections with so-called strangers.</p>
<p>Such efforts are not merely the feel-good actions of faith communities. In an increasingly diverse society, they are the essential work of all of us. We all need to overcome our hardened assumptions about those who appear different. We need to widen our circle of human concern and community. Stretching our moral imagination means seeking to grasp what it is like to be a black man in America today—the vulnerability and fear that may come from simply being alive. Opening our minds to that knowledge and our hearts to those insights is the necessary and right thing to do.</p>

Popov, who is a Bulgarian graduate student, and Marsh, a U.S. citizen, are the first gay couple in the nation to have their application for immigration benefits approved after the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriages, their lawyer says.</p><p>The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/7">Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act</a>, or DOMA, allows U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, to recognize that a same-sex marriage between a citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident and a noncitizen valid in the state where it was celebrated is sufficient to confer immigration benefits. Under DOMA, federal agencies such as USCIS were required to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman, preventing same-sex couples from accessing <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2013/06/10/65846/marriage-equality-and-the-supreme-court/">more than 1,000</a> federal programs and benefits available to opposite-sex couples.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2013/06/26/68033/what-the-doma-decision-means-for-lgbt-binational-couples/">earlier column</a>, we detailed how the Court’s historic ruling would aid lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, or LGBT, U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents, or LPRs, in obtaining immigration visas for their spouses and preventing the separation of their families. While sponsorship for immigration visas is an important benefit and is critical for preserving family unity, it is not the only federal benefit to which LGBT binational families now have access. Other key immigration benefits now available to LGBT binational couples include sponsorship of a spouse’s children and protection of domestic violence survivors from deportation, among others. We detail these newfound protections and benefits below.</p>
<h3>Sponsoring stepchildren</h3>
<p>Family reunification is one of the hallmarks of our immigration system. To promote family reunification, immigration law grants preferential treatment to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1151">immediate relatives</a> of U.S. citizens, which allows them to legally enter and remain in the United States. “Immediate relatives” for immigration purposes include <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1151">children, spouses, and parents</a> of a citizen of the United States. Under DOMA, however, LGBT binational families were at risk of separation since the law prevented recognition of their marriages and, in turn, prevented them from accessing these sponsorship benefits provided to other families.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens and LPRs are eligible to bring their unmarried children who are under 21 years of age to the United States. Immigration law employs terms <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101">such as “born in wedlock,” “adoption,” and “stepchild” </a> to define recognized parent-child relationships. Prior to the Supreme Court’s removal of Section 3 of DOMA, the definition of family for immigration purposes assumed all families were comprised of married heterosexual couples raising biological or adopted children. But LGBT families are formed in <a href="http://www.lgbtmap.org/file/all-children-matter-full-report.pdf">myriad</a> ways. The children in these families may have been adopted or may be the biological children of only one spouse. The children may also have been born through artificial insemination or surrogacy. In some instances, <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2012/07/17/11855/securing-legal-ties-for-children-living-in-lgbt-families/">state laws may not recognize</a> the relationships between these children and both of their parents. Under DOMA, the U.S. citizen or LPR spouse who was not biologically related to the child or on the adoption forms was not able to have his or her relationship to the child recognized under immigration law because his or her marriage was not recognized by the federal government.</p>
<p>Family reunification provisions are important for binational LGBT couples, especially since <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/LGBTImmigrants-Gates-Mar-2013.pdf">47 percent</a> of same-sex couples that include one noncitizen and one naturalized citizen are raising children, and a <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/LGBTImmigrants-Gates-Mar-2013.pdf">quarter</a> of binational same-sex couples that include one native-born citizen are raising children. Under DOMA, the “born in wedlock” category could not be applied to children of LGBT binational couples because, while adopted children are recognized in immigration law, <a href="http://www.familyequality.org/get_informed/equality_maps/step-parent_adoption_laws/">many states</a> do not permit LGBT couples to adopt. In cases where the foreign spouse had biological children and the U.S. citizen or LPR lived in a state where he or she could not legally adopt them, the U.S. citizen spouse or LPR was unable to apply for immigration benefits for the children because they were not recognized as belonging to the citizen or LPR.</p>
<p>Now that the federal government can recognize same-sex marriages, LGBT binational families have access to the same family-reunification immigration benefits as other families. With the demise of Section 3 of DOMA, U.S. citizens and LPRs who file an application for lawful permanent residence for a spouse can also do so for the spouse’s children as their own <a href="http://immigrationequality.org/2013/06/the-end-of-doma-what-your-family-needs-to-know/">stepchildren</a>.</p>
<h3>Protecting domestic violence survivors from deportation</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113s47enr/pdf/BILLS-113s47enr.pdf">The Violence Against Women Act</a>, or VAWA, allows certain categories of abused immigrant spouses and their children to self-petition for permanent residency in the United States and receive employment authorization and public benefits. This provision recognizes the fact that an immigrant without legal immigration status in the United States may be reluctant to leave his or her abuser due to fear of deportation. VAWA provides survivors with a means of escaping violence and establishing safe and independent lives.</p>
<p>The 2013 reauthorization of VAWA recognizes that LGBT couples are unfortunately not immune to domestic violence and included <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/14/living/same-sex-domestic-violence-and-vawa">expanded services for LGBT survivors of domestic violence</a>. It did not, however, extend the immigration protections available to abused spouses in same-sex relationships because its use of the term “spouse” was restricted to opposite-sex couples by Section 3 of DOMA.</p>
<p>With the fall of Section 3, VAWA’s definition of spouse is expanded to cover LGBT couples. LGBT abused spouses and children of U.S. citizens and LPRs are therefore now eligible to remain in the United States even after leaving their abusers. Furthermore, abused LGBT spouses of U.S. citizens or LPRs and their unmarried children under 21 years of age may qualify for permanent residency under VAWA, even if the children <a href="http://www.immigrantjustice.org/sites/immigrantjustice.org/files/VAWA%20Pro%20Bono%20Manual%202011.04.pdf">are not related</a> to the abusive U.S. citizen or LPR. The nonabused same-sex spouse of a U.S. citizen or LPR whose child is abused by the U.S. citizen or LPR spouse may qualify as well—even if the child is not related to the U.S. citizen or LPR abuser.</p>
<h3>Admitting fiancé(e)s of U.S. citizens and their children</h3>
<p>Another immigration benefit that same-sex couples can now access is the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=fcf75b836ea73210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=3d7fa6c515083210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD">K visa</a>, which allows fiancé(e)s and their unmarried minor children of U.S. citizens to legally enter the United States so they can be together and married within 90 days of admission. It also allows the fiancé(e) to immediately apply for work authorization. Once married, the foreign citizen is eligible to adjust his or her status to become an LPR.</p>
<p>K visas were introduced to prevent lengthy separation of engaged couples and to promote family unification. Now that Section 3 of DOMA has been repealed, LGBT binational couples can be together even before their wedding. This allows them the opportunity to not only be legally married in the United States among their friends and family but also gives them time to be together in the United States for up to three months before the actual wedding so they can plan the event and care for their children.</p>
<h3>Recognizing follow-to-join benefits</h3>
<p>Some LGBT Lawful Permanent Residents who were married or had children before becoming LPRs and whose spouses or children did not accompany them to the United States are now eligible for <a href="http://www.immihelp.com/greencard/familybasedimmigration/following-to-join-benefits.html">follow-to-join benefits</a>. Follow-to-join benefits mean that the spouse or children who did not physically accompany the LPR to the United States do not have to <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=10093e4d77d73210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=10093e4d77d73210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD">wait any extra time</a> for a visa number to become available. Instead, the LPR simply must notify a U.S. consulate that he or she is an LPR so the spouse can apply for an immigrant visa. With the repeal of Section 3 of DOMA, the marriages of same-sex couples are recognized by USCIS, and LGBT families can now be expeditiously reunited.</p>
<h3>Allowing undocumented spouses to apply for a hardship waiver</h3>
<p>People unlawfully in the United States must first leave the country before they are eligible to apply for a green card. <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-2006.html">Immigration law</a> bars spouses and children of U.S. citizens who have been in the United States without authorization from being legally admitted to the country as an LPR for either 3 years or 10 years, depending on how long they were in the country before leaving and whether they left voluntarily or were deported before applying for LPR status. Unless these immigrants first obtain a hardship waiver, they must wait a specified number of years before getting a green card.</p>
<p>Hardship waivers lessen the amount of time an undocumented immigrant must wait before applying to be an LPR and are only available for immigrants who are the spouse or child of a U.S. citizen. Before DOMA fell, undocumented LGBT immigrants married to U.S. citizens were ineligible for a waiver to shorten the time before they were eligible to reunite with their families in the United States and become LPRs. Now that marriage between LGBT undocumented immigrants and U.S. citizens or LPRs is recognized, these couples are eligible to apply for a hardship waiver.</p>
<p>Furthermore, beginning in <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=bc41875decf56310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=bc41875decf56310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD">March 2013</a>, USCIS began to allow hardship applications to be adjudicated in the United States, shortening the time that an immigrant is separated from his or her family in the United States by allowing individuals to remain in the country while USCIS makes a decision on the waiver. With the fall of Section 3, LGBT undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens or LPRs are now separated from their families for a shorter period of time while applying for an immigrant visa that allows them to be reunited with their families.</p>
<h3>What removing Section 3 didn’t fix</h3>
<p>While the fall of Section 3 of DOMA has made numerous immigration benefits accessible to LGBT families, there are still some families left out.</p>
<p>These benefits are only for LGBT couples that are legally married. Those who do not live in states where marriage-equality legislation has passed and are unable to travel to states that recognize same-sex marriage to get married—including couples in civil unions or domestic partnerships—are unable to benefit from these provisions. This is an important reason why it is critical to pass <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Post-DOMA_General_v2.pdf">marriage-equality legislation</a> in all 50 states and on the federal level: All same-sex couples will be able to enjoy equal protection under the law, regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>LGBT asylum seekers are also likely to have come from countries that do not recognize same-sex marriage since persecution based on sexual orientation is the essence of their claims. As such, they would not come to the United States already married to their LGBT partner and are ineligible to petition to bring their partners over as derivatives. With the removal of Section 3 of DOMA, however, their partners should be eligible for a K visa, as discussed above.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The repeal of Section 3 of DOMA is certainly a step in the right direction, but Congress and the Obama administration should work together in the coming months to ensure these civil rights and protections are afforded to all married couples living in America. As long as same-sex marriages are not recognized in <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/press/statement/2011/07/19/15672/statement-caps-winnie-stachelberg-applauds-white-house-endorsement-of-respect-for-marriage-act/">all 50 states</a>, same-sex binational couples will be at risk of separation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the Supreme Court’s decision fixed a number of issues for LGBT immigrants married to U.S. citizens and LPRs, including providing a pathway to citizenship for the estimated <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2013/06/26/68033/what-the-doma-decision-means-for-lgbt-binational-couples/">24,700</a> LGBT binational couples in the United States, there are still more than a <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/report/2013/03/08/55674/living-in-dual-shadows/">quarter of a million</a> undocumented LGBT immigrants waiting for Congress to pass common-sense immigration reform that will allow them to come out of the shadows and have a clear and direct pathway to citizenship.</p>

<p>The curious case of Edward Snowden’s stay in the Sheremetyevo airport transit zone in Russia has highlighted both the promise of U.S.-Russian security relations and their limitations.</p>
<p>Whether the issue is extraditing Snowden, or tackling more significant concerns such as political transition in Syria or nuclear arms reductions, Russian cooperation would be of great benefit to the United States in matters of national and international security.</p>
<p>But there is only so much the United States can do to turn the potential for Russian cooperation into practice. Russian authorities often have interests that militate against cooperation, interests that the United States is unwilling or unable to counter.</p>
<p>At the same time, the United States needs to keep the significance of Russian intransigence in perspective. While security cooperation with Russia can be valuable, limits to this cooperation are not an overriding obstacle to achieving U.S. objectives; the challenges lie at least as much in the implementation of our own policies. As importantly, efforts to overcome the limits of Russian cooperation need not come at the expense of other aspects of U.S. policy toward Russia.</p>

<p>The curious case of Edward Snowden’s stay in the Sheremetyevo airport transit zone in Russia has highlighted both the promise of U.S.-Russian security relations and their limitations.</p>
<p>Whether the issue is extraditing Snowden, or tackling more significant concerns such as political transition in Syria or nuclear arms reductions, Russian cooperation would be of great benefit to the United States in matters of national and international security.</p>
<p>But there is only so much the United States can do to turn the potential for Russian cooperation into practice. Russian authorities often have interests that militate against cooperation, interests that the United States is unwilling or unable to counter.</p>
<p>At the same time, the United States needs to keep the significance of Russian intransigence in perspective. While security cooperation with Russia can be valuable, limits to this cooperation are not an overriding obstacle to achieving U.S. objectives; the challenges lie at least as much in the implementation of our own policies. As importantly, efforts to overcome the limits of Russian cooperation need not come at the expense of other aspects of U.S. policy toward Russia.</p>
<h3>The Snowden affair</h3>
<p>Edward Snowden is wanted on U.S. federal charges of espionage and theft of government property, but he remains in limbo in a Russian airport. As this story has played out over the past few weeks, one question has dominated U.S.-Russian relations: Will Russia respond positively to the U.S. request to extradite Snowden, or will they grant him asylum?</p>
<p>In an initial television interview, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed the administration’s hope that the Russians would “understand this should not be taken lightly” and “do the right thing.” He said the extradition request was a reasonable one coming from a “partner nation” working with Russia in other security and law enforcement matters. At the same time, increased domestic discontent with Russia’s authoritarian governing system has suggested that the Kremlin might be wary of championing the cause of a government whistleblower, potentially encouraging copycat activity at home.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, quickly dispelled any notion that Russia would deliver Snowden to the United States, stating that the American citizen could remain in transit until he was able to arrange transportation elsewhere. Yet in a nod to Russia’s interest in seeming to be cooperative, Putin downplayed this decision. He expressed hope that it would “not in any way affect our normal business relations with the United States.” He later stated that Snowden should “stop his work aimed at harming our American partners” if he wanted to stay in Russia. Snowden withdrew his asylum application to Russia the next day, although he has since requested “temporary” asylum given the trouble with arranging safe passage to a third country.</p>
<p>The timing of the Snowden affair helps explain Russia’s relatively subdued reaction to Snowden’s asylum case. U.S.-Russian relations hit their lowest point since the August 2008 Russia-Georgia war last winter, when the United States imposed human rights sanctions against Russian officials and Moscow began eliminating a variety of government and civil society linkages to the United States. Since then, relations have been on a mild upswing, reflected in the wide-reaching agenda of President Obama’s two-hour meeting with Putin at the G-8 summit on June 17. The two governments announced new mechanisms for “enhanced” high-level engagement, a bilateral summit in September, an economic dialogue between Vice President Joe Biden and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, and three new cooperative agreements on nuclear nonproliferation, counterterrorism, and cybersecurity confidence-building measures. With U.S.-Russian relations having returned to a more cooperative mode, Moscow does not see fit to openly trumpet the Snowden affair as an anti-American triumph.</p>
<p>Still, Russian authorities have countervailing interests that dictate against extraditing Snowden. They do not wish to appear subservient to Washington in front of domestic or international audiences. They also cannot pass up the opportunity to give the United States—which considers itself a protector of human rights in Russia—a dose of its own medicine.</p>
<p>The Obama administration has taken the Russian response in stride, with the president observing that it is not worth it “to start doing wheeling and dealing and trading on a whole host of other issues simply to get [Snowden] extradited.&#8221;The administration’s response reflects two aspects of U.S.-Russian relations beyond the Snowden affair.</p>
<p>First, there are limits to the United States’ ability to persuade the Russian government to cooperate on all issues. Neither requests, nor deals, nor pleas, nor appeals to interests, reciprocity, or partnership—let alone threats—can guarantee Russian cooperation.</p>
<p>Second, Russia’s stance is not the only barrier. In the case of the Snowden affair, Hong Kong also refused to extradite Snowden, there has been far greater tolerance internationally—and even among the U.S. public—toward Snowden, and Amnesty International even called on governments around the world to reject the extradition requests. At the same time, there has been increasingly less tolerance toward the U.S. government’s own actions, reflected by angry European reactions to alleged National Security Agency, or NSA, spying of European Union offices.</p>
<h3>Ending Syria’s civil war</h3>
<p>This same dynamic is on display in the efforts to end Syria’s civil war.</p>
<p>At the start of the Syria crisis, Russia could have contributed to a resolution if it had voted for U.N. Security Council sanctions against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Even now, it would be helpful if Russia were to openly turn its back on Assad and work alongside the United States and other nations to achieve a transition away from the regime. But Moscow refuses to do so for a variety of reasons, including its aversion to Western-sanctioned overthrows of authoritarian leaders and the conviction that what would follow would be at least as bad as what came before, and likely worse.</p>
<p>Russia’s obstinacy is a source of frustration for the United States and other nations that support a transition away from the Assad regime. But the Obama administration has not treated it as an insurmountable obstacle to achieving political transition. In May the administration acknowledged Russia’s refusal to adopt an openly anti-Assad position and agreed to renew a diplomatic effort to end the conflict by convening a conference, “Geneva II,” bringing together representatives of the regime and opposition forces to negotiate the establishment of a transitional governing body. As Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes explained in a press briefing after the Obama-Putin meeting:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we can get the two parties to the table and help forge a political settlement that allows for a new government to emerge and the conflict to come to an end, that would be our preference, that would be Russia’s preference, and that would be in the best interest of the Syrian people and the international community.</p></blockquote>
<p>Others have lent their support to a political process. In an op-ed, former NATO Secretaries General Javier Solana and Jaap de Hoop Scheffer called Geneva II “the best—and perhaps the only—chance of averting even greater suffering, radicalization and regional implosion.”</p>
<p>The fighting in Syria has drawn in Iranian, Hezbollah, and Al Qaeda-linked fighters; it has led to a massive refugee crisis; and the United States and others have determined that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons against its own people. As a result, many are skeptical that Geneva II will ever be convened, let alone achieve positive results. The responsibility for producing a political solution, however, is not Russia’s alone. In fact, Moscow claims representatives of the regime have agreed to participate in the conference. This may or may not be true, but the claim remains untested. While the Obama administration and other supporters of the opposition are in favor of Geneva II, they have not exactly twisted the arms of opposition forces to participate. They have instead promised increased weapons shipments and agreed that the transitional government will exclude not only Assad but all “central” members of his regime. These might be viewed as incentives to get opposition forces to come to the negotiating table, but they appear to have had the opposite effect, helping to persuade them to hold out in the hopes of getting enough military and diplomatic support to change the balance of power on the ground. Last week, the new president of the opposition Syrian National Coalition, Ahmad Jarba, said that the coalition would not participate in Geneva II unless opposition fighters strengthen their military position.</p>
<h3>Nuclear arms reductions</h3>
<p>The Obama administration moved on to a “Plan B” in the face of limits to Russian cooperation on Syria. But it has yet to do so in the sphere of nuclear arms reductions.</p>
<p>In a June 19 speech in Berlin, President Obama announced new presidential guidance on U.S. nuclear employment strategy, saying “we can ensure the security of the United States and our allies and partners and maintain a strong and credible strategic deterrent” while reducing deployed strategic nuclear weapons by up to one-third from New START Treaty levels.</p>
<p>A Department of Defense, or DOD, report to Congress on the strategy, however, repeats the finding of the DOD’s 2010 Nuclear Posture Review that “large disparities in nuclear capabilities … may not be conducive to maintaining a stable, long-term strategic relationship, especially as nuclear forces are significantly reduced.” Cooperating with Russia on nuclear arms reductions accordingly remains a priority in the new strategy. The president announced in Berlin the administration’s intent “to seek negotiated cuts with Russia,” as well as to “work with our NATO allies to seek bold reductions in U.S. and Russian tactical weapons in Europe.”</p>
<p>There is just one problem: The Russian government is not interested in pursuing another round of nuclear arms control talks at this time. They have linked further arms reductions to, among other things, U.S.-Russian agreement on missile defense. The Obama administration has worked to persuade the Russians of the long-term technical limitations of missile defense, offered to reinforce these with a political commitment not to target Russian missiles, and proposed a slew of new transparency measures. Russian authorities have rejected all of this, insisting that new talks would require, at a minimum, a new anti-ballistic missile treaty that imposes limits on missile defenses—a nonstarter in Washington.</p>
<p>It is becoming increasingly difficult to make the case that this is merely an opening gambit in negotiations. In recent remarks to domestic audiences, President Putin and other officials have acknowledged Russia’s inability to prevent the United States and NATO from moving forward with missile defense. This has not led them to embrace arms control, however. They have instead emphasized the importance of developing missile defense countermeasures and sustaining and modernizing Russia’s nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>The Obama administration still hopes to persuade Russia to agree to a new round of arms reductions. If it cannot, it will have to consider the alternative of unilateral reductions. Whether or not Russia reciprocates should be irrelevant. The new presidential guidance does not state that the United States can safely reduce the number of its deployed nuclear weapons only if Russia does so as well—although it acknowledges that “large disparities in … capabilities” may be problematic. In any case, if the United States were to unilaterally draw down its arsenal, financially strapped Russia might very well follow suit.</p>
<p>But contemplating a unilateral reduction makes clear that the limits to Russian cooperation in this sphere are not the main challenge. The administration does not need congressional approval to unilaterally reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal. It would, however, still have to deal with the potential political fallout of slashing the arsenal at a time when Iran and North Korea show no sign of slowing down efforts to become nuclear-weapon states, when the scope of China’s nuclear ambitions remains unclear, and when the specter of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of extremist governments in South and Central Asia still provokes great concern. Twenty-four Republican senators have already sent a letter to Secretary Kerry expressing firm opposition to unilateral reductions.</p>
<p>Even if Russia were to agree to a new round of arms talks, such political opposition would remain. The fate of a new—or amended—treaty would be even less certain than that of the New START treaty, which the Senate only ratified after a bruising fight. And if the administration sought to avoid a ratification battle by pursuing reductions with the Russians outside of a treaty framework, those opposed to further arms reductions would still view the process as illegitimate.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In the Snowden affair, as on other issues such as Syria and nuclear arms reductions, greater Russian cooperation could help the United States achieve some of its national and international security objectives. At the same time, limits to the willingness of Russian authorities to cooperate with the United States are not an overriding obstacle to achieving these objectives.</p>
<p>Achieving a political transition in Syria requires a coordinated strategy that can successfully bring opposition forces to the negotiating table, regardless of whether or not Russia commits itself in advance to a full transition away from the Assad regime. Achieving further nuclear arms reductions requires convincing domestic skeptics that further cuts are the right way forward, whether or not Russia is on board.</p>
<p>Limits to Russian security cooperation with the United States should therefore not be cause for consternation. The United States should continue to work with Russia where possible and not treat Moscow’s refusal to cooperate across the board as an indication of a nonfunctional relationship. As importantly, the United States also need not unduly prioritize efforts to overcome the limits of Russian cooperation at the expense of other aspects of U.S. policy toward Russia. In the end, a real U.S.-Russian partnership depends not only on the success of our security cooperation but also our cultivation of civil society and business relations, as well as on the freedoms and quality of governance needed to sustain them.</p>

The plant provides power to buildings in the Capitol Complex.</p><p>Detailing his climate action initiative during a <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/news/obama-old-north-2013.html">speech</a> at Georgetown University on June 25, President Barack Obama put forth a series of steps that his administration will take to reduce carbon emissions, increase climate resilience, and provide climate leadership at the international level. Two of the steps mentioned in his speech—increased energy efficiency and renewable-energy generation at the federal level—while not receiving as much media attention as the Keystone XL pipeline and efforts to reduce carbon pollution from power plants, deserve a closer look. Given the size of the federal government and the fact that it is the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change">largest</a> energy consumer in the United States, the energy savings and emissions reductions resulting from federal leadership in clean energy and energy efficiency could be considerable.</p>
<p>In 2010 the government leased or owned <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/news/energy/2010/12/101223-government-stimulus-energy-green-buildings/">500,000</a> buildings that contributed to the federal government’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/30/science/earth/30efficient.html?_r=0">1.5 percent</a> share of the nation’s annual energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions. To power the more than 3 billion square feet of federal office space, the government spends a staggering <a href="http://www.wbdg.org/references/fhpsb.php">$7 billion</a> per year. Recognizing the opportunities for energy and cost savings, President Obama laid out clean energy and energy-efficiency initiatives for federal buildings in his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/image/president27sclimateactionplan.pdf">Climate Action Plan</a>.</p>
<p>President Obama’s plan raises the federal government’s renewable-energy goal from 7.5 percent to 20 percent by 2020, meaning that 20 percent of the electricity consumed by federal agencies must come from renewable sources either through on-site generation, renewable power purchases, or renewable-energy certificates, or RECs. The original renewable-energy goal for federal agencies was mandated through the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ58/pdf/PLAW-109publ58.pdf">Energy Policy Act of 2005</a>, which was signed into law by former President George W. Bush, and set renewable-energy requirements of 3 percent for fiscal years 2007 to 2009, 5 percent for FY 2010 to 2012, and 7.5 percent for FY 2013 and thereafter.</p>
<p>On energy efficiency, President Obama’s plan does not name a new energy intensity—or energy use per square foot—goal but it does look to strengthen ongoing efficiency efforts through standardizing federal building codes, increasing the ability to manage energy consumption within federal facilities, and partnering with the private sector to create standardized contracts for energy-efficiency investments. Existing efforts were established under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, or <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-110publ140/html/PLAW-110publ140.htm">EISA 2007</a>—also signed by President Bush. EISA 2007 set comprehensive energy-management requirements, including energy-intensity reduction goals for federal buildings, facility energy-tracking standards, new building performance requirements, standards for energy-savings performance contracts, federal agency annual reporting guidelines, and energy-efficient product procurement requirements.</p>
<p>The energy-intensity reduction goal is especially noteworthy because it requires federal agencies to reduce energy consumption per square foot by 30 percent by 2015, compared to 2003 energy-intensity levels. As they have over the past few decades, federal energy-intensity goals reduce energy use and waste in buildings and result in significant cost savings. In a <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=85687">weekly address</a> in 2009, President Obama stated that making 75 percent of federal buildings more energy efficient would save taxpayers $2 billion per year.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the federal government’s energy-intensity and renewable-energy goals are within reach. In her June 27 <a href="http://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/HHRG-113-SY21-WState-KHogan-20130627.pdf">testimony</a> before the House Subcommittees on Oversight and Energy, Department of Energy Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency Kathleen Hogan stated that the federal government had met 7.1 percent of its electricity needs with renewable-energy sources, exceeding its goal of 5 percent for 2012. Compared to 2003, the federal government had achieved more than a 20 percent reduction in energy use per square foot in 2012. These efforts have led to a <a href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/pdfs/climate_action_plan_eere_062813.pdf">15 percent</a> reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions and demonstrate the importance of energy policies that drive continued efficiency upgrades and clean energy deployment.</p>
<p>Aside from overarching federal energy targets, there are two initiatives that can significantly impact energy efficiency and renewable-energy efforts at the federal level: agency-level energy goals and energy-savings performance contracts. These initiatives have already contributed to the federal government’s overall renewable-energy and energy-efficiency strategy, but there is a need for continued efforts on both fronts.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense has become a leader in setting aggressive energy policies that prioritize clean energy consumption at the agency level and could influence other departments to set their own targets. As the federal government’s <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/54209.pdf">largest</a> energy consumer, the Defense Department accounts for about <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/2008_epact_sec203_report.pdf">half</a> of all federal electricity consumption and therefore has the potential to meet half of the federal energy-intensity and renewable-energy requirements by 2020. In 2009 the department updated its energy-performance goals to include a requirement that it produce or procure 25 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025, but it will have to step up its efforts to achieve that and other energy goals in the ascribed timetable.</p>
<p>According to the Defense Department’s June 2013 Annual Energy Management <a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/energy/energymgmt_report/FY%202012%20AEMR.pdf">report</a>, it failed to meet federal renewable-energy or energy-intensity goals during FY 2012. Despite an energy-intensity target of 21 percent, the Defense Department only reduced facility energy intensity by 17.7 percent in 2012, and only 4 percent of the department’s electricity use came from renewable sources, compared to a target of 5 percent. When total renewable-energy production is considered rather than consumption alone, 9.6 percent of the Defense Department’s electricity came from renewable sources, which counts toward its 25 percent by 2025 goal.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the department’s renewed commitment to increase renewable-energy generation capacity on Army, Navy, and Air Force installations from the current 132 megawatts to <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/army-navy-and-air-force-on-track-for-3-gw-of-solar-by-2025">3 gigawatts</a> by 2025 will move the department closer to its renewable-energy goal. In addition, this new commitment could create a “green” standard for renewable-energy deployment among federal agencies and encourage those that are lagging behind to expand their efforts.</p>
<p>Another factor that could spur greater energy-efficiency and renewable-energy use is the energy-savings performance contract, or ESPC. Energy-savings performance contracts are public-private partnerships that allow the federal government to make energy-efficiency upgrades or install renewable-energy technologies to federal buildings at a net-zero cost since project financing is repaid through energy cost savings over the life of the project. Existing in one form or another since the Carter administration, energy-savings contracts have been an effective bipartisan tool to reduce energy use and create jobs, especially during tough economic times. To date, ESPCs have provided cumulative energy cost savings of <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/financing/espcs_awardedcontracts.html">$7.2 billion</a> and stimulated more than $2.72 billion in energy-efficiency and renewable-energy investments.</p>
<p>The Bush administration championed energy-savings performance contracts through legislation, such as the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which permanently reauthorized and facilitated their use, and President Obama has continued to build upon those efforts. In 2011 the White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/12/02/presidential-memorandum-implementation-energy-savings-projects-and-perfo">challenged</a> federal agencies to enter into $2 billion in energy-savings performance contracts by the end of 2013. As of June 2013 federal agencies went beyond the stated goal and identified <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/legislative/hearings/2013%20hearings/6-27-2013%20HOGAN.pdf">$2.3 billion</a> worth of projects, highlighting the desire within the government for ESPCs and energy upgrades.</p>
<p>Despite that desire, ESPCs are underutilized partly due to lack of education and awareness among federal agencies, President Obama’s $2 billion challenge, however, raised the profile of ESPCs and gave federal agencies an achievable goal to work toward. The president should continue to promote the use of ESPCs by issuing a new and even more ambitious challenge.</p>
<p>The new federal renewable-energy and energy-efficiency initiatives set forth in President Obama’s Climate Action Plan build upon previous goals and demonstrate a commitment to federal leadership. Energy goals at the agency level, such as those at the Department of Defense, can ensure that the federal government continues to move toward its energy-intensity and renewable-energy targets. Further, the continued use of energy-savings performance contracts will be key to driving greater reductions in energy intensity and scaling up renewable-energy use.</p>

<p>Since 2004 Congress has imposed restrictions on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, in its annual budget that make it especially difficult for the agency to police lost and stolen guns. One such restriction, known as the lost and stolen gun rider, prevents the ATF from requiring gun dealers to conduct an annual inventory, a process that would allow dealers to promptly identify and report missing guns.</p>
<p>Every year tens of thousands of guns are discovered to be missing from the inventories of federally licensed gun dealers based on inspections of just 20 percent of those dealers. These missing guns—whether they are stolen, illegally sold, or misplaced due to negligent record keeping—pose serious threats to public safety. Guns stolen from dealers often end up in criminal hands.</p>
<p>On the press call, <strong>Mark Jones</strong>, former supervisory special agent with the ATF, will join CAP’s <strong>Arkadi Gerney</strong> to discuss the epidemic of lost and stolen guns in America and detail the prospects of Congress acting this year to remove the rider.</p>

For the past few months building up to Saturday’s not-guilty verdict in Sanford, Florida, nearly everyone with Internet access, a Facebook page, or a Twitter handle was self-deputized as a soothsayer, pundit, or reporter on the case. I had nothing to contribute to that cacophony of conversation.</p>
<p>Now that the verdict is revealed, I share in this great moment of collective grieving among folks who feel justice hasn’t been served. Passions are high, leading <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/07/15/2299051/16-moving-images-from-trayvon-martin-rallies-across-the-country/">many Americans to take to the streets in peaceful protests</a>. Even these nonviolent protests have been challenged by <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/07/15/2301991/playing-into-racist-sterotypes-pundits-baselessly-predict-riots-in-wake-of-zimmerman-verdict/">fear-mongering, right-wing correspondents, who have openly fretted about the public displays of grief leading to rioting or other anti-social outbursts</a>.</p>
<p>Enough already! Let’s shift a measure of our focus off of a singular tragedy involving a young black man to celebrate the repeated triumphs of many black men.</p>
<p>Several hours before the Zimmerman trial jury rendered its Saturday night verdict, I attended an afternoon barbecue to honor the current class and alumni of the Washington-based <a href="http://theinstitute.net/">Institute for Responsible Citizenship</a>, a program that for more than a decade has helped pave a path toward a promising future for some 150 outstanding young black men. The institute is the brainchild of William A. Keyes, who founded the program in the summer of 2003.</p>
<p><em>Full disclosure: Keyes and I are close friends and were even before he started the institute. I was a founding board member of his program, and he serves on the Advisory Panel of the </em><a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/projects/leadership-institute/view/"><em>Center for American Progress’s Leadership Institute</em></a><em>, which I founded two years ago to help people of color advance in the public policy arena.</em></p>
<p>Alarmed by <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2007/10/young_black_males_headed_for_e_1.html">the mythology of news reports that proclaimed black men an endangered species</a>, Keyes felt the sensational accounts of black men in trouble or ensnared in the criminal justice system overshadowed the achievements of a far greater number who were living stable and upstanding lives. As he views the situation, the bad actors grabbed the headlines, and the solid citizens toiled in anonymity. There was an imbalance of perceptions that contributed to the idea that young black men were bad news. Keyes wanted to change that, one black male college student at a time.</p>
<p>“I created the Institute 11 years ago with the express purpose of recognizing African American male college students for working hard and achieving academic success,” Keyes told me recently. “Many of the young men tell me that their participation in the institute marked the first time they were ever affirmed for pursuing academic excellence or affirmed for pursuing careers that will enable them to be a service to others.”</p>
<p>The institute selects outstanding students, who make a two-summer commitment to participate in a series of classes and activities in Washington following their sophomore and junior years in college. While in the nation’s capital, they work full time at internships that are coordinated with their career goals. (Several of the institute fellows have been interns at American Progress and one is a current employee.) Concurrently, they take a rigorous set of academic courses at American University and participate in private briefings with leaders in government, business, and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>This program soars and takes the young men along for the dizzying ride. Among those who have participated, some have gone on to win prestigious Rhodes, Fulbright, and Truman scholarships. An uncounted number are Phi Beta Kappa on their campuses. They are student body presidents, award-winning researchers, entrepreneurs, and nationally acclaimed entertainers. One is a 10-time All-American track and field athlete. Students who have passed through the program currently work as preachers, teachers, professors, doctors, lawyers, artists, musicians, and business owners. Others are preparing to become physicists and neuroscientists, and, as I mentioned earlier, one is a budding public policy expert at American Progress.</p>
<p>Keyes describes himself as “a big-time sports fan,” who at an earlier point in his life felt his career path might lead him to coaching football at a major university. He speaks about the men in his program with the passionate zeal of the coach he never became and, in turn, his acolytes respond to his guidance the same way fullbacks crash through the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p>According to Keyes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been exceedingly frustrated that our society will reward black boys for playing sports and completely ignore young black men who achieve extraordinary academic success. The institute is the place where our young men are encouraged to pursue success. They earn Rhodes or Fulbright scholarships, earn Phi Beta Kappa, get admitted to the top graduate or professional programs, or start careers that will allow them to be of service in their communities. And this is the place where they can feel good about even pursuing such lofty goals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps all said and done, it’s best he didn’t become a high-profile coach, because he might not have achieved an equal measure of success. In the time that the institute has turned out stellar black male scholars, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1608406-10-biggest-college-football-scandals-of-the-bcs-era">many once-pristine college athletic programs have been caught in the glare of embarrassing scandals.</a> At the same time, not a single participant in the institute’s decade-long history has seen the wrong side of the law. “None of them have shot anyone, been arrested for pot possession, or accused of assaulting another person,” Keyes said. “Not a one of them has been arrested for anything in all the time I’ve known each one of them.”</p>
<p>That’s not as shocking a statement as it might appear. Racist vigilantes don’t shoot most black kids on rainy nights. And while far too many young black men are caught up in the criminal justice system, truth be told, <a href="http://billmoyers.com/2012/05/30/infographic-u-s-incarceration-rates/">the overwhelming majority of black men and boys are not in trouble with the law, cops, or their parents</a>.</p>
<p>To be specific, <a href="http://billmoyers.com/2012/05/30/infographic-u-s-incarceration-rates/">a recent study</a> by the American Civil Liberties Union makes much of the disparity in incarceration rates between white, black, and Latino males, noting that 1 in 106 white men ages 18 or older is incarcerated. For Latinos and blacks, the numbers jump to 1 in 36 and 1 in 15, respectively. To say the least, such differences are disturbing and a cause for national concern.</p>
<p>But a more positive spin on those same figures shows that 14 in 15 black men aren’t in trouble at all. This imbalance of attention and focus on the negative drives Keyes bonkers. “Problems get lots of attention, but success is seldom celebrated,” he said. “It’s a simple fact of life that society gets more of what it recognizes and rewards, and gets less of what it ignores.”</p>
<p>At this moment, when public attention appears focused on the plight of black boys and men in America and primed to imagine the most horrible stereotypes are accurate depictions of everyday life, it’s wise to remind everyone not to believe the hype. All hope isn’t lost. Though it might be easy and tempting to believe otherwise, given the preponderance of blather that fills the empty spaces of mainstream and social media, the future for black boys and men is brighter now than it has ever been in our nation’s history.</p>
<p>Similar to many Americans—probably the overwhelming majority of black Americans—I’m appalled by the Zimmerman trial outcome, what it says about our criminal justice system’s view of the value of black life, and how a jury of six white women couldn’t bring themselves to see past race to reach what I consider an obvious, reasonable, and fair decision.</p>
<p>But I refuse to embrace a dire forecast for black boys and men based on this verdict’s outcome. The Trayvon Martin story isn’t the singular template for what lies ahead for black boys and men. Yes, what happened to Trayvon is sad and tragic, but it’s far from an inescapable fate for most, or even all, black boys and men in America.</p>
<p>I witnessed a more probable and promising outcome in the confident faces of the men I saw at the barbecue last weekend. The shame of it is that all the good those men have done and will accomplish is too easily tarnished by the notoriety that befalls the entire group, if only one of them commits a random anti-social act.</p>
<p>If you ask me, the refusal to recognize and reward black male achievements such as those by the institute scholars deserves as much—maybe even more—of our collective outrage than the outcome of Zimmerman verdict.</p>

<blockquote><p>The pending compromise on Senate rules reform is good news for workers, consumers, and anyone who cares about clean air and water. Today’s victory will prevent a minority in the Senate from using the filibuster as a means of nullifying democratically created government agencies and functions that they object to purely for ideological reasons. Until today, a minority in the Senate could make the National Labor Relations Board cease to function or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau essentially weakened, and protecting workers or consumers would be at risk. This compromise will help return the Senate to its proper role as spelled out in the Constitution: advise and consent, not obstruct and delay. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) deserves much praise for his efforts to fix what has clearly been a broken Senate.</p>
<p>We hope this new spirit of cooperation from Senate Republicans also extends to other areas. The president deserves up-or-down votes on his judicial nominations, which have also faced unprecedented levels of obstruction and delay from some Senate Republicans. In particular, we look forward to timely votes on the president’s three nominations to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p></blockquote>

<p>Professional development in education has gotten a bad reputation, and for good reason. Everyone on all sides of the education reform and improvement debate agrees that what most teachers receive as professional opportunities to learn are thin, sporadic, and of little use when it comes to improving teaching. According to Harvard University Professor Heather C. Hill, the “professional development ‘system’ for teachers is, by all accounts, broken.”</p>
<p>One likely reason for this view held by Professor Hill and others is the reliance on short-term, episodic, and disconnected professional learning for teachers—the kinds of training programs that are unlikely to positively influence teaching and improve student achievement. It takes sustained investment of time into teacher training to change instruction and improve classroom outcomes. A review of research on the effect of professional development on increased student learning found that programs had to include more than 14 hours of professional development for student learning to be affected. None of this is lost on the educators on the receiving end of professional development. “Perhaps the most damning indictment of PD [professional development] is that even teachers themselves regard it with contempt,” writes Frederick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute.</p>
<p>Yet the education industry—including federal, state, and local education policymakers, plus all those who work to deliver teaching and learning to students—has recently made a sizable bet on the power of professional support to change teaching and boost student learning.</p>

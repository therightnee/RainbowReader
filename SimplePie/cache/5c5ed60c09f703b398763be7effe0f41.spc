<p>Since 2004 Congress has imposed restrictions on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, in its annual budget that make it especially difficult for the agency to police lost and stolen guns. One such restriction, known as the lost and stolen gun rider, prevents the ATF from requiring gun dealers to conduct an annual inventory, a process that would allow dealers to promptly identify and report missing guns.</p>
<p>Every year tens of thousands of guns are discovered to be missing from the inventories of federally licensed gun dealers based on inspections of just 20 percent of those dealers. These missing guns—whether they are stolen, illegally sold, or misplaced due to negligent record keeping—pose serious threats to public safety. Guns stolen from dealers often end up in criminal hands.</p>
<p>On the press call, <strong>Mark Jones</strong>, former supervisory special agent with the ATF, will join CAP’s <strong>Arkadi Gerney</strong> to discuss the epidemic of lost and stolen guns in America and detail the prospects of Congress acting this year to remove the rider.</p>

For the past few months building up to Saturday’s not-guilty verdict in Sanford, Florida, nearly everyone with Internet access, a Facebook page, or a Twitter handle was self-deputized as a soothsayer, pundit, or reporter on the case. I had nothing to contribute to that cacophony of conversation.</p>
<p>Now that the verdict is revealed, I share in this great moment of collective grieving among folks who feel justice hasn’t been served. Passions are high, leading <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/07/15/2299051/16-moving-images-from-trayvon-martin-rallies-across-the-country/">many Americans to take to the streets in peaceful protests</a>. Even these nonviolent protests have been challenged by <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/07/15/2301991/playing-into-racist-sterotypes-pundits-baselessly-predict-riots-in-wake-of-zimmerman-verdict/">fear-mongering, right-wing correspondents, who have openly fretted about the public displays of grief leading to rioting or other anti-social outbursts</a>.</p>
<p>Enough already! Let’s shift a measure of our focus off of a singular tragedy involving a young black man to celebrate the repeated triumphs of many black men.</p>
<p>Several hours before the Zimmerman trial jury rendered its Saturday night verdict, I attended an afternoon barbecue to honor the current class and alumni of the Washington-based <a href="http://theinstitute.net/">Institute for Responsible Citizenship</a>, a program that for more than a decade has helped pave a path toward a promising future for some 150 outstanding young black men. The institute is the brainchild of William A. Keyes, who founded the program in the summer of 2003.</p>
<p><em>Full disclosure: Keyes and I are close friends and were even before he started the institute. I was a founding board member of his program, and he serves on the Advisory Panel of the </em><a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/projects/leadership-institute/view/"><em>Center for American Progress’s Leadership Institute</em></a><em>, which I founded two years ago to help people of color advance in the public policy arena.</em></p>
<p>Alarmed by <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2007/10/young_black_males_headed_for_e_1.html">the mythology of news reports that proclaimed black men an endangered species</a>, Keyes felt the sensational accounts of black men in trouble or ensnared in the criminal justice system overshadowed the achievements of a far greater number who were living stable and upstanding lives. As he views the situation, the bad actors grabbed the headlines, and the solid citizens toiled in anonymity. There was an imbalance of perceptions that contributed to the idea that young black men were bad news. Keyes wanted to change that, one black male college student at a time.</p>
<p>“I created the Institute 11 years ago with the express purpose of recognizing African American male college students for working hard and achieving academic success,” Keyes told me recently. “Many of the young men tell me that their participation in the institute marked the first time they were ever affirmed for pursuing academic excellence or affirmed for pursuing careers that will enable them to be a service to others.”</p>
<p>The institute selects outstanding students, who make a two-summer commitment to participate in a series of classes and activities in Washington following their sophomore and junior years in college. While in the nation’s capital, they work full time at internships that are coordinated with their career goals. (Several of the institute fellows have been interns at American Progress and one is a current employee.) Concurrently, they take a rigorous set of academic courses at American University and participate in private briefings with leaders in government, business, and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>This program soars and takes the young men along for the dizzying ride. Among those who have participated, some have gone on to win prestigious Rhodes, Fulbright, and Truman scholarships. An uncounted number are Phi Beta Kappa on their campuses. They are student body presidents, award-winning researchers, entrepreneurs, and nationally acclaimed entertainers. One is a 10-time All-American track and field athlete. Students who have passed through the program currently work as preachers, teachers, professors, doctors, lawyers, artists, musicians, and business owners. Others are preparing to become physicists and neuroscientists, and, as I mentioned earlier, one is a budding public policy expert at American Progress.</p>
<p>Keyes describes himself as “a big-time sports fan,” who at an earlier point in his life felt his career path might lead him to coaching football at a major university. He speaks about the men in his program with the passionate zeal of the coach he never became and, in turn, his acolytes respond to his guidance the same way fullbacks crash through the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p>According to Keyes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been exceedingly frustrated that our society will reward black boys for playing sports and completely ignore young black men who achieve extraordinary academic success. The institute is the place where our young men are encouraged to pursue success. They earn Rhodes or Fulbright scholarships, earn Phi Beta Kappa, get admitted to the top graduate or professional programs, or start careers that will allow them to be of service in their communities. And this is the place where they can feel good about even pursuing such lofty goals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps all said and done, it’s best he didn’t become a high-profile coach, because he might not have achieved an equal measure of success. In the time that the institute has turned out stellar black male scholars, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1608406-10-biggest-college-football-scandals-of-the-bcs-era">many once-pristine college athletic programs have been caught in the glare of embarrassing scandals.</a> At the same time, not a single participant in the institute’s decade-long history has seen the wrong side of the law. “None of them have shot anyone, been arrested for pot possession, or accused of assaulting another person,” Keyes said. “Not a one of them has been arrested for anything in all the time I’ve known each one of them.”</p>
<p>That’s not as shocking a statement as it might appear. Racist vigilantes don’t shoot most black kids on rainy nights. And while far too many young black men are caught up in the criminal justice system, truth be told, <a href="http://billmoyers.com/2012/05/30/infographic-u-s-incarceration-rates/">the overwhelming majority of black men and boys are not in trouble with the law, cops, or their parents</a>.</p>
<p>To be specific, <a href="http://billmoyers.com/2012/05/30/infographic-u-s-incarceration-rates/">a recent study</a> by the American Civil Liberties Union makes much of the disparity in incarceration rates between white, black, and Latino males, noting that 1 in 106 white men ages 18 or older is incarcerated. For Latinos and blacks, the numbers jump to 1 in 36 and 1 in 15, respectively. To say the least, such differences are disturbing and a cause for national concern.</p>
<p>But a more positive spin on those same figures shows that 14 in 15 black men aren’t in trouble at all. This imbalance of attention and focus on the negative drives Keyes bonkers. “Problems get lots of attention, but success is seldom celebrated,” he said. “It’s a simple fact of life that society gets more of what it recognizes and rewards, and gets less of what it ignores.”</p>
<p>At this moment, when public attention appears focused on the plight of black boys and men in America and primed to imagine the most horrible stereotypes are accurate depictions of everyday life, it’s wise to remind everyone not to believe the hype. All hope isn’t lost. Though it might be easy and tempting to believe otherwise, given the preponderance of blather that fills the empty spaces of mainstream and social media, the future for black boys and men is brighter now than it has ever been in our nation’s history.</p>
<p>Similar to many Americans—probably the overwhelming majority of black Americans—I’m appalled by the Zimmerman trial outcome, what it says about our criminal justice system’s view of the value of black life, and how a jury of six white women couldn’t bring themselves to see past race to reach what I consider an obvious, reasonable, and fair decision.</p>
<p>But I refuse to embrace a dire forecast for black boys and men based on this verdict’s outcome. The Trayvon Martin story isn’t the singular template for what lies ahead for black boys and men. Yes, what happened to Trayvon is sad and tragic, but it’s far from an inescapable fate for most, or even all, black boys and men in America.</p>
<p>I witnessed a more probable and promising outcome in the confident faces of the men I saw at the barbecue last weekend. The shame of it is that all the good those men have done and will accomplish is too easily tarnished by the notoriety that befalls the entire group, if only one of them commits a random anti-social act.</p>
<p>If you ask me, the refusal to recognize and reward black male achievements such as those by the institute scholars deserves as much—maybe even more—of our collective outrage than the outcome of Zimmerman verdict.</p>

<blockquote><p>The pending compromise on Senate rules reform is good news for workers, consumers, and anyone who cares about clean air and water. Today’s victory will prevent a minority in the Senate from using the filibuster as a means of nullifying democratically created government agencies and functions that they object to purely for ideological reasons. Until today, a minority in the Senate could make the National Labor Relations Board cease to function or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau essentially weakened, and protecting workers or consumers would be at risk. This compromise will help return the Senate to its proper role as spelled out in the Constitution: advise and consent, not obstruct and delay. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) deserves much praise for his efforts to fix what has clearly been a broken Senate.</p>
<p>We hope this new spirit of cooperation from Senate Republicans also extends to other areas. The president deserves up-or-down votes on his judicial nominations, which have also faced unprecedented levels of obstruction and delay from some Senate Republicans. In particular, we look forward to timely votes on the president’s three nominations to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p></blockquote>

<p>Professional development in education has gotten a bad reputation, and for good reason. Everyone on all sides of the education reform and improvement debate agrees that what most teachers receive as professional opportunities to learn are thin, sporadic, and of little use when it comes to improving teaching. According to Harvard University Professor Heather C. Hill, the “professional development ‘system’ for teachers is, by all accounts, broken.”</p>
<p>One likely reason for this view held by Professor Hill and others is the reliance on short-term, episodic, and disconnected professional learning for teachers—the kinds of training programs that are unlikely to positively influence teaching and improve student achievement. It takes sustained investment of time into teacher training to change instruction and improve classroom outcomes. A review of research on the effect of professional development on increased student learning found that programs had to include more than 14 hours of professional development for student learning to be affected. None of this is lost on the educators on the receiving end of professional development. “Perhaps the most damning indictment of PD [professional development] is that even teachers themselves regard it with contempt,” writes Frederick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute.</p>
<p>Yet the education industry—including federal, state, and local education policymakers, plus all those who work to deliver teaching and learning to students—has recently made a sizable bet on the power of professional support to change teaching and boost student learning.</p>

Despite these shortcomings, a <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education/report/2013/07/15/69592/high-quality-professional-development-for-teachers/">new report</a> released today by the Center for American Progress finds that the time is ripe for policymakers and practitioners to develop professional learning for teachers that works, and identifies some examples to help guide them.</p>
<p>The report, “<a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education/report/2013/07/15/69592/high-quality-professional-development-for-teachers/">High-Quality Professional Development for Teachers</a>,” addresses the prevailing disconnect between professional-learning systems for teachers and long-term, sustained improvement in student-learning outcomes, and maps out policies to enhance professional-development programs nationwide. Currently, the report finds that most teachers receive professional-development opportunities that are sporadic, short term, and divorced from teaching and student achievement.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that professional-development activities for teachers spur measurable and lasting improvements to both teaching practices and student achievement, the report recommends professional-learning opportunities meet a core set of standards that, among other things, provide teachers with continuous feedback and opportunities to collaborate and coach. Additionally, the report suggests replacing &#8220;drive-by&#8221; interventions—or single-event interventions—with sustained, regular activities designed to improve teacher instruction.</p>
<p>Another strategy to cultivate instructional improvement is to highlight the connection between teacher evaluations and professional learning. While teacher evaluations can provide important information critical to human-capital resource decisions—such as whether a district decides to promote or dismiss a teacher—teacher evaluations provide essential qualitative information that can help teachers improve their professional practice. As new teacher-evaluation systems are designed, implemented, and reviewed in the states, education policymakers and professionals would benefit from provisions that require teachers and evaluators meet to discuss evaluations and collectively personalize such feedback to foster continual improvement.</p>
<p>In addition to teacher evaluations, the development and adoption of the Common Core State Standards have the potential to be an equally powerful education reformer. Specifically, professional development for teachers must be treated as a valued component to the Common Core State Standards&#8217; success. According to the report, &#8220;If the ultimate intention of the program is to raise the level of learning and achievement among students, then the interim goal must be to improve the quality of instruction,&#8221; which is achieved through sustained investments in professional development for teachers. Without adequate training and continued professional development and support, the teacher&#8217;s ability to improve classroom instruction and student achievement is significantly hindered, thus making the Common Core State Standards an obtuse policy initiative.</p>
<p>Among its recommendations, the report also suggests that reforms to teacher professional-development systems should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a strong evaluation system that identifies strengths and weaknesses in teaching practices</li>
<li>Encourage administrators in schools, districts, and state education agencies to take steps to become experts in changing standards, and make sure teachers are aware of these</li>
<li>Support administrators in schools, districts, and state education agencies in the creation and collection of resources about new standards and assessments</li>
<li>Adapt staffing, the organizations of the school day, and other basic structures of schools to support better teaching</li>
</ul>
<div>While there are many challenges with formulating and implementing high-quality professional-development opportunities for teachers, the work of improving instruction to help students excel deserves attention now—the success of the nation&#8217;s classrooms is dependent on the quality of instruction our students receive.</div>

<p>The United States has a proud history of making sure that everyone benefits from electricity. State regulations paired with federal investments through things such as the Tennessee Valley Authority have made sure that every single American has access to affordable, reliable electricity. As new technologies emerge, we need to maintain this focus on universal access to affordable, reliable, safe, and clean electricity.</p>
<p>“Now&#8217;s the time to focus on avoiding the electrical divide,” said <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/about/staff/caperton-richard-w/bio/">Richard W. Caperton</a>, Managing Director of Energy at the Center for American Progress. “A successful shift to new energy technologies means that all Americans benefit from cleaner, more reliable, and more cost-effective electric service.”</p>
<p>The report offers several possible ways to address the electrical divide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repurposing existing electric service programs</li>
<li>Regulatory changes to the electric industry</li>
<li>Giving companies incentives to address the electrical divide</li>
<li>Creating a federally owned provider of new energy resources</li>
<li>Dialoguing processes to identify solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>While new energy technologies and innovations are to be welcomed for what they can bring in terms of economic opportunity, technological leadership, and the stewardship of our environmental resources, they must be managed with an eye toward inclusion and aim to bridge any potential electrical divide that emerges.</p>

<p>For lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, or LGBT, workers, it is <a href="http://www.lgbtmap.org/file/a-broken-bargain-full-report.pdf">harder to find and keep a good job</a>; this is rooted in discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Since there are no federal workplace protections for LGBT workers, many experience countless hardships and barriers.</p>
<p>In the United States it is assumed if an individual works diligently he or she will be assessed on employment qualifications—not on factors unrelated to job performance. LGBT workers, however, often experience the opposite. As with other workers, LGBT workers deserve a job with a safe and supportive environment where a person’s abilities to succeed will be evaluated rather than a person’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2011/06/02/9716/polls-show-huge-public-support-for-gay-and-transgender-workplace-protections/">9 out of 10 Americans incorrectly believe</a> that LGBT workers are already protected under state and federal law despite Congress first denying LGBT workplace protections in 1974 and continuing to do so now. Momentum seems to be shifting, however, toward workplace protections for LGBT workers; bipartisan support of the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2013/04/24/61294/10-things-to-know-about-the-employment-non-discrimination-act/">Employment Non-Discrimination Act</a>, or ENDA, was evident during markup of the bill on July 10 by the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.</p>
<p>Now, more than ever, this increase in momentum must continue.</p>
<h3>LGBT workers continue to experience a hostile work environment even when they are employed</h3>
<p>The moment an LGBT worker receives an offer of employment, he or she anticipates whether colleagues will be welcoming or not. Yet many encounter anti-gay slurs, jokes, and verbal and/or physical harassment. Moreover, it is not uncommon for LGBT workers to be denied promotions or even risk being fired simply for being LGBT.</p>

<h3>The story of Sam Hall</h3>
<blockquote><p>Sam Hall worked for a mining company in West Virginia for seven years. Although Sam only wanted to provide the best possible life for his family, he ended up spending most days crying on his way to and from work. Management told Sam he had no rights that protected him from verbal and physical harassment. This is Sam’s story about how workplace discrimination changed his life.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Workplace discrimination is a real problem that hurts real people. Congress should take the necessary steps to ensure that LGBT workers have comprehensive protections from discrimination by passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. LGBT workers must have a chance to exhibit their qualifications in order to build a successful life for themselves and their families.</p>

<p>Professional development in education has gotten a bad reputation, and for good reason. Everyone on all sides of the education reform and improvement debate agrees that what most teachers receive as professional opportunities to learn are thin, sporadic, and of little use when it comes to improving teaching. According to Harvard University Professor Heather C. Hill, the “professional development ‘system’ for teachers is, by all accounts, broken.”</p>
<p>One likely reason for this view held by Professor Hill and others is the reliance on short-term, episodic, and disconnected professional learning for teachers—the kinds of training programs that are unlikely to positively influence teaching and improve student achievement. It takes sustained investment of time into teacher training to change instruction and improve classroom outcomes. A review of research on the effect of professional development on increased student learning found that programs had to include more than 14 hours of professional development for student learning to be affected. None of this is lost on the educators on the receiving end of professional development. “Perhaps the most damning indictment of PD [professional development] is that even teachers themselves regard it with contempt,” writes Frederick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute.</p>
<p>Yet the education industry—including federal, state, and local education policymakers, plus all those who work to deliver teaching and learning to students—has recently made a sizable bet on the power of professional support to change teaching and boost student learning. From federally supported and locally enacted educator-evaluation systems to the rollout of the Common Core State Standards, the nascent changes to education all require educators to learn new and better ways to do their jobs. Almost every presentation or speech or conversation about educational reform inevitably includes some reference to the amount of support and training teachers and administrators will need in order to make key reforms real and effective in classrooms.</p>
<p>Just how critical is professional learning for teachers to educational improvement? In many ways professional development is the link between the design and implementation of education reforms and the ultimate success of reform efforts in schools. The evaluation of educator effectiveness based on student test scores and classroom observation, for example, has the potential to drive instructional improvement and promises to reveal important aspects of classroom performance and success. That information may, in some cases, be used as the basis for critical personnel decisions such as whether to dismiss an educator or increase his or her salary. But in order to have the impact on student learning that supporters of reform intend, evaluation needs to be accompanied by insightful feedback about teacher performance that leads to a strategic set of professional-learning activities to help educators improve their practice.</p>
<p>State education leaders in many places know this and have specifically included direction for following up evaluation with professional learning in their public descriptions of educator evaluation. Connecticut lists it as a design principle for its “Education Evaluation and Development” system, stating on its website to “Encourage aligned professional development, coaching, and feedback to support teacher growth.” Colorado lists “professional development” as a necessary support to its educator-effectiveness system, and the District of Columbia includes educator evaluation and professional development and supports on its webpage titled “Ensuring Teacher Success.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 45 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the Common Core State Standards, which set out academic expectations for student achievement that have been called rigorous when compared to most standards currently in place in the states. Now, almost three years after the standards were introduced, and about a year away from implementation in most states, educators and policymakers are thinking not only about the demands these new standards will place on students; they are also grappling with the challenges teachers face as the standards inform classroom instruction. Report after report mentions the need for teacher training and instructional support as an essential part of the success of the Common Core State Standards.</p>
<p>But even if these reforms were not in place, the work of improving teacher training and support would still pose a key element of any improvement plan for education. Effective teaching is an activity that can be learned, and the notion that someone is born to teach is simply inaccurate. Improving the practice of teaching—learning to teach better—does not necessarily come from teaching longer. Experience does not lead directly to better instruction. Enhancing skills, knowing strategies, and understanding content and how to unpack that content in ways that students can understand—these are aspects of teaching that can be learned and improved upon.</p>
<p>Some districts, schools, and teachers are designing, implementing, and experiencing professional-learning opportunities that have the power to improve teaching and enhance student learning. Some states are working on strategies to support teacher learning and that spread the culture of continual improvement to all classrooms. These states aren’t alone in this effort; a number of other organizations are creating different kinds of resources to help improve teaching practice—some in relation to the Common Core State Standards and some in conjunction with educator evaluation. These projects and initiatives are not easy: Teachers may need different supports or activities to improve their practice since what works in one school might not work in another. Moreover, all teaching learning and development activities must be integrated with the day-to-day work of teaching and the standards guiding that work.</p>
<p>Given the need to improve the quality of instruction and the lack of clarity and shared knowledge about what systems and activities improve teaching, this is the right time to take stock of what is known; what kinds of activities are currently underway; and what will be needed going forward as reforms roll through the education system. As is often the case in education, successful systems and strategies emerge in many places around the country but these bright spots too often remain hidden to the majority of educational organizations because of geographic distance and the decentralized structure of schooling.</p>
<p>This paper is the first of a periodic series of reports and briefs by the Center for American Progress looking at professional learning—what states and districts are doing that is working, and what policies are in place to support effective teacher-training activities. The work of improving instruction to help students achieve deserves our attention, particularly now when it is an important part of powerful reforms. This report is an attempt to map the landscape of professional learning to prompt ideas that can grow from the foundation—albeit small—that is already in place around professional learning.</p>

<p>In the United States we have universal access to electricity. It is not only available to Americans who live in densely populated areas, wealthy Americans, or Americans with the technical ingenuity to generate electricity. It is available to 100 percent of Americans and accessible to any who wish to tap into it.</p>
<p>This universal access to electricity arose from a very intentional set of policies put in place throughout the 20th century, mostly requiring utilities to provide service to everyone in their service territory and then using government support for the development of new electricity infrastructure to ensure that every home could be part of that utility’s service territory. This was a moral and legal contract that electric companies entered into with the American people, and it generated a great amount of business for them as it fueled the rapid growth of our nation’s middle class.</p>

<p>In the United States we have universal access to electricity. It is not only available to Americans who live in densely populated areas, wealthy Americans, or Americans with the technical ingenuity to generate electricity. It is available to 100 percent of Americans and accessible to any who wish to tap into it.</p>
<p>This universal access to electricity arose from a very intentional set of policies put in place throughout the 20th century, mostly requiring utilities to provide service to everyone in their service territory and then using government support for the development of new electricity infrastructure to ensure that every home could be part of that utility’s service territory. This was a moral and legal contract that electric companies entered into with the American people, and it generated a great amount of business for them as it fueled the rapid growth of our nation’s middle class.</p>
<p>The same conditions exist in traditional telephones. Every American has access to a landline, whether or not they use it. But with significant technological changes in telephones and information technology—such as the rapid growth of wireless and data services—our commitment to providing universal access to high-quality communications services such as broadband Internet or cell-phone service to every American is running into challenges, resulting in what is known as the “digital divide.” The emergence of an information economy and the rapid transition in both physical infrastructure and corporate business models were powerful engines of growth and prosperity for our nation, and they were a welcome boost to the U.S. economy. But it was also disruptive, and while the situation is improving, the polarizing divide has not been entirely averted.</p>
<p>The electricity industry is now entering a similar period of rapid change as that faced by the telecom industry a decade ago. New technologies from smart grids and solar panels to superefficient homes and electricity storage are all coming on-line rapidly at the same time that our legacy infrastructure faces the unanswered challenges of an aging fleet of power plants and transmission lines. This is coupled with destabilizing pollution threats and the disruptive force of rapidly changing fuel costs due to the collapse of natural gas prices.</p>
<p>If these deeply transformative changes in the U.S. power sector are not managed properly, 21st century America could see an emerging electrical divide not unlike the digital divide of the late 20th century. Again, these changes and innovations are to be welcomed for what they can bring in terms of economic opportunity, technological leadership, and the stewardship of our environmental resources. But they must be managed with an eye toward inclusion and aim to bridge any potential electrical divide that emerges.</p>
<p>In this issue brief we explain how this electrical divide could come to pass and how it can still be avoided, drawing on lessons learned from America’s earliest history with electrification, as well as from the recent growth of the telecom industry and the emergent challenges of the digital divide.</p>
<h3>Electrification in the United States</h3>
<blockquote><p>Electricity is no longer a luxury. It is a definite necessity. It lights our homes, our places of work and our streets. It turns the wheels of most of our transportation and our factories. In our homes it serves not only for light, but it can become the willing servant of the family in countless ways. It can relieve the drudgery of the housewife and lift the great burden off the shoulders of the hardworking farmer. — President Franklin D. Roosevelt, September 21, 1932</p></blockquote>
<p>It is hard to imagine life in the United States without electricity. It is so ingrained in our everyday lives that it is easy to forget that it was not always available to all Americans. But universal access to electricity actually took half a century to materialize.</p>
<p>In the 1880s many small-scale electric companies began to emerge as they saw an opportunity to offer a safer alternative to gas lighting. Initially focused on providing streetlights and commercial illumination, these companies expanded their service to include industrial customers in the 1890s and eventually added residential customers after the turn of the century. But the transition to residential customers was slow and inequitable, especially for low-income and rural Americans.</p>
<p>Residential electricity service was limited to the wealthy at first, as privately owned utilities could make more of a profit off of customers who could afford to purchase electric appliances that boosted a household’s electricity use. Utilities eventually began to offer service to most urban residents, not just the wealthy. But rural households were literally left in the dark because utilities were not economically motivated to provide electricity service to houses that were far away from their central power stations. Distribution lines were expensive and a particularly unattractive investment since many utilities thought farmers would not be able to afford electric service.</p>
<p>By 1932 more than 80 percent of urban households had access to electricity, while just 11 percent of farms were hooked up to the grid. Recognizing the need to provide electricity to rural areas of the country, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 7037 on May 11, 1935, and then signed the Rural Electrification Act into law in 1936. These actions established the Rural Electrification Administration, which provided low-interest loans and assistance to rural electricity cooperative utilities to help finance the construction of distribution facilities—and in later years generation facilities—that would provide electricity to farms. The government also created the Tennessee Valley Authority and other electric-power providers to generate electricity that would serve rural America. The government also authorized and provided funding for the construction of the Hoover Dam to electrify the Southwest. This combined effort was successful: Rural access to electricity went from 11.6 percent in 1935 to nearly 50 percent in 1945. By 1953 more than 90 percent of farms had the ability to connect to the grid.</p>
<p>Every American now has access to affordable, reliable, and safe electricity. This is an impressive accomplishment that required government action to make it happen.</p>
<h3>Universal electricity access</h3>
<p>Universal access to electricity arose out of a policy commitment, not from free-market business practices. The fact is that a free market dominated by rational profit-maximizing businesses would result in some people not being served. Absent a policy directive to provide universal service, profit-maximizing utilities would only provide service to customers in cases where the revenue from that customer was greater than the additional cost of serving that customer. In economic terms, the utility would serve to a point where marginal revenue equaled marginal cost.</p>
<p>The problem is that some customers may not be profitable to serve, as was the case in the early days of American electrification. Customers in remote areas, who require long copper wires in order to be reached, or low-income customers, who use very little electricity—not having air conditioning or a television can lead to very little usage—would be particularly susceptible to not getting high-quality, reliable, and affordable service.</p>
<p>The solution is to have some amount of cross-subsidization among customers; that is, some customers may pay more for electricity than it costs to serve them, while others may pay less. This is not necessarily economically efficient, but the beneficial outcomes of universal access to electricity more than outweigh the costs. This cross-subsidization is supplemented with government spending through programs such as the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps vulnerable families pay their energy bills.</p>
<p>The benefits of universal access are tremendous, but we sometimes take them for granted in the United States. Countries that have universal access to electricity benefit from social and economic opportunities that are critical to the modern economy. Electricity access offers efficient lighting and cooking options, as well as gateways to income-generating activities, communication tools, educational resources, modern health care services, and increased productivity and competitiveness. Universal access to electricity also ensures a broad customer base for the manufacturers of modern products—from manufactured appliances to modern computing and communications tools—and it has powered the growth of the American middle class. Universal energy access is so fundamental that the United Nations has launched a major global initiative that calls for universal access to modern energy services by 2030. This effort will attempt to address the 1.3 billion people who lack access to electricity worldwide, including nearly 300 million people in India alone.</p>
<p>As the U.S. electricity system evolves in response to technological change, an aging infrastructure, and mounting pressure to reduce the pollution that is causing climate change, it is more important than ever to renew the commitment to this great and uniquely American value and ensure that safe, reliable, and affordable electricity continues to be available to all citizens.</p>
<h3>The utility death spiral</h3>
<p>There are dramatic changes currently afoot on the electric grid, driven by both innovative business models based on new technologies and the imperative to decarbonize electricity generation. With the costs of rooftop solar declining rapidly—solar photovoltaic panel prices have dropped 80 percent since 2008—and with grid-scale energy-storage systems on the verge of greater commercialization, it is conceivable to imagine a future in which people are no longer connected to a utility’s wires or are generating their own power and connecting only to the grid as a convenient backup service or insurance policy. When those people leave the core service area of a utility company, however, the fixed costs of maintaining the grid as a shared infrastructure do not decline because almost all of the grid is still needed to serve other customers.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine that your neighbor disconnected from the grid. If you are still connected to the grid, then the number of wires coming into your neighborhood will not change; the substation located on the edge of your neighborhood will not change; the wires running down your street will not change; and the transformers hanging on the poles will not change. What will change, though, is the number of customers paying for all that infrastructure. Since the grid must be maintained despite the loss of one paying customer, your electric rates will go up slightly.</p>
<p>If this pattern of people leaving the grid becomes a trend, then the loss of this first person could signal the beginning of a so-called utility death spiral. Your power rates will go up slightly, and all of a sudden it makes sense for you or your neighbor to install solar panels, invest in energy efficiency, hook up some batteries, and maybe even fully disconnect from the grid as well. Everyone else’s power rates go up a little more, and more people leave the grid. This can happen slowly at first, but the effect gets more and more serious as more people disconnect.</p>
<p>If unaddressed, such a feedback loop can ultimately result in a highly inequitable circumstance where only those ratepayers unable to afford leaving the system must shoulder the burden of sustaining the public infrastructure that provides insurance to the rest of the economy. This type of death spiral is a serious and mounting threat to the principle of universal access, and it has already been seen within the telecom industry, which we detail below. This experience in information and communications technology should be seen as a cautionary tale from which the utility sector can learn.</p>
<h4>The telecom industry death spiral</h4>
<p>Since 1934 telephone-service providers have been required by the Federal Communications Commission to offer wired telephone service to all U.S. households. Over the past 15 years, these providers have had to adapt to changing technology, as more and more customers have either added wireless service to their landline service or have switched over to wireless entirely. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 35.8 percent of U.S. households were wireless-only subscribers in 2012—a 77 percent increase since 2008. During the same period, the percentage of landline-only customers dropped nearly by half, going from 17.4 percent to 9.4 percent. Currently, 52.5 percent of U.S. households have both wireless and landline service.</p>
<p>The rising number of customers who opt out of landline service leaves a smaller and smaller share of customers left to pay for a system with a massive amount of infrastructure that must be maintained, as well as expanded to every new home whether it will be used or not. This leads to higher service costs for remaining landline users, which in turn leads more customers to choose to cancel or go without landline service to avoid the increasing prices. In California, for example, some customers have seen landline rate hikes of up to 50 percent over the past two years alone, causing those customers to consider a move to wireless-only service.</p>
<p>The utility death spiral is not necessarily a bad thing. Even though traditional landline telephone-service providers have suffered, most Americans now have dramatically better communications services. The same will be true in energy because people will only switch away from current providers if the alternatives are better. The problem arises because the principle of universal service is deeply embedded in the companies that are harmed by the utility death spiral, and universal access is not a core value for the new service providers.</p>
<h4>The digital divide</h4>
<p>The move to other telecom services has not only led to a decline in landline-service users, it has also opened up the digital divide, which is the gap between those individuals who have and those who do not have access to certain services.</p>
<p>Telecom services such as broadband Internet and cell-phone service have recently become almost as essential to everyday life as access to electricity. And, as with electricity, it is important that these services are available to every American. Access to some of these telecom services, however, is not universal.</p>
<p>Some rural areas are still experiencing limited access to the new technologies and services being offered by telecom companies such as broadband and cell-phone service. There are, in fact, rural parts of the country that still rely on dial-up Internet service and are stuck with unreliable cell-phone service. An estimated 19 million Americans live in areas deemed too expensive to serve by high-speed Internet companies, much like the farmers in the early days of electrification. Overall, nearly a third of the country—about 100 million Americans—lack high-speed or broadband Internet access.</p>
<p>Internet accessibility, however, is not just a function of where you live. Income level is a major factor in determining Internet accessibility as well. A 2012 Pew Research Center report found that adults living in households earning less than $30,000 per year are 35 percent less likely to have Internet access than those in households earning $75,000 or more. Pew also found that a third of dial-up Internet users cited price as a barrier to broadband service, while 17 percent said that broadband was not available where they live.</p>
<p>Additionally, a 2010 study of the early deployment of broadband telecommunications technologies showed that minorities were left behind.<strong> </strong>This is a huge drain on those economies and forecloses those citizens’ access to the advantages and opportunities of engaging with an increasingly wired world.<strong></strong></p>
<h4>The electrical divide</h4>
<p>This digital divide offers a learning opportunity for utilities and policymakers as they look to the future of electricity. If everyone has the same ability to embrace new technologies and leave the grid, then there likely would not be any reason for concern. But, as the experience in telecom shows, not everyone will have the same access to high-quality alternatives such as rooftop solar power and energy storage systems either because of a lack of service available or a cost issue.</p>
<p>The advantages of these distributed energy technologies are further amplified when they are networked through access to a robust electricity grid. Even in an energy environment that is increasingly dominated by smart and distributed power generation close to the point of use, the public infrastructure of our electricity grid will be essential to deriving the maximum economic potential from these emerging technologies.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons that many people will not be able to switch away from the grid, no matter how cost-effective it may be. For renters, making expensive investments in solar panels, energy efficiency, and batteries simply would not be an option, and the property owner would be unlikely to make the investments if they are not paying the electricity bills. Some people may live in a house that is geographically ill-suited for renewable energy—if the roof is always covered by shade and nearby buildings block the wind that could turn a micro turbine, for example. People with low credit scores may not be able to get financing to install new technologies and may not have the cash on hand to make the upfront investments.</p>
<p>The combined result of all these factors will be that some people are stuck paying increasingly higher electric rates, while other people—homeowners with good credit scores who live in ideal locations, among many other factors—are able to switch to cheaper alternatives. The people remaining on the grid will still have electrical service, but the service will be increasingly expensive. And as the cost to maintain the grid—which is likely to increase, not decrease, as the grid ages—gets spread among fewer and fewer people, the level of maintenance will almost certainly decline, leading to lower reliability for those customers. In short, we could have an outcome in electricity much the same as in telecom, where an electrical divide arises between those with and without the ability to access new electric services.</p>
<p>To be clear, this scenario is not going to happen next year and is unlikely to happen in the next decade. But given the pace of change in energy technologies happening today, we need to consider the possibility that this could take place much faster than we expect. The possibility of an electrical divide is no reason to stall the deployment of clean, efficient, and distributed energy generation. This would be as absurd as trying to avoid the digital divide by standing in the way of mobile telephones or advanced data and Internet services. Quite the opposite is in fact true: Climate change requires America to rapidly shift to smart and efficient technology powered by clean renewable energy.</p>
<p>Further, it makes no sense to attempt to stand in the way of people disconnecting from the grid or bringing smarter tools to the marketplace when there are better ways to meet customer’s energy needs and power the nation’s economy. Being aware of the potential downside that could accompany this exciting technology disruption requires a clear-eyed analysis backed by the strong intention to widen access to the opportunity that can come with clean, smart, and distributed energy.</p>
<p>The possibility of an electrical divide does mean that we need to make a serious commitment to universal access to high-quality electricity service. As we have seen with the original electrification of America, simply espousing universal access as a goal is insufficient: We need the policies to make universal access a reality as we quicken the emergence of a new distributed and highly efficient networked energy web. The market will fail to provide universal access if left to its own devices.</p>
<h3>The changing electricity sector</h3>
<p>Current and emerging technologies will change the power sector and need to be taken into consideration in future planning in order to preserve universal access and avoid the pitfalls of the telecom industry. Utility companies are aware that higher penetrations of distributed generation will require some new business-model thinking, but they are also counting on a future of innovative technologies that will continue to be grid dependent. The reality is that the possibility for some to disconnect from the grid may not be too far off.</p>
<p>NRG Energy Inc., through its subsidiary NRG Residential Solar, is currently testing residential solar photovoltaic, or PV, systems with battery storage. These systems would function as either off-grid or grid-tied structures and would allow customers to store any excess solar-energy generation in the batteries. President and CEO of NRG Energy David Crane also mentioned an even more groundbreaking distributed energy system that will be offered in the future during the MIT Energy Conference in March: an NRG system that would combine both solar PV and natural gas-fired generation, allowing homeowners to completely disconnect from the grid. Aside from solar panels, this new system would include natural-gas-powered fuel cells and microturbines that would produce electricity whenever the solar panels did not.</p>
<p>New energy systems such as the ones being proposed by NRG will further disrupt the utility business model since utilities will not be able to recover any fixed costs from homeowners who opt to power their homes using an off-grid energy system. It is too early to speculate about the amount of the market share that future grid-independent energy systems will enjoy, but it is certainly not too early to start planning for an electricity future that will include more distributed generation, as well as the option for some customers to disconnect from the grid intermittently as the economics of doing so make sense.</p>
<p>In the next section, we recommend several policies to address the changing electricity sector and how to avoid the electrical divide.</p>
<h3>Solving the electrical divide</h3>
<p>This issue brief is intended to raise awareness of a potential challenge in the future and is a call for policymakers, utilities, and consumers to start thinking about ways to address the problem. We unfortunately do not yet know the perfect policy response. In fact, the ideas we present below make it clear that it is doubtful that a perfect policy response actually exists. For one thing, many of the policy options we identify have obvious downsides, which would have to be weighed against the benefits. Another issue is that electric utility structures vary across the country, so solutions that work in some places may be impossible in others.</p>
<p>With that disclaimer, there are a few policy tools that could help provide universal access to high-quality, clean electricity in a world powered by exciting new technologies.</p>
<h4>Repurposing existing electric service programs</h4>
<p>One option is to redirect existing energy-spending programs toward solving the electrical divide. The federally funded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, for example, could be expanded to include renewable-energy funding for low-income households. In its current form, LIHEAP provides home energy-bill assistance to low-income households. If expanded at the state or federal level to include funding for renewable energy access, LIHEAP could help address unequal access to distributed-generation resources and provide an “electric safety net” for those who may not be able to afford the higher electricity rates that will result from costs concentrated among fewer customers. The Weatherization Assistance Program could be used in much the same way.</p>
<p>In 2010 California demonstrated that this type of solar program is a viable option by setting aside $14.7 million from its LIHEAP to fund the Solar For All California pilot program. In total, the program helped install solar systems for 1,482 low-income households, including both single- and multifamily residences. In order to be successful, the program used a competitive bid process and worked with energy providers to offer a free system to low-income residents, increase home energy efficiency, and create jobs for low-income workers. In addition, more than $3.5 million was leveraged through local and other private partners, which allowed more households to participate in the program.</p>
<p>The Rural Utilities Service, or RUS, is another federal program that provides financing for electric systems across rural America. RUS is in the process of approving a new program that would provide loans to households that want to install distributed generation and energy-efficiency tools. This program could be expanded, and portions of it could specifically be targeted to address any future electrical divide.</p>
<p>Various state programs exist to fund electric service, and these could all be transformed to specifically address the electrical divide. Many states, for instance, collect funds from a “public benefits charge” to pay for special electricity programs such as low-income assistance or innovative technologies.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge for this approach is that there are existing stakeholders for each of these programs who could suffer if their funding were repurposed. The programs are presumably already paying for good things, and using the money for other purposes would mean these good things would no longer be funded. This may be a worthwhile trade-off, but it is a trade-off nonetheless.</p>
<h4>Regulatory changes to the electric industry</h4>
<p>The companies providing the tools that let people disconnect from the grid could be required by law to provide solutions to everybody in an area, not just those who can afford it. In effect, this would treat these new companies the same as the utilities that previously served the same customers. Similar to how today’s utilities are given the right to operate a profitable business in exchange for providing equal service to everyone in an area, tomorrow’s energy companies could be given beneficial treatment while offering equal service to all customers.</p>
<p>This is a very straightforward solution, but it has drawbacks. For one, the new energy companies will own their power-generation assets, but 19 states have declared that utilities are not allowed to own generation facilities as a result of electric-industry restructuring in the 1990s. More problematic, however, is the fact that the new companies would have to be offered some sort of enticement to agree to this solution. It would also look very different in regulated electricity markets and in those markets that allow retail competition. With today’s utilities, that offered enticement was the ability to operate as a monopoly with a guaranteed rate of return. It is hard to imagine policymakers offering that same deal to new energy companies today.</p>
<p>A twist on this policy solution would be to mandate that existing utilities offer the technologies that would allow customers to disconnect from the grid. Duke Energy, for example, is exploring this path.</p>
<h4>Give companies incentives to address the electrical divide</h4>
<p>While the idea of repurposing existing programs is primarily focused on giving solutions to consumers, there may be a blunter tool: giving money to companies to solve the problem. A distributed generation company, for example, could earn a tax credit by putting solar panels on a low-income household. Existing tax incentives for renewable energy have been a tremendous success, proving that these companies are responsive to these tools.</p>
<p>This solution, of course, involves new government spending. This means that policymakers would likely need to find a new source of revenue. The first source policymakers could consider would likely be some sort of fee on electric bills, but this fee would have its own death spiral: As more people leave the grid and avoid paying the fee, the remaining people on the grid would have to pay a larger and larger fee to end up with the same amount of money. Finding a stable, sufficient revenue stream is critical.</p>
<h4>Create a federally owned provider of new energy resources<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></h4>
<p>When the government wanted to electrify rural America, they could not find a private company that would provide the power. So instead of waiting for a business to see the light, it simply created a new company, the Tennessee Valley Authority, or TVA. TVA has been an overwhelming success story at providing affordable, reliable power to rural America.</p>
<p>The government could do the same thing with new energy technologies. If there are places for which or people for whom a for-profit company would not provide distributed generation, energy storage, energy efficiency, and smart appliances, the government could step in as the provider. There are certainly people who would argue that this is not an appropriate role for government, but the history of government assistance and the TVA show that this model can be a success.</p>
<h4>Dialogue processes to identify solutions</h4>
<p>Another option is to admit that we do not know the perfect solution and to proactively move forward through official dialogues. One way to do this would be to have utilities, consumer advocates, and regulators meet to discuss the challenges that they will face as a result of the increased use of distributed energy resources. This planning exercise could involve the analysis of several scenarios to examine the revenue and load impacts of differing penetration levels of distributed generation. Through the analysis, utilities and regulators would be able to determine the appropriate fixed cost allocation at each level and the optimal amount of distributed resources in terms of operational efficiency and cost recovery. If, for example, the most optimal penetration level for distributed generation is determined to be 40 percent, then utilities could align their incentives and policies with that goal in mind. Incentives that encourage investment in distributed generation, such as net metering, could then be used until the optimal level is met.</p>
<p>Another possibility would be to set up a task force potentially housed at the National Academy of Sciences that would set best practices and make recommendations on how to ensure affordable and universal access to electricity going forward. This task force should include ratepayer advocates, utility representatives, senior city officials, and utility regulators. The panel could be tasked with investigating the impacts of increased use of distributed generation—including the possibility of off-grid generation—within a utility service area on both ratepayers and utilities. The task force could then determine ways to mitigate any short- and long-term impacts and present a road map to continued universal electricity service.</p>
<p>These solutions are the easiest next steps but also the least satisfactory. Simply put, they are not “solutions” at all so much as they are steps that hopefully would result in identifying solutions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The current electricity system in the United States is one that is available to all Americans, but it is overly centralized and polluting. As the system inevitably evolves to include more clean distributed generation and more information technology to improve efficiency at the point of use, we must maintain our commitment to universal electricity access even as the fundamental design of our energy grid is transformed. If we fail to meet this challenge, our future electricity services will be distributed unevenly—much like new telecommunications services such as broadband Internet and cell-phone service—with a harmful effect on citizens, communities, and the larger economy.</p>
<p>Ensuring universal access to electricity will require real leadership and a commitment to implement a new suite of policies that take into account the needs of low-income and rural Americans. Utilities also need to start planning now for the coming technology changes, pricing structures, and evolving business models that will enable greater adoption of distributed generation without erecting barriers to these market shifts in order to allow the development of a more distributed energy grid with more adaptable relationships to customers who relate to the grid in new and more flexible ways.</p>
<p>In this issue brief we laid out some initial policy approaches to begin to address the impending changes in the electricity sector. While there is no silver bullet, these policies could help utilities, consumers, and regulators tackle the emerging issues that utilities and ratepayers alike will face as more distributed generation comes online, challenging the traditional utility model to adapt. Policymakers must plan for these changes today without allowing America’s historic commitment to universal service to be threatened.</p>

<p>For the past 50 years, national education policy has focused on states as critical drivers of educational improvement. Since Congress enacted the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965, the federal government has emphasized states’ shared responsibility for improving student achievement. But states still struggle with the daunting task of improving many school systems at once—a task exacerbated by the persistence of achievement gaps by race, ethnicity, and income level. Many schools have a long way to go to produce students who will be competitive as young adults in the global economy.</p>
<p>When Congress reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 2001 as the No Child Left Behind Act, it called upon states to provide technical support to schools. Specifically, Congress asked states’ education agencies to organize “school support teams” to work closely with school and district staff on school improvement. Some states have different names for them, but whatever they are called, they all help schools with developing plans for improvement and monitoring progress toward achieving their goals. In theory, the task of support teams is straightforward: Improve the performance of districts and schools. But there is nothing simple about what support teams do. Team members coach district and school leaders in the complex work of improving teaching and learning—leading them through an intensive process of self-assessment, planning, and action.</p>
<p>These support teams, however, are quite far from center court. To put it another way, these coaches are somewhat removed from the action. If what teachers do in classrooms—their speech and gestures, the materials they use, how they plan to use classroom time—matters most to educational improvement, what influence can these teams have over that process when they are far away from the classroom? State support teams typically work with district and school leaders but not directly with teachers. And as we all know, coaches do not win games. Yes, coaches coordinate practices for players, but when it’s game time, it is the players who must execute and play the game. The support teams stay on the sidelines making adjustments, giving advice, and reminding others of their specific duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>This issue brief explores one part of states’ work for school improvement—specifically, how state support teams have improved school performance. This brief also considers what issues school leaders face and how these support teams have attempted to help schools meet these challenges. The brief includes some examples of support teams that have changed the ways district and school leaders do their work, but their impact to date on student achievement has been limited.</p>
<p>Three themes emerged in this look at support teams. We consider them in turn below.</p>
<h4>State support-team effectiveness varies widely<em></em></h4>
<p>State support teams are staffed with experienced educational leaders and specialists, but the structure of these teams and the services and support they provide differ from state to state. Typically, support teams help districts or school leaders develop strategic plans and play a key role in monitoring progress, but teams vary in the other types of assistance they provide. Nevertheless, working in close collaboration with these teams, some local leaders have been able to significantly improve how districts and schools support teaching and learning, and the most effective teams have gone a long way in building the capacity of local school leaders.</p>
<h4>State support teams in their current form may have done little to improve student achievement<em></em></h4>
<p>There is scant research about the effectiveness of state support teams. What research there is indicates that local leaders can learn a lot from support teams, but when it comes to student achievement, their impact has been limited. State support teams typically work with district and school leaders—rather than with teachers—and this distance from the classroom might explain why many teams have not had more impact on student learning.</p>
<h4>State support teams, if they are to become a more effective reform strategy, may require some redesign<em></em></h4>
<p>As part of this brief, we looked abroad and found that education systems can spur and sustain improvement through regional support organizations. Specifically, high-performing education systems can and do provide technical support through structures between central authorities and their schools. In Shanghai, China, for example, district leaders match low-performing schools to high-performing schools in strategic partnerships for school improvement. In the United States, state support teams could leverage their knowledge about local education systems to facilitate similar types of collaborative partnerships.</p>
<p>As currently designed in many states, the support-team strategy has great potential to improve the practice of school leaders. Nevertheless, if policymakers hope to improve student outcomes, states should ensure that teams work with district and school staff to support teachers’ growth. As such, this brief recommends strategies that states can employ to more directly impact teaching and learning.</p>
<h3>What are state support teams, and how have they supported schools?</h3>
<p>Increasingly, states have been providing support to schools and districts through support teams. States have assembled teams of experienced practitioners to work on school improvement. These teams might include former principals or superintendents, and they might also be staffed with specialists in math or English language arts or in analyzing data. Irrespective of their makeup, the purpose of these teams is to help districts and schools become higher-performing organizations.</p>
<p>The state-support-team model is not new. It can be traced back to the early 1990s. One early support-team model is the Distinguished Educators initiative of Kentucky’s School Transformation Assistance and Renewal, or STAR, program. Beginning in the 1990s through the present, Kentucky’s Distinguished Educators have supported the work of school leaders around improvement. The distinguished educators are experienced education practitioners who have demonstrated excellence in teaching or education leadership. They are hired by the state to help school leaders develop improvement plans, locate resources for improvement activities, and recommend professional-development opportunities for teachers.</p>
<p>Today a number of state support teams include distinguished educators, but the teams are configured somewhat differently across the states. In New Jersey, for example, the teams include coaches for principals and teachers, content specialists, and data specialists. In California, District Assistance and Intervention Teams can include one of several types of state-approved support organizations. The Orange County Department of Education, for example, is a state-approved organization, and as such, it can provide support services beyond its geographic jurisdiction. This particular team includes the directors of various departments within the Orange County office.</p>
<p>States provide guidance about what effective schools and districts should look like. In New Jersey, Regional Achievement Center teams work with schools and districts according to eight “turnaround principles,” including “effective instruction” or “enabling the effective use of data.” The Iowa Department of Education has “seven characteristics” of effective schools and districts to inform the work of its Iowa support teams. The list of characteristics includes things such as professional learning, learning environment, and collaborative relationships across school staff and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Very similar to business consultants, state support teams work together with district and school leaders primarily on the design of action plans and then the monitoring of the implementation of these plans. When asked which tasks they spent the most time on, support-team members in four northwest states gave the highest rankings to meetings related to planning, improvement, and/or implementation, according to a study by the Regional Education Laboratory at Education Northwest. Even more specifically, these teams work with principals, teachers, and other leaders on goal setting and establishing metrics to measure progress toward goals. Most team members in these northwest states, for example, spent a great deal of time helping educators design so-called SMART goals—“specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound.”</p>
<p>Typically, support teams follow a common approach to continuous improvement: diagnose issues, identify strengths, make plans, monitor progress, and adjust. Essentially, support teams act as a combination of doctors, accountants, and tutors for local education leaders. Team members work with local education leaders to diagnose the major issues that they face in regard to improving schools, and then they develop plans for improvement. Teams review student-performance data, how districts or schools spend their money, and how local leaders and teachers work and what they know. A plan might include, for example, the goal of improving student reading skills by the third grade. The improvement plan might describe how teachers should teach reading in the early grades and how to give teachers opportunities to learn more about the proposed reading techniques.</p>
<p>The teams often take what is best described as a “triage” approach, where, similar to nurses or doctors in the emergency room, they devote much more attention to districts and schools with the highest perceived needs. Depending on the magnitude of the issues facing a school or district, team members may become more closely involved with helping educators follow through on their improvement plans and assist in making midcourse corrections. While plans might help clarify the work and set priorities, plans do not enact themselves. Actually, changing how educators do their work requires more than just setting goals and determining first steps. Support teams must change educators’ routines, have different types of interactions with principals and teachers, and provide new resources or materials to help educators learn how to do their work differently.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that there are many low-performing schools and districts in every corner of the country. To deal with the scale of their improvement efforts, some states deliver support teams to different regions in the state. This often occurs through regional offices affiliated with the state education agency. There are, for example, 6 regional teams in Massachusetts, 7 regional teams in New Jersey, and 10 regional teams in Iowa.<strong></strong></p>
<h4>What impact have these teams had?</h4>
<p>There is little research about how effective these teams have been, and what studies do exist suggest the following: Effective support teams can change the way district staff members do their work, but their impact on student outcomes is relatively small.</p>
<p>According to an evaluation of the Kentucky support-team program, schools working with these teams improved student performance at a higher rate than the full set of schools across the state. Interestingly, while many teachers reported that the support teams changed their teaching practices, only half of the surveyed teachers reported that their students actually learned more because of their schools’ work with the teams. When educators were asked about how to improve Kentucky’s program, they said that the support teams should “spend more time in the school and in classrooms.”</p>
<p>More recently, in Massachusetts, the District and School Assistance Center teams have worked with low-performing districts and schools. There is a support team in each of the six regional centers. The centers—an entire collection of services and supports for schools—have improved how some district staff members do their work, according to a 2012 evaluation of the program. These results are based on survey responses from a small set of local education leaders from across the state. School and district leaders responded to questions about how the state support teams assisted them and how their districts or schools changed as a result. Seventy percent of these leaders indicated that the District and School Assistance Centers contributed “moderately” or “greatly” to their “capacity to address improvement priorities.” Similar proportions of school leaders—66 percent—reported that the centers contributed to their “capacity to monitor progress toward improvement.”</p>
<p>Leaders, however, reported less support closer to the classroom. While 77 percent agreed that the centers contributed “moderately” or “greatly” to “dialogue about teaching and learning,” only 66 percent of these leaders said that the centers helped them improve “staff collaboration around teaching and learning.” The Massachusetts program was not evaluated for its impact on student learning, and the evaluation did not consider the teams separately from other center services. Nevertheless, 58 percent of these leaders reported that the centers contributed to “the quality of instruction,” which suggests—but does not demonstrate—that these programs may have had some impact on student learning.</p>
<p>California has a somewhat similar support-team system known as District Assistance and Intervention Teams. There are a variety of organizations in California that can provide support services, and the state’s Department of Education must approve each organization as a support team. Many are county offices of education, comprising many districts. California’s support teams, on the whole, had some impact on students’ growth in math learning but none on student learning in English language arts, according to one evaluation of the program. The growth in math scores was too small to have any practical significance, though. The evaluation compared districts with support-team assistance and those without it, adjusting for the lower average performance of the assisted districts before they had support-team assistance.</p>
<p>The study also suggested that educators learned new things from the California support teams. This new learning, however, did not lead to noticeable improvements in student achievement, according to interviews with district leadership teams and their support teams. Nevertheless, given the differences in the types of activities these teams provided, these results likely mask the impact of very effective teams.<strong></strong></p>
<h3>Why have support teams had such limited impact?</h3>
<p>In other education systems around the world, support teams do register an impact of student learning, and<strong> </strong>regional centers and similar teams serve an important role in enabling and sustaining school improvement. “In every system we looked at, the first focus of school reforms was on the schools and the center [National Ministry of Education],” according to a 2010 McKinsey report. “Efforts to strengthen the mediating layer usually came later, as the need for an active intermediary in delivering the system improvements became clearer.”</p>
<p>This so-called mediating layer includes both regional-level and district-level organizations. In many education systems in this McKinsey study, intermediary organizations support schools’ unique needs, but these organizations also communicate the center’s (for example, the National Ministry of Education’s) priorities and preferred improvement strategies. In one example from the Western Cape province of South Africa, the McKinsey report authors described how work in the “mediating layer” brought the education center closer to the school: “As the level of support increased significantly, the relationship changed from one of occasional visits from the province or district to one in which a team was housed ‘on the doorstep of the schools.’”</p>
<p>The problem in both the United States and abroad is that support teams face challenges directly related to the distance of their work from the classroom. There are multiple layers of governing bodies and decision makers between states and teachers. One layer of separation, and perhaps the most significant, is the school district where district staff and local school boards have certain powers related to how they run their schools. Though states have the ultimate authority over education, local control is still a major factor in education oversight and management. As such, districts enjoy a large amount of autonomy, and this provides their staff the leeway to make their own decisions. To make the point: District staff could learn about and fully grasp the elements of effective reading instruction, for instance, but there are a number of layers that separate the district staff’s learning experiences on the one hand and teachers’ work in classrooms on the other. What all these individual players—states, districts, and teachers—do is certainly related, but only loosely so. Teachers, of course, still make a great deal of independent decisions, particularly about how to organize lessons and direct classroom-learning activities.</p>
<p>Michael Lipsky’s concept of “street-level bureaucrats” might shed some light on these limitations. Lipsky, a fellow at the public policy organization Demos, notes that decisions made at higher policy levels need to be enacted on the ground level by practitioners who must interpret policy directives and adapt them to “make policy” in their local context. When support teams recommend strategies for school improvement, it is therefore district staff that have to embrace and live them, which entails acting and communicating in new ways.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is very little evidence that districts themselves contribute to school performance and improvement. One recent Brookings Institution study by Grover J. Whitehurst, Matthew M. Chingos, and Michael R. Gallaher attempted to isolate how much districts contributed to academic achievement in two states—Florida and North Carolina. These three researchers found that the district’s contribution to student achievement is quite small compared to the influence of school leaders, teachers, and the students themselves. District-level interventions, therefore, might not have much impact on student learning.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, state education reform can lead to meaningful changes in teaching if teachers are provided with the opportunities to learn about enhanced teaching techniques. David K. Cohen and Heather C. Hill, both education scholars and researchers, showed that ambitious policy reforms in math curriculum, instruction, and assessment can lead to improved teaching and learning when given the right supports. Specifically, teachers can successfully use teaching strategies if the state provides teachers with opportunities to learn about the new instructional practices required by the reforms. But just communicating new strategies to local educators was not enough. Educators needed to participate in certain learning activities, such as multisession workshops focused on math teaching.</p>
<p>Of course, state support teams might have more influence on teaching and learning than we can know based on existing research. The studies from California and Massachusetts described above did not collect information about teachers’ work in classrooms and how they changed their practices, as Cohen and Hill did using teacher surveys.<strong></strong></p>
<h3>Limited impact, but compared to what?</h3>
<p>As has already been stated, it is clear that state support teams have done little to move the needle on student achievement. That does not mean, however, that support teams should be eliminated entirely. Instead, there is a need to build their capacity and make their efforts more targeted. There is also a need to come to terms with the fact that there are few other on-the-job opportunities for district or school leaders to acquire the types of skills and knowledge necessary to improve teaching and learning. While there are many external organizations and individuals who participate in educational improvement, relatively few provide direct coaching to education leaders. What’s more, the most effective ones—though there is scant evidence to demonstrate this—would likely still have scarce time and resources to provide personalized support simultaneously to many districts.</p>
<p>Some states have offered even more-intensive professional-development experiences for their school leaders, but even these efforts have had little impact on students. Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, for example, have offered their principals multiple-session courses through the National Institute for School Leadership, where leaders engage in classroom-based, online, and homework activities over more than a year to explore various roles, responsibilities, and effective practices of school leaders. The schools of those leaders participating in the course showed greater improvement over four years in both English language arts and mathematics when compared to matched schools whose leaders did not participate in the National Institute for School Leadership program, but this impact was small and was not observed until the fourth year, according to a study of the program.<strong></strong></p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>The support teams described in this brief are intensive interventions in districts and schools that are focused on improving how educators organize and support the work of teachers in schools. There is evidence that these teams serve an important role in the larger system, improving how district and school leaders carry out their duties, but it is less clear that support teams improve teaching and learning directly, which is the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>These support teams vary in quality, but the studies referenced here have not isolated the effects of particular teams. This research, then, might mask the potential impact and effectiveness of some teams. Clearly, more states should conduct evaluations of these teams if we are to be able to gauge their usefulness and value.</p>
<p>If subsequent evaluations continue to show limited impacts on student outcomes, then states should adjust how support teams do their work to ensure that their work benefits both teachers and students. To that end, we offer the following recommendations of ways states might improve the effectiveness of their support teams.<em></em></p>
<h4>Ensure that support teams’ work impacts teachers</h4>
<p>In order to improve teaching and learning, states should provide more support directly to teachers. To do this, states could consider assembling teams of high-performing educators to provide comprehensive coaching to teachers based on Kentucky’s Distinguished Educators program model. Following Kentucky’s lead, teams of exemplary teachers could visit with teachers regularly to observe their teaching, discuss it, make recommendations, and then repeat the cycle.</p>
<h4>Decrease the caseload of support teams and increase their engagement with educators<em></em></h4>
<p>Given the scale of low school performance, the triage approach to improving outcomes certainly seems appropriate. States should take advantage of recent policy changes at the federal level, including new flexibility from certain No Child Left Behind Act requirements, to ensure that teams provide high-quality, sustained support to those districts and schools that need the most assistance. In particular, states should commit to limiting the caseloads of support teams so that the experienced educators on these teams can provide even more personalized and extensive support to districts and schools.</p>
<h4>Encourage support teams to match high- and low-performing schools to work collaboratively on improvement</h4>
<p>In many high-performing nations, organizations situated between the central authority and schools form and sustain networks between schools to ensure that educators have the opportunity to learn from each other. In Shanghai, school-district officials match high-performing schools with low-performing schools sharing similar features. The higher-performing school establishes a contract with the low-performing school to provide tailored services and supports, and the two schools work directly together, typically for at least a period of two years. While there is no research available about the impact of this program on student achievement, the Shanghai program provides an example of a support system targeted closer to schools and classrooms.</p>
<p>Following the Shanghai model, state support teams might consider matching schools with demonstrated excellence with the low-performing schools in their portfolios. The support teams could leverage their local knowledge about their state’s lowest-performing schools to provide close matches with higher-performing schools in the state.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>State support teams are a powerful tool that states can use to better collaborate with educators to achieve ambitious school improvement. These teams provide strategic advice and coaching to schools and districts that have so far struggled with driving improvement. Staffed with experienced educators, these support teams have worked hard to identify specific problems and to develop plans for educators to overcome them. Research suggests that state support teams have improved the work of district and school leaders. But as we look more closely into schools and classrooms, their impact is much less clear. These findings may flow from how this research has been conducted, but irrespective of the methodology, there is definitely room for these teams to improve their influence on teachers and students.</p>
<p>This issue brief proposes that states consider redesigning their support teams with an eye on making sure that teams work as closely to the classroom as possible. Furthermore, as states increase the depth of the work carried out by support teams—enabling team members to better help teachers—policymakers should also consider implementing complementary decreases in these teams’ caseloads. While these redesigned teams may influence fewer schools, the new approach may increase the odds of their success.</p>

<p>Thank you for inviting me to join you for this important discussion and, in particular, to offer perspectives on the paper recently released by Dr. Joseph Gyourko titled “<a href="http://www.aei.org/papers/economics/financial-services/housing-finance/rethinking-the-fha/">Rethinking the FHA</a>.” Given the Federal Housing Administration’s, or FHA’s, long and significant role in the U.S. home mortgage market, its recent financial challenges, and the continuing struggling condition of the housing finance system, reaching consensus on the appropriate role for FHA as part of an overall restructuring of our home loan market is essential.</p>
<p>My general response to the paper can be summarized in five points that I will summarize first and then discuss in more detail. Those five observations are:</p>
<ol>
<li>FHA by many measures has been an exceptional success.</li>
<li>FHA has financial challenges, but the sky is not falling.</li>
<li>FHA’s financial challenges are not due to its “government status” per se.</li>
<li>Improvements in FHA’s management could enhance its financial well-being.</li>
<li>A federally subsidized savings program for moderate-income families is an exceptional idea.</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. FHA by many measures has been an exceptional success</h3>
<p>The first sentence of Gyourko’s paper reads: “The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has failed by any reasonable metric.” This statement is belied by the facts. Founded in 1934 with the goal of keeping credit available during crises, the FHA has—in the 80 years since its founding—<a href="http://www.ccc.unc.edu/documents/Dec2012_FHASustainingAndExpandingMarket.pdf">insured 40 million mortgages</a>. This has given millions of American families an opportunity to build wealth though sustainable and safe mortgage products. And over all of these years, it has never cost taxpayers a single dollar.</p>
<p>Before the Great Depression, <a href="http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=penniur_papers">most mortgages were</a> short‐term—typically only 5 to 10 years—interest‐only loans that had to be repeatedly refinanced. FHA initially popularized the fully amortizing mortgage and over time popularized the 30-year, fixed-rate, low-down-payment product. These products drove the increase in homeownership that was a hallmark of the American Dream and wealth creation for the American public throughout the remainder of the 20th century. Further, FHA has reliably served populations that the mainstream mortgage market underserves, whether these markets are rural areas, regions suffering economic downturns, people of color, or low-wealth borrowers.</p>
<p>FHA’s essential role to the U.S. housing finance market is not only of historic significance. The FHA has and continues to play a key countercyclical role. While private mortgage insurers either went bankrupt or dramatically scaled back their lending during our housing crisis, FHA was, due to its governmental status, able to ramp up its role in the market. FHA <a href="http://www.ccc.unc.edu/documents/Dec2012_FHASustainingAndExpandingMarket.pdf">lent heavily</a> into the markets that suffered the largest decrease in home prices during the bust. In fact, its <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=F12MMIFundRepCong111612.pdf">market share rose</a> from roughly 3 percent to more than 30 percent. For home purchase loans, the FHA’s market share shot as high as nearly 40 percent.</p>
<p>Without FHA’s countercyclical role, the recession would have been even more devastating. <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/housing/report/2012/10/11/40824/the-federal-housing-administration-saved-the-housing-market/">According to the best estimate that we have</a> (from Moody’s Analytics), if FHA had stopped insuring mortgages in October 2010, by the end of 2011 house prices would have fallen an additional 25 percent, new home construction would have fallen 60 percent, and home sales would have fallen another 40 percent. What’s more, we would have lost another 3 million jobs, the unemployment rate would have been 12 percent, and the economy would have contracted another 2 percent.</p>
<p>During the crisis, FHA has also supported home purchases, especially by serving first-time homebuyers and borrowers of color. While Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have devoted much of their activity to refinances—<a href="http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/25167/ConservatorsReport4Q2012FINAL.pdf">72 percent of their originations</a> in 2012 were for refinances—FHA has continued to <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=F12MMIFundRepCong111612.pdf">support home purchase loans</a>—62 percent of FHA originations in 2012 served this purpose. Over three-quarters of FHA endorsements in 2012 supported first-time homebuyers. And FHA insurance supported <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=F12MMIFundRepCong111612.pdf">half of home purchase</a> loans made to African American and Latino households in 2012.</p>
<p>As a result, the paper’s assertion that “FHA has failed by any reasonable metric” is a confusing observation that is at odds with reality.</p>
<p>If FHA cannot serve the market, we will lose not only a crucial countercyclical stabilizer but also a key driver in the availability of mortgage credit. And the market will likely severely underserve the very borrowers who are the future of homeownership in America: lower-wealth and borrowers of color homebuyers.</p>
<h3>2. FHA has financial challenges, but the sky is not falling</h3>
<p>Gyourko’s paper is only <a href="http://www.aei.org/paper/economics/financial-services/housing-finance/is-fha-the-next-housing-bailout/">the</a> <a href="http://www.nightmareatfha.com/">latest</a> <a href="http://www.nightmareatfha.com/how-the-fha-hurts-working-class-families-and-communities/">in</a> <a href="http://www.aei.org/press/economics/financial-services/housing-finance/testimony-on-dangers-posed-by-fharelease/">a</a> <a href="http://www.aei.org/paper/economics/financial-services/housing-finance/unfounded-optimism-the-danger-of-fhas-mispriced-unemployment-risk/">series</a> that has warned that FHA is essentially bankrupt, sputtering on its last leg, and ready to collapse at any moment. FHA has legitimate financial challenges, but they are being managed in a responsible manner, and the agency continues to operate without a single dollar of taxpayer subsidy to support its mortgage insurance fund—the fund that is used to pay claims on essentially all of FHA’s single-family insurance.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=F12MMIFundRepCong111612.pdf">2012 actuarial report</a> indicated that the fund faces a capital shortfall of $16.3 billion, or 1.44 percent. The report showed that <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/huddoc/ar2012_hecm_loans.pdf">17 percent,</a> or $2.8 billion, of this shortfall was due to the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage, or HECM, program—the program through which the FHA insures reverse mortgages. The report also shows that the Fund would have $15 billion more in reserves if the <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/huddoc/ar2012_forward_loans.pdf">seller-funded down-payment-assistance</a> program had never existed. The more recent estimates in the <a href="http://www.housingwire.com/news/2013/04/10/fha-may-need-bailout-after-all">president’s budget</a> indicate that the capital shortfall is $943 million—not an insignificant sum of money but a substantial improvement from the earlier estimate. Moreover, even if the fund needs a draw of $1 billion from the U.S. Treasury, that would be a bargain compared to the negative financial and economic consequences likely to have occurred if FHA hadn’t played its key countercyclical role during the crisis. Moreover, FHA’s shortfall is not a cash-on-hand problem; the agency has <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=F12MMIFundRepCong111612.pdf">$30 billion</a> to continue paying claims, which is enough to cover the next 7 to 10 years. Its most recent books of business are highly profitable, and FHA has taken numerous steps that I’ll detail later that will limit its losses and increase its capital reserves.</p>
<p>The FHA’s losses also pale in comparison to those of the private sector—the very financial institutions that Gyourko implicitly and AEI explicitly suggests should run our future housing finance market. Major Wall Street firms and major mortgage lenders—including Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, CountryWide, Washington Mutual, and others—did not have a projected loss over the next 30 years. They went broke and were shuttered or sold at the cost of billions of dollars of taxpayer bailouts. The FHA was needed to step in to fill the void for these and other bankrupt private firms. What’s more, FHA loans are performing far better than the subprime loans the private sector pioneered. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s data for the <a href="http://www.mortgagebankers.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/84409.htm">first quarter of 2013</a>, subprime fixed-rate loans had a delinquency rate of 20 percent and subprime adjustable-rate mortgages had a delinquency rate of 24 percent, while FHA loans had a delinquency rate of 11 percent. The FHA number would be even lower if it didn’t include loans with seller-finance down-payment assistance, as I’ll detail later.</p>
<p>And there’s reason to think the situation is getting better: The single-family early period delinquency rate, an indicator of the strength of new loans, is <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=MMIQtQ12013FIN05152013.pdf">one-seventh</a> of what it was in the height of the crisis. Home prices have been rising quickly—at their <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324809804578510931769289110.html">fastest pace in seven years</a>, according to the Case-Shiller index. And <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.htm">interest</a> <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/release.html">rates</a> have remained lower than what the actuaries assumed in the 2012 actuarial report.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it’s not yet clear whether the FHA will require a treasury draw; we won’t know for sure until September. It is possible that the numerous policy changes implemented by the Federal Housing Administration will give the fund a positive economic value, as happened the last time the fund had a negative economic value in 1990. Draconian pricing and underwriting changes were also proposed during that period, which proved to be unnecessary.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Gyourko paper and <a href="http://www.nightmareatfha.com/how-the-fha-hurts-working-class-families-and-communities/">similar reports</a> offer a misdiagnosis of the cause of FHA’s financial problems. In their take, the main problem is the fact that the FHA supports low-down-payment lending.</p>
<p>That diagnosis is in error. FHA’s losses come from two programs: seller-financed down-payment-assistance loans and HECM loans. Curiously, Gyourko does not mention these programs in his analysis.</p>
<p>The seller-financed program was a fraud-riddled program that essentially used FHA insurance to finance down payments through artificially high sales prices and loan amounts. These loans accounted for 19 percent of FHA endorsements between 2001 and 2008 but drive huge amounts of FHA’s losses—as of the <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/rmra/oe/rpts/actr/actrmenu">2011 actuarial review</a>, 41 percent. Today they <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=F12MMIFundRepCong111612.pdf">account</a> for 4 percent of the outstanding portfolio but 13 percent of seriously delinquent loans. Without these loans, the <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=F12MMIFundRepCong111612.pdf">net economic value</a> of the forward loans fund would be a positive $1.77 billion. <a href="http://www.ccc.unc.edu/documents/QRM%20Underwriting.3.2012.pdf">Research shows</a> that the lifetime default rate of FHA loans originated between 2000 and 2008 would be almost 5 percent lower without these loans—9.7 percent versus 14.4 percent as of February 2011. These loans are ultimately expected to cost the FHA over $15 billion.</p>
<p>HUD attempted to eliminate these loans many times but was prevented by political opposition in Congress until the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-110publ289/pdf/PLAW-110publ289.pdf">Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008</a> banned them starting in the second fiscal quarter of 2009.</p>
<p>Similarly, FHA is facing <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_23443489/house-gives-fha-flexibility-reverse-mortgages">$5 billion in losses</a> from reverse mortgages insured through its HECM program. Although the HECM program takes up just 7 percent of FHA’s portfolio, it accounts for <a href="http://blog.enterprisecommunity.com/2013/04/keeping-the-fhas-short-term-financial-troubles-in-perspective.html">17 percent of its losses</a>. Without the HECM program, <a href="http://www.housingwire.com/news/2013/06/04/galante-hecm-revision-proposal-may-come-soon-july">the fund would have a positive value</a>, according to the president’s budget. Instead, there is now the projected negative $943 million value.</p>
<p>There are three reasons FHA is facing losses on the HECM program. First, historic home price declines have meant that banks cannot recover the full amount of reverse mortgages when houses are sold, leaving FHA liable for the shortfall. Additionally, borrowers are having problems meeting their tax and insurance obligation, leading to default. This has become a serious problem: As of February 2012, <a href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/a/assets/documents/201206_cfpb_Reverse_Mortgage_Report.pdf">9.4 percent</a> of active HECM loans were in default on insurance and/or taxes.Third, in recent years larger numbers of estate executors <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-113-ba00-wstate-cgalante-20130213.pdf">have chosen</a> to have HUD dispose of properties, driving up costs for the agency.</p>
<p>As I’ll detail, FHA is taking steps that address these problems. The House of Representatives has also recently voted to allow FHA additional authority to prevent losses in the HECM program.</p>
<p>The losses FHA is facing due to seller-financed down-payment assistance and HECM loans exist primarily because of congressional inaction, not any failure on the part of the FHA. These losses demonstrate that FHA’s core business model of low-down-payment lending is not the source of its financial challenges. They also don’t show that government agencies price risk any worse than the private sector.</p>
<p>Because the Gyourko paper assumes—but does not prove—that low down payments are the cause of FHA’s financial problems, its conclusions are at odds with the reality of low-down-payment lending as with the facts of FHA’s financial problems. Many affordable homeownership programs, other than FHA, have demonstrated the viability of low-down-payment lending.</p>
<p>The UNC Center for Community Capital <a href="http://www.ccc.unc.edu/abstracts/091308_Risky.php">has studied</a> a large portfolio of loans originated to low- and moderate-income households. These loans are safe, sustainable mortgages underwritten for the ability-to-repay, and many of them have low down payments. These loans have performed remarkably well through the crisis with delinquency rates only slightly higher than that of prime loans.</p>
<p>We can glean more insight on the wisdom of eliminating the FHA—the major source of low-down-payment lending in America—from other studies. For example, the UNC group <a href="http://www.ccc.unc.edu/documents/QRM%20Underwriting.3.2012.pdf">has also examined</a> the effects implementing a down-payment requirement in mortgage rules that are currently being finalized. If regulators implement a 10 percent down-payment requirement, the default rate for a category of safe mortgages, so-called “Qualified Mortgage” loans, drops from 5.8 percent to 4.7 percent. But this sort of requirement means that 30 percent of the loans originated between 2000 and 2008 would be excluded from the market deemed as safe by these new regulations. With a 10 percent LTV [loan-to-value] requirement, nine borrowers are excluded from this market for every one default that is prevented. What’s more, this requirement excludes 60 percent of loans given to African Americans, 50 percent given to Latinos, 50 percent given to low- and moderate-income borrowers, and 40 percent of loans given to middle-income borrowers during this period.</p>
<h3>3. FHA’s financial challenges are not due to its “government status” per se</h3>
<p>A central thrust of the Gyourko paper is that FHA’s major problem is that it is a government agency. Yet none of the analyses of the paper justify this claim. In fact, curiously, the most direct connection between FHA’s financial woes and its government status is that congressional oversight limits FHA’s flexibility to terminate programs or make major revisions to its programs.</p>
<p>The Gyourko paper pays significant attention to various modeling challenges such as the manner in which the FHA estimates the effects of unemployment. But those financial management decisions are not due to the FHA’s government status; they are due to the management team’s professional expertise and experience.</p>
<p>The Gyourko paper as relies on research of his AEI colleague Edward Pinto, but Pinto’s critiques also do not establish that FHA’s financial problems are per se related to its government status. Moreover, much of Pinto’s work rests on assumptions that are transparently biased and therefore undermine much of its value. An example of this framing can been seen in a <a href="http://www.nightmareatfha.com/how-the-fha-hurts-working-class-families-and-communities/">recent report</a> that examines the FHA 2009 and 2010 book years, a period Pinto <a href="http://www.aei.org/files/2013/01/29/-edward-pinto-fha-presentation_124146786409.pdf">considers</a> to be “well <em>after</em> the market’s collapse.” In reality, his data set begins months after the bailout of the country’s major financial institutions, the beginning of Fannie and Freddie’s conservatorship, and the freezing of the nation’s credit markets. Housing prices were still in free fall, and the 2009 book also includes a number of seller-finance down-payment-assistance loans.  Additionally, Pinto presents a correlation between FHA lending and high foreclosure rates in distressed neighborhoods to imply that the FHA is causing these foreclosure rates. In truth, these foreclosures are driven by the predatory lending pushed in these communities during the housing bubble.</p>
<p>FHA has implemented a fair number of policy changes that are designed to reduce its losses and make its lending programs more sustainable. Beyond banning seller-financed down-payment assistance, the FHA <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-113-ba00-wstate-cgalante-20130213.pdf">has also</a> improved its oversight of lenders, made its underwriting stricter—by requiring manual underwriting for borrowers with credit scores below 620 and DTI [debt-to-income] ratios over 43 percent and by increasing down-payment requirements for borrowers with credit scores below 580—and moved to sell its distressed assets more effectively. Crucially, the FHA has increased mortgage insurance premiums <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-113-ba00-wstate-cgalante-20130213.pdf">five times</a> since 2009 and has begun to collect annual premiums for the life of a loan. All of these changes will have a positive effect on the agency’s financial position.</p>
<p>The agency has also <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-113-ba00-wstate-cgalante-20130213.pdf">announced</a> it will improve its loss mitigation policies, streamline its short sale policy, and move forward with housing counseling incentives or requirements. All of these changes will likely save the agency money. Moving forward, FHA needs additional authority from Congress to manage its risk as effectively as possible. For example, the agency needs better authority to terminate lenders who show excessive rates of default or claims and to mandate the transfer of servicing rights from ineffective servicers.</p>
<p>In the HECM program, FHA is also moving forward with changes that will improve the program and prevent losses. The recently announced elimination of the fixed-rate standard HECM program will mean that borrowers should have a better ability to meet their tax and insurance obligations, thus preventing defaults. And the issuing of new incentives for estates to dispose of properties will also <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-113-ba00-wstate-cgalante-20130213.pdf">decrease the likelihood</a> that HUD will have to bear costs related to property disposition.</p>
<p>What’s more, the Reverse Mortgage Stabilization Act of 2013, which the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_23443489/house-gives-fha-flexibility-reverse-mortgages">House recently passed</a>, will give the FHA flexibility to implement changes to their programs using mortgagee letters rather than the often-lengthy rulemaking process. FHA <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-113-ba00-wstate-cgalante-20130213.pdf">plans to use</a> this authority to make changes that will directly address the HECM program’s observed problems, such as limiting the amount of allowed upfront draws and mandating tax and insurance set-asides.The FHA may also require a financial and credit assessment at loan origination and implement protections for spouses—reforms that could further strengthen the HECM program.</p>
<p>The real problem for FHA relating to its government status is not what AEI implies; rather, it is that the FHA needs authority to make sound business decisions in real time rather than being constrained by congressional oversight.</p>
<h3>4. Improvements in FHA’s management could enhance its financial well-being<span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;"> </span></h3>
<p>In addition to the policy changes already being pursued by FHA to improve its financial position, further enhancements to FHA’s operations might be extremely valuable. <a href="http://www.aei.org/files/2013/01/29/-edward-pinto-fha-presentation_124146786409.pdf">Pinto has argued</a> that the Veterans Affairs [or VA] mortgage program has a number of better practices than FHA. A number of these recommendations are worth considering. For example, we should examine the possible impact of imposing a residual income requirement at the FHA. We should also examine whether FHA’s seller concessions lead to higher default rates. It’s worth noting that HUD has been seeking to lower the amount of seller concessions since 2010. We should also study whether the VA property-appraisal process is more accurate than the process employed by FHA.</p>
<p>FHA can also learn from VA’s servicing procedures, which <a href="http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/FHA-mortgage-programs-servicing-hamp-1041594-1.html?pg=1">numerous</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/veterans-affairs-mortgage-program-avoids-the-pitfalls-of-other-lenders/2011/08/14/gIQAhbPcPJ_story.html">commentators</a> have argued is unique in its emphasis in intervening at the first indication a borrower might default. On a separate note, FHA could make improvements to its loss mitigation requirements. For example, by requiring servicers to provide clear proof that it complied with FHA’s loss mitigation guidelines before the agency pays out an insurance claim.</p>
<h3>5. A federally subsidized savings program for moderate-income families is an exceptional idea</h3>
<p>Gyourko’s paper proposes the establishment of a means-tested, government-subsidized savings program to replace FHA. Perhaps I am too much of a fiscal conservative, but replacing a government program—that has operated for more nearly 80 years, helped more than 40 million households to become homeowners, and has never cost the American taxpayer a single dollar to shore up its lending insurance fund—with a program that will cost taxpayers $1 billion per year while serving only a fraction of the current FHA program is an idea whose time will hopefully never come.</p>
<p>Having said that, the reality is that Americans do not save sufficiently and that lower- and moderate-income families face particularly large barriers to savings. As a result, we should consider a savings program with the general design features proposed in the Gyourko paper. And it is refreshing to have a conservative endorsing the importance of this idea.</p>
<p>Gyourko’s ideas to target the program to certain populations and to place restrictions on withdrawal are important components of his vision. Yet I do not agree that matched savings accounts should be managed through a mutual fund. Consumer savings would be safer and better managed through a less risky savings account at a local bank or credit union. Additionally, I believe there must be some flexibility regarding the government match; while restrictions are important, a borrower should not be penalized for missing his or her savings goal from time to time. I also believe the tax-free status is an unneeded tax expenditure that may inadvertently benefit higher-income participants. Lastly, I believe we should explore expanding such a program beyond housing. Lower-income households could use a wealth-building savings program for a variety of purposes, including starting a business, paying a child&#8217;s tuition, paying exceptional medical bills, and other necessities.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The paper “Rethinking the FHA” provides significant information on which to debate and discuss the current condition and future directions for the FHA. Unfortunately, the paper’s first sentence that “The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has failed by any reasonable metric” makes it clear the writing is not about offering a fair and balanced review of the FHA but rather to proclaim that the sky is falling and to elicit a radical and dramatic response. If policymakers heed that message, they could undermine one of the most successful and important government programs enacted in the past century.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that in this great time of turmoil within the housing market, particularly given the importance of homeownership to achieving the American Dream for the typical American family, that our debates and discussions cannot more genuinely focus on the real problems we face and the opportunities that lay ahead. But by asking me to comment on this paper, perhaps this could be a first step to dropping the rhetoric and working together as Americans for America.</p>

<p>How can tax policy strengthen the middle class?</p>
<p>This is the key question that policymakers should be asking themselves as they think about tax reform. Middle-class families are struggling as their incomes stagnate or fall and the costs of housing, education, and health care rise. A weak middle class holds back <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/report/2012/05/17/11628/the-american-middle-class-income-inequality-and-the-strength-of-our-economy/">economic growth</a> and undermines our <a href="http://www.democracyjournal.org/20/growth-and-the-middle-class.php?page=all">democracy</a>.</p>
<p>Tax policy can and should play a critical role in rebuilding the middle class.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for most of the past three decades, Congress has designed tax policy to benefit the top 1 percent of Americans under the “trickle-down” theory—that these so-called job creators will expand the economy for everyone. In fact, these supply-side tax policies have been clear failures; the economy works best when it grows from the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2013/02/21/54126/middle-out-economics-101/">middle out</a>.</p>

If the House of Representatives fails to pass immigration reform, the American economy will miss out on significant gains.</p><p>As the House of Representatives mulls over whether to move forward on immigration reform legislation, one point should be front and center in the debate: Maintaining the status quo is not cost neutral. Every day that Congress fails to pass immigration reform that enables the 11 million undocumented immigrants to earn legal status and citizenship is both a lost economic opportunity and a cost to all Americans.</p>
<p>Last month the Senate passed immigration reform legislation by a <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00168">bipartisan vote of 68-32</a>. Numerous <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/report/2013/03/20/57351/the-economic-effects-of-granting-legal-status-and-citizenship-to-undocumented-immigrants/">studies</a> and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href="http://cbo.gov/publication/44225">found</a> that the Senate’s bill would lead to significant economic growth as immigrants fully enter into our society and economy. Over the next 10 years, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, S. 744, would increase our gross domestic product, or GDP, by 3.3 percent and would raise the wages of all Americans by a cumulative $470<strong> </strong>billion, while creating on average 121,000 jobs each year.</p>
<p>In other words, if the House of Representatives fails to pass immigration reform, our country will forgo significant gains to our economy. Not only would it leave these gains behind, but the House also would guarantee that the United States continues to experience significant financial losses each year as a result of a broken immigration system. When these funds are lost, it is a loss to our local communities, our children’s education, and the retirement benefits of American retirees.</p>
<p>Two examples of the financial losses that result from maintaining the status quo are the underground labor force and diminished demand and consumption in the housing market.</p>
<h3>The underground labor force</h3>
<p>Throughout the debate over immigration reform, many people have described the undocumented population as “aspiring Americans living in the shadows.” This phrasing is not only poetic, but it also describes this population’s fear of deportation and accurately describes how these immigrants are marginalized from the formal economy. Our current broken immigration system creates shadow economies where millions of people live and work.</p>
<p>There are currently an estimated <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2011/02/01/unauthorized-immigrant-population-brnational-and-state-trends-2010/">8 million</a> undocumented immigrants working in the United States, which is more than 5 percent of the American workforce. With no means to work legally under current law, it is no surprise that the Social Security Administration estimates that close to <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/NOTES/pdf_notes/note151.pdf">two-thirds</a> of these immigrants work in an underground labor market where neither they nor their employers are able to legally declare their earnings or pay their payroll taxes. With only one-third of unauthorized immigrants working in the formal economy and contributing about <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/NOTES/pdf_notes/note151.pdf">$12 billion</a> in payroll taxes each year, we estimate that the United States loses around $20 billion in payroll tax revenue each year. Given that the Social Security Administration already pays out more in retirement benefits than it receives in taxes, this lost revenue would go a long way toward funding the retirement benefits of Americans across the country.</p>
<h3>The housing market</h3>
<p>In addition to pushing immigrants into an underground economy, our broken immigration system has kept millions of people from fully participating in their local communities and economies. This is perhaps most evident in the context of the housing market.</p>
<p>Research by the Pew Hispanic Center found that just <a href="http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/107.pdf">35 percent</a> of unauthorized immigrant households owned their own homes, compared to the 66 percent of naturalized-citizen homeowners. This low rate of homeownership among undocumented immigrants is not surprising, given that <a href="http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/107.pdf">18 percent</a> of them move each year either out of fear of deportation or an inability to find stable jobs because of their lack of status, compared to just 10 percent of immigrants with legal status.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, immigrants have contributed significantly to the health of our country’s housing market. Between 2000 and 2010 immigrants accounted for <a href="http://www.housingamerica.org/RIHA/RIHA/Publications/83654_12214_RIHA_Immigrant_Report.pdf">40 percent</a> of the growth in homeownership, and this trend is projected to continue through the next decade. But local communities stand to benefit significantly more if the purchasing power of undocumented immigrants is unleashed through reform that normalizes their immigration status. Simply put, our broken immigration system stifles immigrants’ natural tendency to purchase homes and contribute to our economy.</p>
<p>Rebounding housing markets—specifically, increased homeownership—is crucial to local communities’ recovery from the Great Recession. At the most basic level, homebuyers spur economic growth through all of the transactions and consumption associated with their purchases. The National Association of Realtors estimates that an average of <a href="http://nahrep.org/immigration-reform">$60,000</a> is spent in associated purchases—for example, the cost of movers—when a home is bought. In addition to the consumption associated with buying a home, research has found that immigrant homeownership increases the property values of all homeowners and subsequently leads to greater property tax revenues for communities. All homeowners win when home prices rise.</p>
<p>If undocumented immigrants were provided legal status and were able to become full members of our society, many of them would decide to purchase homes, similar to their legal counterparts. This would mean that immigrants would settle down in communities all across the country, buy homes, and invest in their communities, contributing greatly to local economies.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Last month the Senate took a giant step toward reaping the economic benefits of immigration reform. The potential to add billions of dollars to our economy should in and of itself be sufficient motivation to spur the House of Representatives to act. But if not, the House at a minimum must understand that a vote for the status quo is a vote for continuing the financial losses that burden our country.<em></em></p>

<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is often considered the second most important court in the land, after the Supreme Court. The D.C. Circuit has sole responsibility for deciding cases having to do with the <strong>balance of powers of the branches of government </strong>and decisions made by government agencies affecting issues like <strong>health care, national security, environmental rules, and consumer protections and workplace safety</strong>. More U.S. Supreme Court justices have come from the D.C. Circuit than any other circuit court, including four current Justices.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>three of the court’s eleven seats remain vacant</strong>, including one seat that has been unfilled since 2005. These vacancies have a crippling effect on the court’s ability to decide on critically key cases that impact the lives of Americans across the country, regardless of where they we live. In recent years, the D.C. Circuit’s composition (majority of judges are Republican-appointed) means that the court has a history of siding with corporate and industry interests over individual consumers, and has presented a host of obstacles for progressives, including blocking Wall Street reforms, reversing labor dispute decisions, and rolling back environmental protections.</p>
<p><strong>Regardless of where you live or the issues you care about, the D.C. Circuit makes decisions on issues that matter to you. </strong>Consider some of the issues the D.C. Circuit has decided in recent years:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>The environment: </strong></strong>In 2012, the court struck down the Environmental Protection Agency’s “Transport Rule” intended to control air pollution that crosses state lines.</li>
<li><strong>Labor disputes and consumer protections:</strong> In 2013, the court invalidated the President’s three recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board and an appointment to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, essentially making the NLRB non-functional and potentially nullifying over 200 labor and employment decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Wall Street reform:</strong> In 2011, the court struck down the Securities and Exchange Commission’s proxy access rule, which would have made it easier for shareholders to propose their own nominees to the corporate board of directors.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Health protections and deceptive advertising: </strong></strong>In 2012, the court struck down an FDA cigarette warning label law, citing the first amendment rights of cigarette companies.</li>
<li><strong>National security:</strong> Since 2008, the circuit court has blatantly disregarded a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the right to habeas corpus for Guantanamo Bay detainees and ignored the requirement that the circuit conduct a robust review of prisoners’ detainment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>D.C Circuit quick facts</h3>
<p><strong>By law, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is the court with jurisdiction over certain critical issues affecting all Americans, such as: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consumer protections and labor rights</li>
<li>Environmental and health regulations</li>
<li>National security issues</li>
<li>Crucially – in an era of hyperpartisanship – the balance of powers between branches of government</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>By law, the D.C. Circuit currently has 11 seats. Today, three of those judgeships are vacant. Of the eight active judges: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Three were appointed by President George W. Bush</li>
<li>Three were appointed by President Bill Clinton</li>
<li>One was appointed by President George H.W. Bush</li>
<li>One of President Obama’s nominees was confirmed on May 23, 2013</li>
<li>All but one of the senior judges, who still hear cases, are Republican appointees</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><strong>The caseload for each active judge has increased almost 38 percent since 2005. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are currently 1419 pending cases split among eight active judges, which is more than 177 cases per judge.</li>
<li>There were 1313 pending cases split among 11 judges in 2005, which is more than 119 cases per judge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The caseload per judge is greater than other Circuit Courts and the cases heard are much more complex. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The D.C. Circuit hears an unusually large number of major regulatory and national security cases, many of which require very specialized legal research, involve intensely long records, and take more time for a judge to process than four or five normal cases heard in other circuits.</li>
<li>The caseloads outside of the D.C. Circuit include many routine sentencing, immigration and other cases of the kinds that are often dispatched with in brief orders drafted by staff attorneys (who then have these orders approved by judges).</li>
<li>Both the 8th and 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals have fewer cases per judge than the D.C. Circuit and the Senate recently confirmed judges to both of these courts.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><strong>Under the majority of Republican-appointed judges on the D.C. Circuit, the court has leaned to the conservative right, and become hostile to consumer and environmental protections.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recent D.C. Circuit decisions have weakened environmental protections, overturned carefully considered cigarette warning label requirements, rolled back the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms, and invalidated appointments to consumer protection and labor relations agencies.</li>
<li>The D.C. Circuit has become far more likely than its sister circuits to second-guess a federal agency’s decision. Other circuit courts reverse agency decisions roughly 15 percent of the time, while the D.C. circuit’s reversal rate is 50 percent higher.</li>
<li>Filling the vacancies on the court could go a long way to restoring the ability of the federal government to respond to health and safety concerns that impact every American.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The President has nominated three people – Patricia Ann Millett, “Nina” Pillard, and Judge Robert L. Wilkins – to fill the remaining vacancies on the D.C. Circuit.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These nominees are highly-qualified, non-ideological lawyers with strong credentials and professional experience.</li>
<li>They will bring diversity and a wealth of experience to the D.C. Circuit Court.</li>
<li>All have received the nonpartisan ABA’s highest rating.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Even though there are currently three vacancies on the 11-seat D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, Senate Republicans have signaled that they plan block any additional D.C. Circuit nominations made by President Obama. Sen. Grassley, the leading Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has proposed legislation that would strip the number of judges on the D.C. Circuit from 11 to 8, thereby denying President Obama the opportunity to appoint any new judges to the court, and creating an even bigger backlog of cases on this important court. </em><strong><em>Here are the facts you need to know:</em></strong></p>
<h3>Sen. Grassley&#8217;s proposal is pure partisan politics and not based on fact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Senator Grassley’s proposal is to weaken the DC Circuit Court by eliminating three seats, just so President Obama can&#8217;t fill them &#8212; even though these are the same seats that these GOP senators helped fill with ideologues nominated under Bush. Grassley simply wants to impose his extreme political ideology on the American people and will weaken the nation’s second most important court to do so.</li>
<li>The hyper-partisan bill would slash nearly 30% of the seats on the D.C. Circuit without any evidence that cuts to this important court is warranted. The proposal ignores the fact that Congress previously authorized 11 judgeships on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals based on the number of cases the court receives and the complexity of those cases. The nonpartisan Federal Judicial Conference that is chaired by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts recommended that the D.C. Circuit should continue to have 11 judgeships.[1]</li>
<li>Although Sen. Grassley claims there isn’t enough work on the D.C. Circuit compared to other circuits, his math is fuzzy and the argument ignores the complexity of the cases to score partisan points. Sen. Grassley claimed there are only 108 cases per judge on the D.C. Circuit. According to the Administrative Office of the Courts, however, there are 1,419 pending cases split among eight judges, which adds up to more than 177 cases/judge.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Grassley proposal is hypocritical and amounts to a partisan filibuster</h3>
<ul>
<li>This effort is opposition for opposition sake and another example of partisan Republicans’ attempt to shut down the federal government.</li>
<li>Although he opposes President Obama’s nominees, Sen. Grassley had no problem confirming judges to fill the tenth and eleventh seats on the D.C. Circuit when George W. Bush was president. In 2005, Grassley voted to confirm Judges Janice Rogers Brown and Thomas Griffith, the tenth and eleventh judges at the time, to the D.C. Circuit. The caseload per authorized judge then (109) was smaller than it is now (129).[2]</li>
<li>Changes in the number of federal judgeships usually begin at the beginning of a new presidential term to avoid taking action. Senator Grassley admits that this bill ignores that policy and is intended to strip the President of his constitutional duty to appoint federal court immediately.[3]</li>
<li>Senator Grassley had no problem adding judges to courts with caseloads lower than the DC Circuit</li>
<ul>
<li>In May 2013, the Senate confirmed Jane Kelly (from Grassley’s home state of Iowa) to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals just 34 days after her approval by the Judiciary Committee. That court has the lowest caseload per active judge of any circuit court in the country. Grassley did not raise any concerns over whether that vacancy had to be filled because of a workload concern. Why is this argument suddenly relevant only with the D.C. Circuit?</li>
<li>Similarly, Robert Bacharach, supported by both Republican Senators from his home state of Oklahoma, was confirmed to a seat to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year, which hears far fewer cases than the D.C. Circuit.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>The D.C. Circuit hears complex, time-consuming cases and needs a full panel of judges.</h3>
<ul>
<li>The D.C. Circuit hears an unusually large number of major regulatory and national security cases, many of which require very specialized legal research, involve intensely long records, and take more time for a judge to process than four or five normal cases heard in other circuits.</li>
<ul>
<li>The caseloads outside of the D.C. Circuit include many routine sentencing, immigration and other cases of the kinds that are often dispatched with in brief orders drafted by staff attorneys (who then have these orders approved by judges). The D.C. Circuit, by contrast, hears far fewer of these easy cases that require very little work on the part of judges.</li>
</ul>
<li>As former D.C. Circuit Chief Judge Pat Wald &#8212; who served on that court for more than twenty years &#8212; has explained: “The D.C. Circuit hears the most complex, time-consuming, labyrinthine disputes over regulations with the greatest impact on ordinary Americans’ lives: clean air and water regulations, nuclear plant safety, health-care reform issues, insider trading and more. These cases can require thousands of hours of preparation by the judges, often consuming days of argument, involving hundreds of parties and interveners, and necessitating dozens of briefs and thousands of pages of record – all of which culminates in lengthy, technically intricate legal opinions.”</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Elections have consequences and President Obama has a constitutional obligation to bring the D.C. Circuit to full strength</h3>
<ul>
<li>President Obama, just like every other president before him, has the constitutional obligation to fill judicial vacancies, the number of which is determined by law passed by Congress. Grassley’s proposal to strip the D.C. Circuit of seats is akin to “reverse court packing” intended to strengthen his partisan ideals and maintain a conservative D.C. Circuit Court.</li>
<li>President Obama is the first president since Woodrow Wilson to go a full term without getting a single nominee confirmed to the D.C. Circuit.</li>
<li>Every other president since Jimmy Carter has appointed at least three judges to the D.C. Circuit. Ronald Reagan: 8 confirmations; George H.W. Bush: 3 confirmations; Bill Clinton: 3 confirmations; George W. Bush (43): 4 confirmations.</li>
</ul>

<p>[2] On March 31, 2005 &#8212; the date closest to the confirmations of Brown and Griffith for which these figures published by the U.S. Courts exist &#8212; there were 1,313 cases pending in the D.C. Circuit, which at the time had 12 authorized judgeships, or 109 cases per authorized judge (the metric used by Senator Grassley). As of December 31, 2012, there were 1,419 pending cases in the D.C. Circuit, or 129 cases per authorized judge, the figure cited by Senator Grassley as so low that three judgeships should be eliminated.</p>

<blockquote><p>Chairman Hensarling has released the ultimate right-wing wish list, turning the entire mortgage market over to Wall Street lock, stock, and barrel. It&#8217;s a politically motivated sideshow that ignores the general consensus forming around the government’s role in a responsible market and threatens not only the nascent housing recovery but also prospects for overall economic growth.</p>
<p>If enacted, Chairman Hensarling’s legislation would eliminate the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage; put homeownership out of reach for millions of young borrowers, communities of colors, and low-wealth families; further constrict the already-inadequate supply of affordable rental housing; and leave the housing market fully exposed to the private market’s cyclical fluctuations. This is not a serious legislative proposal. Rather, House Financial Services Committee Republicans are filing a PAC fundraising letter with the clerk of the House.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chairman Hensarling’s legislation would wind down Fannie and Freddie within five years, completely eliminate the government backstop to the mortgage market, and replace it with nothing more than a public utility-securitization mechanism featuring standardized contracts and disclosures. It also would eviscerate the FHA, dramatically cutting back on government insurance, limiting eligibility to first-time and lower-income homebuyers, and instituting higher down-payment requirements.</p>

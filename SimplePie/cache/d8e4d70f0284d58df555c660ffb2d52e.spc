It stretches across a giant valley that has been carved away by the Oldman River. It’s a beautiful area in the heart of the city. The river is surrounded by rolling hills, and the university sits atop them like a boat carried by the waves of the sea. The valley is so deep and just wide enough, that were a train to go down into it, even gradually, it would never come back out. So in an effort to prevent trains from being swallowed in the belly of Lethbridge, early workers built the bridge across the valley. Trains don’t have to dip or climb: they just go straight across. Over 300 feet tall and 1.6 kilometers long (just under one mile), the High Level Bridge, as it’s called, is the largest of its kind. It was completed in 1909 by manly men who probably all had moustaches or beards, wore suspenders or flannel suits, didn’t have safety equipment, and had never driven a car. And I don’t understand how they did it. The bridge has always fascinated me. And from all angles &#8211; from the highways on both sides, underneath it, and even on top of it; whenever I really look at it, I’m in awe. It&#8217;s the symbol of the city and its main attraction. People have their picture taken by it, it’s on postcards, and a Google image search of “Lethbridge” fills the screen with mostly pictures of the bridge. It <i>is</i> Lethbridge, and in a sense, my whole experience living there revolved around the bridge.</p> <p>Early on in my time in Lethbridge, I mentioned in conversation how fascinated I was by the bridge and how I would love to know how it was built. The person I was talking with happened to have recently visited the local museum, where a video is regularly shown that documents the construction of the bridge. Perfect. I was talking to the right person at the right time and my problem was solved. A gift from the universe. But I spit in the universe’s face. Despite my deep interest in the topic, the proximity of the museum, the low admission fee, my flexible student schedule, and the fact that the experience would provide me <i>exactly</i> what I was looking for, I never went. The whole time I lived there, I never went.</p> <p>I’ve thought about this many times. Why didn’t I ever go? Why wouldn’t I do something so easy &#8211; something <i>I wanted to do</i>?</p> <h3><b>Theory of Doing Things</b></h3> <p>Bored out of his mind in Mundare, Alberta (population 855), Albert Bandura decided to grow up to become a world-famous psychologist. And what Albert Bandura decides to do, Albert Bandura does. Now among the most cited psychologists, and clearly a doer of things, Bandura is the authority on getting things done. His Social Cognitive Theory revolves around the concept of <i>self-efficacy</i>. According to Bandura, self-efficacy is, “the belief in one’s capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.” In other words, self-efficacy is your belief in your own ability to do the things you want to do.</p> <p>People with high levels of self-efficacy:</p> <ul> <li>See problems as challenges to overcome, or tasks to be mastered. Even completing small tasks is a source of satisfaction.</li> <li>Develop deep interests and are active participants in various activities. Interests grow and develop and the world seems big.</li> <li>Form a strong sense of commitment to their interests. They don’t go half-way, or start projects and give up quickly.</li> <li>Recover quickly from setbacks and disappointments.</li> </ul> <p>Whereas people with low levels of self-efficacy:</p> <ul> <li>Avoid challenges (or inconveniences) &#8211; big or small (or even very small).</li> <li>Believe difficult things are beyond their abilities. They see other people doing things and assume the position of observer, not participant.</li> <li>Focus on their personal failings. They don’t give themselves credit.</li> <li>Lose confidence easily and quickly, giving up on new things when they’re difficult, uncomfortable, or just different.</li> </ul> <p>I believe the answer to why I didn’t do an easy, and probably enjoyable, thing, lies in this concept of self-efficacy.</p> <p>But what about doing hard things?</p> <h3><b>A Thing I Did</b></h3> <p>The bed was a little wider than my body and not quite as long. It sunk in the middle so it was more like a hammock or a trampoline than a bed. And the blanket was thick and stiff, suspended over the bed like a tarp on a canoe. I had been cold and lost and alone, but found my way to my room to regroup and recuperate. The room smelled like sulfur and I didn’t know what time it was. I didn’t know what time I arrived in Iceland, but found that it was earlier than stores opened. With no coat, no watch, no friends, no map, and no way to get any of those things, finding my room was a victory. Being alone in a strange place hit me hard, so I crumpled myself into my little nook and went to sleep. The nap was a success, and I soon turned things around and had a wonderful three days by myself in Iceland.</p> <p>I had always wanted to go to Iceland. So I went. I spent three days alone there, finding my way around, doing activities, learning some of the culture, navigating the lunar landscape (a tour I went on informed me that NASA took their astronauts to Iceland to get a feel for what it would be like on the moon), getting goods and services without knowing the language, adjusting to the time change and the never-setting sun, exploring and going on excursions, and overcoming low spirits to relax and enjoy. By all accounts, doing all that was much harder than driving down the street to go to a museum. Both were things I wanted to do; I did the hard one and never got around to the easy one. Why? It would be easy to say that going to Iceland is more interesting than going to the museum in Lethbridge, but I believe my fascination with that bridge was equal to my desire to see Iceland. Self-efficacy can provide some answers.</p> <h3><b>Bandura’s Theory of Doing Things, Again</b></h3> <p>According to Bandura, self-efficacy is deep-rooted. It develops in four main ways:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Social modeling.</strong> Seeing other people succeed raises our belief that we too can succeed. This is especially true when the person is within our sphere of influence. We may think things like, “If that regular schmo can do it, I can too.” But it can also go the other way: “If that awesome dude can’t do it, why should I be able to?”</li> <li><strong>Social persuasion.</strong> Encouragement from others makes it easier to do things, and discouragement makes it harder. This can be obvious or subtle. Not getting the encouragement we’re hoping for, even with no direct discouragement, can severely weaken our ability to do things. This shows how fragile self-efficacy can be when not tended to.</li> <li><strong>Mastery experiences.</strong> Bandura says this is the most effective way to develop self-efficacy. Succeeding makes further success easier to attain. But it almost seems stronger going the other way. One failure, no matter how minor, can be a huge blow. Again, self-efficacy is a fragile thing when left on its own.</li> <li><strong>Psychological responses.</strong> Our moods, feelings, physical reactions, stress levels, and other states of mind can affect our levels of self-efficacy. But Bandura notes, “It is not the sheer intensity of emotional and physical reactions that is important, but rather how they are perceived and interpreted.” We can take charge by being aware of them and how they affect our self-efficacy.</li> </ul> <p>But why didn’t I go to the museum?</p> <p>I mentioned above that people with high levels of self-efficacy have deep interests, form deep commitments, recover quickly from setbacks, and take satisfaction from completing tasks and overcoming challenges. People with low levels lose interest and give up easily, remain uninvolved, focus on their failings, and avoid challenges and tasks. So according to that definition, I have both high levels <i>and </i>low levels of self-efficacy: I make deep commitments, have deep interests, and overcome challenges, but also give up easily, and avoid tasks.</p> <p>My own experience tells me that we can have different levels of self-efficacy in different areas, or for different types of tasks. It seems that I have higher self-efficacy in doing more involved things, and low self-efficacy when it comes to smaller tasks. We could categorize tasks in many ways: big, small, medium, long-term, short-term, involved, straightforward, complex, simple, and so on. And I believe if we plotted our levels of self-efficacy on a graph, with self-efficacy on the vertical axis and categories of tasks on the horizontal axis, and connected the dots, most people would have a mountain range. It would be really high in some areas, really low in others, and everything in between. But just as seeing ourselves succeed makes further success more likely, looking at our high levels in one area makes it easier to increase those levels in another. Remembering that I can do big things makes it easier to do small things. And if it’s the other way for you &#8211; small tasks are easier but you avoid big things &#8211; remember that big things are just a lot of small things piled on top of each other.</p> <h3><b>So how do we increase our levels of self-efficacy? </b></h3> <p>The first step is to know yourself. What types of tasks give you difficulty? No one finds everything difficult, but everyone probably struggles with something. Examine your life. Think small for now. Imagine yourself going through a normal day. What do you put off for later? What do you get done right away? Here’s an example from my own life. A typical Ian day:</p> <p>The alarm goes off at 7:00 AM, and I hit the snooze button and get up at 7:10, or sometimes I hit it again and get up at 7:20. If I get up at 7:20 I have to skip breakfast and pick something up at the cafeteria on my way to my office at the college. This late riser’s breakfast is usually a giant muffin and 2% milk. The muffin is delicious but too sweet and it usually gives me the jitters, and by lunchtime I don’t feel like eating. It’s safe to say two snoozes is too many.</p> <p>I head to the shower where I use a giant bottle of shampoo I bought from the dollar store. I didn’t know there’s a difference between shampoos, because I am a man. Now I know there is a difference. The one I use seems to be made of barely more than water, and <i>I guess</i> my hair feels <i>a bit </i>cleaner after using it. I should replace it.</p> <p>I only shave on days my beard feels itchy, even though I don’t look good after two or three days.</p> <p>I get dressed and if there’s time, eat breakfast. If I can get up at 7:00, I have time for eggs and toast. But I don’t usually. So it’s just toast. Not bad, but the protein from the eggs makes me feel virile and supercharged, and I miss it when I don’t have it.</p> <p>I drive to work in my car with the burnt out signal light and overused oil and park far from the office because I enjoy the walk. I get to my office and sign on to work email, which is usually empty, and personal email, which is usually full. I keep my phone on my desk and respond to texts and emails as they arrive. I have intermittent periods of focus throughout the day. I wonder if I have Attention Deficit Disorder, or if I’m just a modern human. The project I’m working on at work is very interesting, and I have innovative and exciting ideas about it, but only manage to focus on it in short spurts. When a thought comes to mind, I act on it &#8211; no matter how unimportant or unrelated it is. The internet on my computer is very fast, and I can find answers to my stupid questions very quickly. <i>Is Channing Tatum in both G.I. Joe movies? </i>BAM! Imdb. <i>I wonder how some people rack up so many frequent flyer miles. </i>BAM! Travel blogs everywhere. <i>Did Stephanie Meyer think of the idea for The Host before or after Twilight? </i>BAM! Um&#8230;I don’t know where I’d find that one. I’ve never actually wondered that, but you get the idea. Each of these detours lead to more and sometimes I’ll go for a while before realizing I’m off-track. Then I’ll get back on track, get on a roll, and make major progress on my project. And then it happens again. Whenever possible I do my work off of the computer to avoid this problem.</p> <p>I come home for lunch because I enjoy seeing my family, and the food there is freer and healthier than what I’d get at work.</p> <p>After work I make a list of things I want to get done that evening. An old note in front of me now has two tasks related to the business I’m starting, and one administrative task. I did the two business related ones, and still haven’t done the other.</p> <p>I spend time with my family. Now that the weather is nice, we try to do something outside and avoid watching tv or movies. We’ve gone on picnics, walks, played at the park, threw the ball for the dog, and other things. My family is the most important part of my life, and I make it a priority to spend time with them, even when I have other things to do.</p> <p>We read before bed because we both enjoy it. We do it even when we get too bed late.</p> <h3><b>My Self-Efficacy Strengths and Weaknesses</b></h3> <p><b>Strengths:</b></p> <p>I’ll start here because the weaknesses are more obvious.</p> <ul> <li>I’m good at working on big things and things that have long-term impact. This includes the project at work.</li> <li>When I set priorities, I stick with them. Time with my family is non-negotiable. I think reading is one of the better ways to use time, so I make sure to do it regularly. I’m conscious of my health. That doesn’t mean I always make the right choice, but choosing to eat at home is a good choice that I make regularly.</li> </ul> <p><b>Weaknesses:</b></p> <ul> <li>I’m bad at small things.</li> <li>I snooze.</li> <li>I use gross shampoo.</li> <li>I sacrifice a good breakfast.</li> <li>I shave as little as possible.</li> <li>I ignore problems with the car because I can’t be bothered to take the time to do the minor repairs.</li> <li>I get easily distracted at work.</li> <li>I only do items on my list that will bring long-term benefits.</li> <li>And so on.</li> </ul> <p>It’s a bit humbling to look at how much I suck. But it’s a good start to figuring out how to suck less.</p> <p>I encourage you to do the same exercise. Think about your day, and print off this page and fill in these blanks (or write your answers on another piece of paper at least &#8211; but actually do it, fellow Manly Doer of Things).</p> <blockquote><p>Strengths:</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>List 5 things you got done today.</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p> <p>Weaknesses:</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>List 5 things you should have done today, but didn’t do.</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p></blockquote> <p>The weaknesses should be easier to spot. But focus on your strengths. When you understand your strengths &#8211; the areas where your self-efficacy is high &#8211; you can understand how to improve your weaknesses. Let’s look at me again.</p> <p>I’m good at doing long-term or complex things, and avoid doing smaller and simpler things. It’s much easier to buy a bottle of shampoo than it is to build a business. It might be easy to say I’m more excited about building a business than I am about getting shampoo. And that might be true. But when I do finally get around to replacing the shampoo, I’ll feel very satisfied and look forward to using it. <b>Completing any task always brings some level of satisfaction</b>. Often the satisfaction level is the same from completing small tasks as it is from completing big ones. But I avoid the smaller tasks.</p> <p>When I look closely, I see how little this makes sense. <b>Any long-term, big, complex, complicated, multi-faceted, in-depth task is just a bunch of small tasks in a row. And there are no exceptions. </b>Completing each of these small tasks is no more satisfying than buying a new bottle of shampoo. Even just keeping that in mind helps make any type of small task more manageable.</p> <p>Or we could look at it the other way around.</p> <p>If I’m motivated by long-term benefits, it helps to realize that each small task has a long term benefit. And again, <b>there are no exceptions. </b>They may not be earth-changing benefits, but they are benefits. Fixing my car will save me money on more serious repairs later. New shampoo will keep my hair healthier, because there’s no way the slime I use now does it any good. Getting up one snooze earlier means better breakfast and better health.</p> <p>But maybe your self-assessment had the opposite results.</p> <p>Maybe you’re good at getting every item on your list done, but you have big dreams, goals, plans, or tasks that you don’t bother with.</p> <p>I think you already know what to do. But to illustrate, here’s a story. Anne Lamott relates the story behind the title of her guide to writing, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SEGI8Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B000SEGI8Q&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20" target="_blank"><em>Bird by Bird</em></a>:</p> <blockquote><p>&#8220;Thirty years ago my older brother, who was ten years old at the time, was trying to get a report on birds written that he&#8217;d had three months to write.

We were out at our  family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen  table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper  and pencils and unopened books on birds,  immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my brother&#8217;s shoulder, and said, &#8216;Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote> <p>Remember, big tasks are just a bunch of little tasks piled on top of each other. Use what you know about getting small things done. Start small, and take it task by task.</p> <p>Understanding is a giant step to overcoming. Thinking like Bad-Ass Bandura (as his friends probably called him) &#8212; consciously tending to your self-efficacy and realizing it is a driving force behind your actions or inactions &#8212; will open up your whole life and jump-start your progress as a man. Few things are manlier or more satisfying than doing exactly what you set out to do.</p> <p>_____________________</p> <p><em>Ian Walker is a normal guy with a good life who wants to enjoy it even more.

But as they pick up and examine the present tucked inside, their smile quickly fades. “You know, this watch really isn’t right for me. Here, you can have it back.”</p> <p>Ouch. Such behavior is so uncommon you may (thankfully) never have witnessed it or done it yourself. Yet the majority of us regularly do something very similar when it comes to accepting another kind of “gift”: compliments.</p> <p>Even though <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/12/13/too-seldom-is-heard-an-encouraging-word-why-and-how-to-offer-more-compliments/">we should all be offering more compliments</a>, many of us struggle to do so. And yet graciously accepting compliments can be a challenge as well. We’re eager to get them and so pleased when we do, but then we utterly fumble their receipt. Instead of accepting compliments with pleasure and appreciation, we look for ways to downgrade, reject, and deflect their significance and value.</p> <p>Learning how to best take a compliment is pretty easy (even if changing an ingrained behavior takes some practice). You simply have to understand 1) how you dismiss compliments, 2) why you have trouble accepting them outright, and 3) why and how you can graciously acknowledge and accept the praise of others.</p> <h3><b>10 Ways Compliments Are Dismissed</b></h3> <p>Sociolinguists place compliment responses into 3 main categories: Accept, Deflect, and Reject. These categories represent a spectrum, and most people aren’t uncomfortable at either extreme; outright denial seems rude but full acceptance feels conceited. Thus, most people seek what seems like a safe middle ground, choosing a deflecting response that dilutes and mitigates the compliment. They see compliments as hot potatoes that need to be tossed on as soon as they land in their hands.</p> <p>In <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1572242094/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1572242094&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20">The Assertiveness Workbook</a></i>, Randy Paterson lists some of the different ways we reject and deflect compliments, to which I’ve added a few I’ve observed myself.</p> <p><b>1. Ignore</b></p> <p>The recipient ignores the compliment, either because he didn’t hear it, or because he doesn’t recognize that he’s being complimented.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “You played crazy good today – you were all over the court.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Yeah, I’m really thirsty. Let’s stop for some Gatorade on the way home.”</i></p> <p><b>2. Denial</b></p> <p>The recipient denies the compliment outright.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “You guys sounded so good tonight.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Yeah right. We sounded like total crap.”  </i></p> <p><b>3. Arguing</b></p> <p>The recipient of the compliment argues against his deserving the given praise.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “That was a really profound insight you brought up in class.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Not really. Anyone who had read the previous cases would have come to the same conclusion.” </i></p> <p><b>4. Self-Insult</b></p> <p>The receiver downplays the praise by offering self-deprecating remarks.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “That’s a really spiffy hat.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Well I need something to draw attention from my ugly mug!”</i></p> <p><b>5. Questioning</b></p> <p>The receiver questions the giver’s judgment, taste, etc. in offering the compliment.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “Your photography is definitely the best exhibit here.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Are you kidding? You must not have gone to very many art shows in your life.”</i></p> <p><b>6. Narrowing</b></p> <p>The receiver whittles down a broader compliment into a smaller one.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “You’re looking really dashing tonight.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “This tie can make any suit look good.”</i></p> <p><b>7. Boomerang</b></p> <p>In response to a compliment, the receiver fires one back.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “That is one sweet ‘stache!”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Well that’s a heck of a manly beard you’ve got there!”</i></p> <p><b>8. Reassurance</b></p> <p>The receiver has trouble accepting the compliment and seeks confirmation.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “Your speech was incredibly convincing.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Do you really think so? I felt like I was floundering out there.”</i></p> <p><b>9. De-Value</b></p> <p>The recipient suggests that the thing being complimented isn’t as great as the complimenter is suggesting.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “That’s a really handsome sweater.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “It’s so old. I’ve had it since high school.”</i></p> <p><b>10. Credit Transfer</b></p> <p>The recipient transfers the praise to others.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “I think that was the best dance we’ve ever had.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “It was really Jill who did all the work and made it happen.” </i></p> <h3><b>Why We Deflect Compliments</b></h3> <p>Paterson gives the following reasons for why people struggle to fully accept a compliment, to which I’ve again added a couple reasons I also think bear mentioning.</p> <p><b>Fear of being seen as conceited.</b> This is by far the most common reason people deflect a compliment. They worry that by agreeing with someone else’s praise of them, they are essentially praising themselves and thus being smug.</p> <p><b>The need to restore “balance.”</b> Since a compliment is a positive act, you may feel a psychological need to balance things out by either negating the praise through deflection, or by quickly returning the compliment.</p> <p><b>The desire to avoid “indebtedness.”</b> This is the worry that if someone does something nice for you like offering a compliment, you will then “owe” them something nice in return and will thus be indebted to them in some way.</p> <p><b>Having low self-esteem.</b> If someone says something nice about you that you don’t believe about yourself, your immediate reaction will be to deny or disbelieve it. You can’t integrate the complimenter’s positive view of you into your own negative one, so you look for ways to find their assessment faulty – i.e., they missed the mistakes you made or they don’t have good judgment.</p> <p><b>Inability to be assertive.</b> Guys who struggle with <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/02/12/how-to-be-assertive/">being assertive</a> often find accepting compliments to be a struggle. They have a hard time taking ownership of their positive qualities and feel like acknowledging praise isn’t something a “nice guy” would do.</p> <p><b>Suspicion of motives.</b> You may reject someone’s compliments if you’re suspicious that they’re just trying to flatter you and butter you up for some reason. This suspicion may be legitimate or it may come from an overly cynical worldview and be rooted in trust issues.</p> <p><b>Desire to look even better.</b> People will sometimes use false modesty as a way of trying to make themselves look even better. For example, Bob compliments Jake on giving a top-notch presentation, and Jake, who actually spent a few dozen hours preparing it, says, “Oh, it was just something I threw together.” Now Bob is thinking, “Wow, if he just threw that together, imagine what he could do if he spent a lot of time on something!” Alternatively, someone may seek to add modesty to the other qualities they’re being complimented on. So Mike tells Andy, “I really appreciate how thorough you made this report.” To which Andy responds, “It was nothing. Just doing my job.” Andy may want Mike to think, “He’s not only a diligent employee, but so humble to boot!”</p> <h3><b>Why You Should Graciously and Fully Accept Compliments</b></h3> <p>Sociolinguists have found that Americans respond to compliments with a deflecting response a whopping two-thirds of the time. While this kind of response may be popular, it’s not very smart or even polite. This is an area where you should definitely try to break the mold of the mainstream. Here’s why.</p> <p><b>Denial and deflection insults the giver.</b> When someone offers you a compliment, they’re saying that they’ve observed and assessed a praiseworthy quality in you. When you deflect or deny that praise, you’re basically contradicting them; you’re saying that they don’t have good judgment, discernment, or taste, or that they’re insincere – that they don’t know what they’re talking about. You’re returning their kind words with an insult.</p> <p><b>Denial and deflection make the giver feel uncomfortable.</b> When we dismiss a compliment because it makes us uncomfortable, we simply transfer that discomfort to the giver. Not only do you insult them, but as Paterson puts it, rejecting a compliment often makes the giver feel “awkward, uncomfortable, stupid, or frustrated.” Where do they go from there? They’re now stuck with the tiresome task of offering reassurance of their sincerity…”No I really do think so…”</p> <p>Be a man and eat the discomfort yourself instead of tossing it back like a hot potato.</p> <p><b>Denial and deflection decrease the likelihood of someone complimenting you again.</b> When you always wave off people&#8217;s compliments, eventually they won’t bother to offer them at all anymore.</p> <p><b>Denial and deflection diminishes your value.</b> A compliment shows that someone sees value in you. When you dismiss those compliments you’re telling them that either you do not have the qualities they thought you did, or that you’re so insecure you can’t even recognize and/or acknowledge that you do. Either way, it diminishes your value in their eyes. This makes you unattractive to the ladies who like a man to be confident. It also isn’t impressive to your employer. If you’re always telling your boss that so-and-so is really the one who deserves all the credit for the success on a project, why should they give you a raise or even keep you around?</p> <p><b>You lose out on the good feeling that comes with a compliment.</b> Getting a nice compliment can make you feel great. But when you deflect and devalue the compliment instead of absorbing it, you also deflect the positive boost it could have given your self-esteem.</p> <p><b>Boomerang compliments aren’t usually sincere.</b> You may think that always responding to a compliment with one of your own is polite, but it’s not. A boomerang compliment signals that instead of <i>listening</i> to and absorbing someone’s praise, you were busy formulating your own compliment. And because people know it’s a knee-jerk behavior that’s designed to mitigate your own discomfort, that it’s more about <i>you</i> than it is about <i>them, </i>it doesn’t register as sincere. It’s far better to offer your own compliment at another, appropriate time, so that it comes off as spontaneous and authentic, rather than coerced. There are exceptions to this rule, of course (see below).</p> <h3><b>How to Accept a Compliment</b></h3> <p>The first step in quitting the faux modesty of the compliment deflection routine is to realize that fully accepting compliments does not make you conceited. You didn’t come up with the praise yourself, someone else did! You’re just confirming another person’s assessment, and again, it’s more polite to accept and appreciate their judgment rather than to contradict it.</p> <p>Second, it’s okay to let yourself feel proud of something you did well. A little pride need not involve an inflated sense of your accomplishments or worthy qualities – just an honest assessment of what you did. It’s quite possible to be modest, while still being grateful and gracious.</p> <p>So what’s the best response to a compliment? Get ready for it…”<i><strong>Thank you</strong>.”</i> That’s it. There’s never a situation where a simple, unadorned thank you won’t work.</p> <p>That being said, sometimes it’s more comfortable and quite appropriate to offer a follow-up to your “thank you,” or an amplifier that shows just how much the compliment meant to you.</p> <p>Appropriate follow-ups to “Thank you”:</p> <ul> <li>“I really enjoyed it.” “I’m glad it worked out so well.” If you feel uncomfortable just leaving it at “thank you,” try a neutral follow-up statement.</li> <li>“It couldn’t have happened without Jason’s help.” Now, giving a knee-jerk response in which you deny all credit to yourself and transfer it to others is faux modesty. But, when other people really do deserve some credit for the things you’re being praised for, it’s appropriate to mention those folks, <i>after </i>accepting credit for your own role.</li> <li>“I am happy I could help.” This is a good alternative to the “Just doing my job” deflection. Maybe you were just doing your job, but don’t rebuff and deny someone’s desire to show their appreciation for you. Instead, offer a “thank you” and tell them you’re happy you could be of assistance.</li> <li>&#8220;You know, you also played great tonight; nice job!” The boomerang compliment can be appropriate when it&#8217;s truly sincere &#8212; praise you would have given anyway &#8212; and especially when you won&#8217;t see the person again (this is often the case in competition situations). Just be sure to offer your compliment after you’ve fully accepted the one you’ve been given.</li> </ul> <p>If a compliment is particularly heartwarming or special to you, there’s nothing wrong with following up your “thank you” with an amplifier that tells the giver what the compliment means to you, how it makes you feel, or why you value it:</p> <ul> <li>“That really means a lot.”</li> <li>“I really appreciate you noticing that. No one ever has before.”</li> <li>“I was feeling really down and this is just the encouragement I need to keep going.”</li> </ul> <p>Now go forward and offer many more compliments to others and acknowledge and accept the ones that come your way with class!</p> <div class='yarpp-related-rss'> <p>Related posts:<ol> <li><a href='http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/12/15/manvotional-do-it-now/'

—Kipling</p></blockquote> <p>Strength is the glory of manhood. Beauty is not, for beauty is only to be displayed. Culture is not, for culture is chiefly for self-glorification. Fluency is not; a parrot may be fluent. Agreeability is not; a fool may make himself agreeable. Not smoothness, nor plausibility; not softness nor polish, but strength is the glory of manhood. Manhood and strength are synonymous.</p> <p>Where in all the sweep of freaks and failures, of mawkish sentiments and senseless blathery, can there be found an object to excite deeper disgust than one of these thin, vapid, affected, driveling little doodles dressed up in men&#8217;s clothes, but without a thimbleful of brains in his pate or an ounce of manhood in his anatomy? He is worse than weak—he is a weaklet. What can he do? He can squeak with his little voice, strut with his unathletic members and gabble diluted twaddle. He can sigh and pose and outclass the monkey in apish arts. This shitepoke specimen of man tells us that he is tired of life, but of work he can never grow tired, for to that he is a stranger. He affects to look with great disdain on common toil and common people, but the world is grateful that such a specimen of the genus homo is himself uncommon.</p> <p>Many a man has failed in life for no other reason save that he was weak. He had a good heart, but he was weak. He was popular, generous, gentlemanly, but weak. His opportunities were fine, his capital ample, his future inspiring, but he was weak and went to nothing. The ideal Christian has something to him besides syllabub. He must do more than sing Psalms, and testify in the meeting. He is not at his best when the world slaps him in the face, knocks him down, and stamps him. He must be humble, but also strong. He must practice self-denial, but should also possess self-respect. He is taught to forgive his enemies, but also to be angry and sin not. A lovely priest in Paris had incurred the enmity of the sectarians by his liberality. One day a bigot, who was also a bully, met him on the street and dealt him a rousing blow on the cheek. Quietly the lovely priest turned, saying: &#8220;My Master teaches me when thus struck to turn the other cheek also.&#8221; Delivering a still heavier blow on that cheek, the bully said: &#8220;And what does your master tell you now?&#8221; To this the lovely priest replied, as he laid aside his cloak, &#8220;The authorities are divided, but the weight of authority is in favor of the view which I now adopt as I proceed to give you the worst thrashing of your life.&#8221; It is not likely that at the final reckoning, the lovely priest will find much against him for that day&#8217;s work.</p> <p>Strength calls for self-restraint and self-control, but also for self-respect and self-assertion.</p> <p>If one expects to amount to anything in life, he must be strong. Barriers are to be surmounted, discouragements silenced, temptations resisted, and for all this there is needed a manhood invincible and self-reliant, strong.</p> <p>The voice of our highest destiny speaks. It points the way to the summit, achievement of life&#8217;s best ambition. It voices our deepest and constant need. It says: &#8220;Be strong.&#8221;</p> <p>What is strength?</p> <p>It is the absence of excuse-making. &#8220;If I had that fellow&#8217;s chance, if my circumstances were different, if my capital were larger&#8221;—out upon all such unmanly whimpering. The music of strength is not set in the key of whines. We must accept life as it is and make the best of it. Whenever a speaker begins with an apology, you may know his audience is to feed on chaff. Strength strikes the word &#8220;excuse&#8221; from its vocabulary.</p> <blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8216;If I were a man,&#8217; said the restless lad,<br /> &#8216;I&#8217;d never give up and be still and sad.<br /> Were my name but known in the lists of life<br /> I&#8217;d never say &#8220;die&#8221; till I&#8217;d won the strife.<br /> But who will challenge the steel of youth,<br /> Though his heart be brave and his motto &#8220;truth?&#8221;<br /> There&#8217;s work to be done in this life&#8217;s short span,<br /> But alack-a-day! I am not a man.&#8217;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8216;If I were a boy,&#8217; said the toiler gray,<br /> &#8216;I&#8217;d fashion my lot in a better way.<br /> I&#8217;d hope and labor both day and night<br /> And make ambition my beacon light.<br /> I&#8217;d bend the oar, nor drift nor dream<br /> Were my bark but launched upon youth&#8217;s bright stream,<br /> Till I reach the haven of peace and joy—<br /> But, alack-a-day! I am not a boy.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote> <p>Strength never comes down to such sentimental doggerel as this. It may fail, but it will bear defeat with fortitude.</p> <p>Strength is industry. Hard work is only another name for genius. Weakness is often only another name for laziness. It may call itself indisposition, leisure, or some other highsounding platitude, but that doesn&#8217;t change the sluggish inside. A lazy man is a butt of ridicule for all creation. He may have a bank account, but in the world of brawn and brain he is a dummy. The men who have achieved conspicuous success in medicine, law, literature, art, trade, have all been tireless workers. Strength is self-reliance.</p> <p>Henry Ward Beecher used to tell this story of how he was taught when a boy to depend on himself.</p> <blockquote><p>&#8220;I was sent to the blackboard, and went, uncertain, full of whimpering.</p> <p>&#8220;&#8216;That lesson must be learned,&#8217; said my teacher in a quiet tone, but with terrible intensity. All explanations and excuses he trod under foot with utter scornfulness. &#8216;I want that problem; I don&#8217;t want any reason why you haven&#8217;t it,&#8217; he would say.</p> <p>&#8221;I did study two hours.&#8217;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s nothing to me; I want the lesson. You need not study it at all, or you may study it ten hours, just to suit yourself. I want the lesson.&#8217;</p> <p>&#8220;It was tough for a green boy, but it seasoned me. In less than a month, I had the most intense sense of intellectual independence and courage to defend my recitations.</p> <p>&#8220;One day his cold, calm voice fell upon me in the midst of a demonstration, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p> <p>&#8220;I hesitated, and then went back to the beginning; and, on reaching the same point again, &#8216;No!&#8217; uttered in atone of conviction, barred my progress.</p> <p>&#8220;&#8216;The next!&#8217; And I sat down in red confusion.</p> <p>&#8220;He, too, was stopped with &#8216;No!&#8217; but went right on, finished, and, as he sat down, was rewarded with &#8216;Very well.&#8217;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8216;Why,&#8217; whimpered I, &#8216;I recited it just as he did, and you said &#8220;No!&#8217;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you say &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and stick to it? It is not enough to know your lesson; you must know that you know it. You have learned nothing until you are sure. If all the world says &#8220;No,&#8221; your business is to say &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and prove it.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote> <p>One must be sure of himself. He must have self-poise. This is not conceit. Conceit is all wind, and the point of a cambric needle can puncture it to death. Self-reliance is the absence of timidity. It is alertness and forethought. It is preparation and decision.</p> <p>Strength is reliable as well as self-reliant. It may be counted on when the fight waxes hot. One must command the confidence of others as well as his own. The wretched thing about so many who fail is that they cannot be depended on. They are goody-goody, but not reliable. It is a waste of time to dread the disagreeable. It must be faced promptly and duty manfully met.</p> <p>There must be moral as well as physical strength. There must be the courage that stands to its convictions, whatever people may think or say. The hardest mouth to face is not the cannon&#8217;s. It is rather that from whose throat comes the insistent roar of the fickle populace. The majestic strength of royal manhood treats this as an elephant does a fly.</p> <p>There are temptations to be resisted. Nothing short of moral strength suffices for this. Innumerable iniquities solicit tolerance or indulgence, and if yielded to, they will damn here as well as hereafter. A young man came to Nashville a church member and with a clean moral record behind him. He had unusual advantages for success in a noble profession. But he began going to the devil for no other reason than he was weak. His companions were the kind that make the public suspicious, and the people who associate with them impure and dishonest. Two years were enough to bring his prospects in life to zero. He will whine about his poor chances, and the little encouragement given by friends. The truth is he killed his chances with moral cowardice. Strength means moral courage, and ability to stand against ridicule and popular clamor. Strength is not like the willow that bends low to every breeze, but rather like the oak that stands stiff in the tempest, or like the granite cliff against which the mad sea dashes itself to pieces, or like the mountains that lift their calm faces toward the silent stars defiant of all the bluff of storm.</p> <p>This is what it means to be strong, and before such a life the world makes way. Such manhood is in command. The world grows roomy now. In state and church, in public and private life, in work for men and work for God, the call is for men of strength.</p> <p>Strong in purpose and strong in action; strong within and strong without; strong against foes that are seen and strong against foes that are unseen; all the way up and all the way down, all the way around and all the way through; first, last and always—strong! It needs neither title nor crown to argue the imperial majesty of such manhood.</p> <div class='yarpp-related-rss'> <p>Related posts:<ol> <li><a href='http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/08/11/manvotional-the-majesty-of-calmness/' rel='bookmark' title='Manvotional: The Majesty of Calmness'>Manvotional: The Majesty of Calmness</a></li> <li><a href='http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/01/03/manvotional-the-kingship-of-self-control/' rel='bookmark' title='Manvotional: The Kingship of Self-Control'>Manvotional: The Kingship of Self-Control</a></li> <li><a href='http://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/06/28/manvotional-a-nations-strength-by-ralph-waldo-emerson/' rel='bookmark' title='Manvotional: &#8220;A Nation&#8217;s Strength&#8221;

This particular book has also influenced countless individuals in their own lives, helping shape them into better people, but it isn’t a self-help book. It is a book about stories, and storytelling — the stories that drive our societies, and the way we tell them. And because of the commonalities of those stories, it is very much a book about <i>us</i>, and the way we view the world.</p> <p>More importantly, it’s about how we can become better men. The book is about self-actualization at its core and has a replicable approach that applies to every man.</p> <p><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1577315936/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1577315936&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20" target="_blank">The Hero with A Thousand Faces</a>,</i> by Joseph Campbell, is ostensibly about myths and mythology. But the lessons in this book can help us identify and navigate the paths we take to better ourselves and the changes in our lives, in order to become better at change, and better people in general.</p> <p>Campbell, a professor at Sara Lawrence College, studied lore from every conceivable culture; he looked at everything from the ancient religions of antiquity to the mythology of more modern religions like Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.</p> <p>Campbell&#8217;s research led him to focus on <i>comparative mythology; </i>specifically, he looked at what myths from different cultures had in common, rather than what they didn’t. Everywhere Campbell searched, he found it: a single story-telling arc, the ubiquitous story that every culture from Mesopotamia to our modern Western Society uses to pass along information, tradition, and worldly perception. Collectively, Campbell put this information into his seminal and most influential work, <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i>.</p> <p>Borrowing a term of James Joyce, Campbell called this universal pattern <i>the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth" target="_blank">monomyth</a></i>. You might know it as <strong>the Hero’s Journey.</strong></p> <p>It is a single myth, told in a thousand different ways; a single hero, with a thousand different faces. The monomyth is in every story you’ve ever heard, most of the movies you’ve ever seen — and it’s present in your own life, every day. And understanding it can make you a better man.</p> <h3><b>The Hero’s Journey and Why It’s Important</b></h3> <p>The monomyth begins with the main character, or Hero, in one place, and ends with him in another — both physically and emotionally. Campbell asserts that this Hero is the same regardless of the story, and that he appears in different forms. This is important because the hero can be the star quarterback or he can be the accountant in cubicle nine. The paths are different but the journey is the same.</p> <p>Within each journey, the Hero will encounter other characters that play an essential role in growth. Campbell labeled these <i>archetypes (</i>the Herald, the Mentor, the Goddess, the Trickster, etc.)<i>,</i> and they appear in the vast majority of stories. It’s easy to spot an archetype once you know what you’re looking for. So whether the hero is Harry Potter or King Arthur or Frodo, his path is always very similar. Whether the mentor is Dumbledore or Merlin or Gandalf, his role is always to guide the hero.</p> <p>This structure appears everywhere, but is most easily recognized in movies and books. Luke Skywalker starts his journey by leaving his home on Tatooine, having grand adventures, and fulfilling his potential as a Jedi. The events might be different, but the journey is the same one King Arthur takes. And this is the same exact course that prominent figures in religious stories all follow. Campbell shows us just how accurate this concept is, and how it replays over and over again. And it’s happening right now in your life, too.</p> <p>Not yet convinced? Okay, let’s break it down with some examples and let’s take a look at the steps of the Hero’s Journey. While Campbell’s model is 17 stages, for the sake of brevity, I prefer the more abbreviated version used by Christopher Vogler in his book <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193290736X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=193290736X&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20" target="_blank">The Writer’s Journey</a>.</i></p> <div id="attachment_34626" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 459px"><img class="size-full wp-image-34626" alt="vogsmall" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/vogsmall.jpg" width="449" height="353" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Vogler’s model of the Hero’s Journey.</p></div> <p style="text-align: left;">Now, looking at that picture, as well as chart below, you’ll probably get a good idea of what each stage signifies based on the name;

it’s that the commonalities in storytelling exist because they are a fundamental part of the human experience. The monomyth isn’t <i>only</i> the structure of how we tell the undertakings of heroes and characters in stories, it’s also how we relate those stories to ourselves, and, in a very real way, how we understand the things that are happening to us.</p> <p>I would take it a step further.</p> <p>I believe that while the monomyth is exceptional for storytelling, and therefore exceptional for exploring cultural ideas, it can have just as great an impact when applied to an individual — when applied to <i>you</i>. <b>Put somewhat more directly, the Hero’s Journey is the perfect lens through which to view <i>any</i> change in your life — whatever new journey you’re taking, you will go through all of the phases of the monomyth as you grow, adapt, and ultimately fulfill your goal.</b></p> <p>Of course, I’m not the only one who suggests this. For years, the Campbellian model has been used by people in various fields to help people advance; for example, some therapists use it with their patients to help structure psychoanalysis. Similarly, it’s used to help people deal with the grieving process — after all, the 5 stages are grief each have their mirror in the monomyth. Still others use it for mindset or success coaching — helping people understand where they are in the journey not only provides a sense of comfort and control, but also a clear path, making it easier, conceptually, to get to the next phase.</p> <p>Because all changes in your life can fit into this structure, whether you realize it or not, at any given time you’re going through at least one such journey — and mastering the ideology of the monomyth will make you more successful. Because not only is the Hero’s Journey a lens for viewing change, but it’s also an excellent operating thesis for propelling change forward.</p> <h3><b>Practical Application – the Journey of a Gym Rat</b></h3> <p>My exposure to Joseph Campbell and to the gym came at roughly the same period of time in my life. I was a sophomore in college and in need of massive changes to my mind and body. I was 25 pounds overweight, clinically depressed, and generally just unhappy. An inauspicious beginning to my tale, but true nonetheless. That year, I was assigned to read <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i> in a class on Utopian/Dystopian literature. Within the first 30 pages, I was hooked.</p> <p>At that point, I certainly didn’t think I’d found a problem-solving methodology, but being a guy who was heavily into medieval fantasy and mythology, Campbell spoke to me as a storyteller. Reading <i>Hero</i> was immediately beneficial: it made all the books I was already reading even more accessible, and enjoyable. (And believe me, at 19, it was hard to imagine anything that could make re-reading <em>T</em><i>he Lord of the Rings </i>for the eighth time even more enjoyable — <i>Hero</i> did.)</p> <p>Around this same time, I entered a gym, underwent a massive physical transformation, and changed my life in a number of ways. Not only did I build an impressive physique that opened a number of professional doors from fitness modeling and personal training to writing, but I also learned a variety of lessons that have carried over to every aspect of my life, and became successful in ways I couldn’t have imagined.</p> <p>It might seem a little silly to think that getting fit helped me do better in school and have better relationships, and sillier still that it eventually allowed me to start my own business, live life on my terms, and even write a book. But it’s all true.</p> <p>Perhaps more importantly, my transformation, and the lead up to it, was a step-by-step retracing of the Hero’s Journey. As I said, all changes can fit into this model. Let’s take a look at mine.</p> <p><b>The Ordinary World</b> – I was fat and depressed, but didn’t know much else. Like Harry Potter under the stairs or Frodo in the Shire, my Ordinary World was my everyday life.</p> <p><b>The Call to Adventure </b>– In my case, it was an actual phone call. At this point in my life, I was working in a retail store (Gap, of all places), and a woman called asking me to have 30 white polo shirts ready for her when she walked in. Long story short, it turned out her husband was opening a gym about 5 minutes from my house. At the moment, I wanted to make a change. Now, “I need 30 white polo shirts,” isn’t quite as dramatic as “Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi; you&#8217;re my only hope,&#8221; but it got the job done.</p> <p><b>Refusal of the Call</b> &#8211; Change is hard. Sometimes the Hero is more afraid of change than they are of continuing to be unhappy in their situation, or body. The majority of the people who want to embark on a fitness journey (or any journey, for that matter) never get past this point; they think it will be too hard, or that they <i>can&#8217;t</i> change. Or, they start and simply give up. In my case, although I was interested in changing, I was nervous, and it took a few days before I mustered up the resolve to go check out the gym.</p> <p><b>Meeting with the Mentor </b>- Heroes can&#8217;t do everything on their own; we all need mentors. When I finally walked into the gym, I met the owner, Alvin. He had an encouraging manner and an inspiring physique. I took to him immediately, and let him guide me. When it comes to changing your body, that mentor doesn’t necessarily need to be a person with whom you have direct contact; the role of the mentor can <i>also</i> be filled by a book or even website. The author will help you without ever meeting you.</p> <p><b>Cross the First Threshold</b> &#8211; Threshold crossings happen throughout journeys, and the first is always the most impactful. It&#8217;s what separates the Ordinary World from the Special World. When I first joined the gym and started reading about fitness, it was like Dorothy stepping into Oz; there was so much to take in it was intimidating.</p> <p><b>Tests, Allies, Enemies</b> – As I began on my transformative journey, I quickly realized that there were people who wanted to help, and people who didn’t. Some people will support your fitness goals and avoid tempting you; others will call your goals silly and vain. Every time I went to a party or dinner, I had to deal with the invariable, <i>&#8220;Just have a bit</i>e,&#8221; or, <i>&#8220;Just one drink.&#8221;</i> These things are tempting, but to make my transformation a reality, I had to pass these tests.</p> <p><b>Approach</b> – As I prepared for the final showdown — the real meat of the transformation — I had to arm myself to go through it. There were a lot of small events during this time &#8212; cleaning out your fridge and throwing all the junk away, restocking with healthy food, mastering proper exercise form, and learning about nutrition.</p> <p><b>Central Ordeal</b> &#8211; The Ordeal is about the act of change, and the necessity for it. As it applied to changing my body, this was the actual transformation program — that 16-week period where I focused ardently and made it my goal to bend my body to my will. Metaphorically, the Ordeal is about the war between the light and dark halves of your psyche, and your attempt to balance them.</p> <p><b>Apotheosis/Resurrection</b> – Anyone who has gone through a major transformation understands that the results of the Ordeal are pretty intense. In almost all cases, you achieve a sense of heightened awareness &#8212; not necessarily supreme enlightenment, but, at the very least, an unveiling of a world or experience previously hidden from your eyes. In my case, this was the realization that being fit <i>was </i>possible for me, and that all of the benefits of being in this &#8220;club&#8221; were mine. As a storytelling device, apotheosis is about becoming godlike, at least for a moment; in most cases, this only occurs when the character sets aside all resistance and fully gives in to the experience. In that moment, you will not be a god, but you will be like a phoenix &#8212; your new, better self rising from the ashes of the old one you&#8217;ve left behind.</p> <p><b>Seizing the Sword</b>/<b>Reward</b> &#8211; This is what you get after the battle &#8212; something for you. It&#8217;s when the heroes gather together and say, &#8220;W<i>ow, look what we&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</i> It may be a celebration, or a love scene. For me, it was an increase in self-esteem and health that accompanied my new body. Much more than that was the belief in myself that I could manifest change; I’d done this thing which I previously thought impossible, which instilled in me an unshakeable belief that I could do just about anything.</p> <p><b>The Road Back</b> &#8211; After the battle itself is over, the Hero must return home. This is sometimes more difficult than leaving in the first place. The Road Back is emotionally trying, because you fear that you&#8217;ll lose what you gained on the quest. In my case, I had some trepidation that once I was no longer in the throes of focusing on a transformation, I’d revert back to my former self.</p> <p><b>Return with the Elixir</b> – In the best of cases, Rewards are not just for the Hero, but also for everyone around him. Frodo destroying the One Ring brought peace to Middle-Earth; Harry Potter destroying Voldemort did the same for the wizarding world. Well, my transformation sadly didn’t end any wars or save the world, but it <i>did</i> help a lot of people. The act of changing helped me become a better version of myself; many of my better qualities were amplified. I was happier, and made other people happier; I was also more helpful, more dedicated, and (strangely) more punctual. My transformation also inspired others to take journeys of their own. More than anything, the knowledge that I’d gained over the years — starting with when I made my own transformation — allowed me to become a coach and author, helping first hundreds, and eventually thousands of people change their lives.</p> <p><b>Master of Two Worlds</b> &#8211; The last stage of the journey is when the Hero becomes the Master of Two Worlds &#8212; he is able to unite the light and dark within him. Metaphorically, this stage is about balance &#8212; about reconciling who you were with who you have become, and allowing yourself to accept both. For me, it was about mastering life in my new body &#8212; understanding all of the benefits it provided without going overboard in any direction. This was a continuation of the Road Back, and was about slowly moving away from the more extreme stuff and finding a way to live life and do things that normal people do, like go to dinners and have the occasional beer.</p> <p>I should mention that at the time I made my fitness transformation, I didn’t realize that I had been on what could be called a Hero’s Journey — my familiarity with Campbell was fresh, and I wasn’t able to see the parallels quite as clearly. It wasn’t until I began my business (Hero’s) Journey that I understood that Campbell could be applied to anything. From that point on, I began to incorporate some aspects of the monomythic structure into my client&#8217;s programs and my lessons with them; I found that teaching Campbell helps teach fitness information, or at least drive the point home. And it was from this general understanding that I wrote my book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089LOJYU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B0089LOJYU&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20" target="_blank"><i>Man 2.0: Engineering the Alpha</i></a>. And I used that platform — a book that become a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller — to show how to use the Hero’s Journey to get in the best shape of your life.</p> <h3><b>Outside the Gym: Other Examples, and How Campbell Affects You</b></h3> <p>Of course, a fitness journey is just a single example of how the monomyth can be applied to your life. Once you know the general structure, it’s not difficult to plot journeys in all aspects of life — everything from your decision to enroll in college to your romantic relationships.</p> <p>It has exceptional validity with regard to love, actually — just look at the standard plot outline of a romantic comedy: <i>boy meets girls, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back</i>, could just as easily be <em>boy hears the call to adventure, boy refuses call to adventure, boy goes on adventure anyway</em>. In either case, through the assistance of a mentor (could be a wise-cracking friend or parent figure), the Hero will go on a journey of introspection and come out on the other side worthy of the girl.</p> <p>A more detailed example might be that you get married, and settle into married life (Ordinary World). Your wife gets pregnant (Call to Adventure). You freak out at first (Refusal), but are obviously thrilled. Over the course of the pregnancy, appointments with your doctors (Meeting with the Mentor) help you and your wife (Allies) prepare (Approach) for the birth of the child (Threshold Crossing). Being a parent is now your main responsibility (Ordeal) and at the end of the quest there is your child &#8212; your legacy &#8212; who will carry on in the world after you’re gone (Return with Elixir).</p> <p>Want a professional example? How’s this: you lose your job (Call to Adventure), and although you feel its loss and want it back (Refusal of the Call), you eventually decide that you want to move on to a new career. This can go in any number of ways, let’s assume you seek the help of a business coach (Meeting with the Mentor). Eventually, you decide to start your own business, or start a blog — something you’ve never done before (Crossing the First Threshold). There are a lot of challenges along the way, as well as successes and failures (Tests, Allies, Enemies). Follow this path to its ultimate conclusion and you wind up creating something — income, a book, a product — (Reward) that betters you (Apotheosis) and allows you to better the world (Return with the Elixir).</p> <h3><b>Closing the Circle</b></h3> <p>While the strength of the monomyth is certainly due to its universal applicability, perhaps the greatest benefit comes <i>after</i> it’s been applied. <b>As I alluded to above, the act of change itself changes you.</b></p> <p>This principle is what allowed me to take the next step in my own journey and write <i>Engineering the Alpha</i> as a way to make the journey relevant to all men and help them see the path that could guide them to their biggest goals — whether physical, emotional, or social. The result has been a testing ground where thousands of men have been able to transform their lives in ways they never thought possible.</p> <p>And it’s all because of Campbell. Understanding the Hero’s Journey is comparable to the moment when Neo understands the Matrix. It allows you to comprehend what is happening and why, and exactly how you should respond and react to make the best decisions possible. Life slows down, and when that happens you can speed up and make better choices that ultimately lead to change.</p> <p>By going through a massive change, you will come to a greater understanding of yourself, and what you’re capable of. Success is a learned habit, and success begets success — the more positive changes you go through, the less resistant to change and growth you will be.</p> <p>All that’s left is one simple question: Are you ready to become the hero? If so, it’s time to recognize your ordinary world, begin the journey, and ultimately become a better man and the best version of you.</p> <p><em><strong>Where are you in the Hero&#8217;s Journey?

heard about Krav Maga, but I do remember being immediately intrigued. All martial arts have an appeal to most men and their fighting spirit, but Krav Maga&#8217;s draw owes less to the mystique of many of the traditional disciplines and more to a distinct aura of bad-assitude. It&#8217;s a simple and effective &#8220;street fighting&#8221; self-defense system that&#8217;s more martial than art. A well-trained practitioner of Krav Maga is basically a walking human weapon.</p> <p>Wanting to learn more about Krav Maga, I first looked for a reputable gym that taught the system in my area, but I unfortunately came up short. So I got a set of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052T6XLY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B0052T6XLY&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20"><em>Mastering Krav Maga </em></a>DVDs for Christmas last year to familiarize myself with some of its basic principles. Wanting to know still more, I then called up David Kahn, the badass dude who made the videos and the Chief Instructor of the <a href="http://israelikrav.com/" target="_blank">U.S. Israeli Krav Maga Association,</a> to get his insights firsthand.</p> <p>What I discovered is that Krav Maga is a brutally effective tactical mixed martial art/combative and self-defense system that lives up to its reputation. If you too have ever wondered what Krav Maga is all about, here&#8217;s your primer.</p> <h3><strong>The History of Krav Maga</strong></h3> <div id="attachment_34593" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 383px"><img class="size-full wp-image-34593" alt="imi" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/imi.jpg" width="373" height="528" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Imi Lichtenfeld, founder of Krav Maga.</p></div> <p>To fully appreciate Krav Maga, David says, you need to know its history.</p> <p>The origins of Krav Maga can be traced to pre-World War II Czechoslovakia (present-day Slovakia) and a young Jewish athlete named Imi Lichtenfeld. Imi was a nationally and internationally renowned boxer, wrestler, and gymnast. Beginning in the mid-1930s, fascist and anti-Semitic groups rose to power in Czechoslovakia and began inflicting violence on Jewish communities. Feeling duty-bound to protect his neighbors, Lichtenfeld organized a group of young men to patrol his community and defend against would-be attackers. He quickly learned, however, that his training in sport martial arts was no match for the anti-Semitic thugs he encountered. Fighting for points in a match and fighting for your life in a street fight require a different mindset and different techniques. To effectively defend himself and his community, Imi began synthesizing his martial art knowledge and started placing an emphasis on attacks that quickly disabled and neutralized a threat.<br /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34595" alt="imi3" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/imi3.jpg" width="500" height="342" /></p> <p>By 1940, Imi found himself living under a Nazi-allied puppet regime and decided to head for Palestine to join the Zionist Movement and fight for a Jewish state of Israel. When he moved to Palestine in 1942, he joined the <a title="Haganah" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah">Haganah</a>, a pre-Israel Jewish paramilitary organization with a mission to protect Jewish settlers from locals who did not welcome the new arrivals. Israeli military leaders quickly noticed Imi&#8217;s fighting skills and his ability to teach those skills to others. They put him in charge of training the military&#8217;s elite fighting forces, including the Palmach (elite strike force), the Palyam (marine commandos), and the Haganah.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34596" alt="imi4" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/imi4.jpg" width="500" height="379" /></p> <p>After Israel gained statehood in 1948, these separate fighting forces were merged into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), and Lichtenfeld was named the Chief Instructor of Physical Fitness at the IDF School of Combat Fitness. It was in this role that he developed what today is known as Krav Maga. Lichtenfeld needed a combative system he could teach new military recruits in just three weeks &#8212; one that was simple, efficient, and effective, and could be applied in a number of lethal situations. To create such a system, Lichtenfeld combined the most effective techniques of boxing, aikido, judo, wrestling, and jujitsu into a single, fluid, fighting military discipline that emphasized continuous motion, simultaneous defense and attack, and attacks to an assailant&#8217;s soft tissue and pressure points. He called his self-defense system &#8220;Krav Maga,&#8221; meaning &#8220;contact combat&#8221; in Hebrew. It quickly became the official combative of the IDF and continues to be today.</p> <div id="attachment_34598" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><img class="size-full wp-image-34598" alt="imi2" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/imi21.jpg" width="450" height="578" /><p class="wp-caption-text">After retiring from the IDF, Lichtenfeld began teaching Krav Maga to Israeli citizens.</p></div> <p>Imi taught Krav Maga for nearly 20 years in the IDF. After retiring from military service in 1964, he began devoting his time and energy to modifying and teaching the self-defense system to civilians. Imi opened two Krav Maga studios in Israel where he taught thousands of students and instructors, all while continuing to add and improve upon the fighting discipline he had developed in the military. In 1974, Imi founded the Krav Maga Association, a non-profit dedicated to promoting and teaching Krav Maga in Israel and throughout the world.</p> <div id="attachment_34600" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><img class="size-full wp-image-34600" alt="1st-Commando" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/1st-Commando.jpg" width="500" height="333" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Krav Maga is still the official combative system of the Israeli Defense Forces.</p></div> <p>A few of Imi&#8217;s early disciples brought Krav Maga to the United States, and it quickly became a preferred close-combat system in many U.S. military and police forces. Several commercial Krav Maga organizations have formed over the years to teach and promote Krav Maga in the U.S., each with a counterpart in Israel. Each of these organizations claim to be the &#8220;true&#8221; heir and guardian of Imi Lichtenfeld&#8217;s original Israeli Krav Maga, and go out of their way to show their connection to Krav&#8217;s founder.</p> <h3><strong>The Principles of Krav Maga</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="imi-07" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/imi-07.jpg" width="359" height="469" /></p> <p>As mentioned above, Krav Maga is a tactical mixed-martial art/combative and self-defense system that combines boxing, judo, jujitsu, and aikido. In recent years, other martial arts have been incorporated into Krav Maga such as muay Thai and Wing Chun.</p> <p><strong>Neutralize the threat. </strong>The primary goal in Krav Maga is to neutralize your threat as quickly as possible. This overarching goal governs all the other principles of Krav Maga. Because your aim is to dominate and incapacitate your attacker as soon as possible, pretty much anything goes in Krav Maga. You can&#8217;t worry about fighting etiquette when your life is on the line. You do whatever you have to do to preserve your life.</p> <p><strong>Keep it simple. </strong>There aren&#8217;t katas or patterns in Krav Maga. Just strikes, holds, and blocks. Krav Maga was designed so that it could be put to use as soon as possible.</p> <p><strong>Simultaneous defense and attack. </strong>Many martial arts treat defensive and offensive moves as separate and discrete actions, e.g., first you block (defensive), then you kick when you find an opening (offensive). The downside of this approach is that it&#8217;s reactive and you typically just end up in a cycle of never-ending defensive movements. In Krav Maga, the fighter looks to combine an offensive movement with every defensive movement &#8212; he wants to disrupt the attack and simultaneously counterattack. For example, if an attacker goes for your throat, you&#8217;d not only try to deflect his attack, but also simultaneously counterattack by going for his eyes, groin, or throat. The goal is to neutralize your threat as quickly as possible. (Sidenote: Wing Chun also has a similar simultaneous defensive/offensive principle.)</p> <p><strong><em>Retzev</em><em>, </em>or<em> </em>continuous motion. </strong>Related to the principles of simultaneous defense and attack is <em>retzev</em>, a Hebrew word for &#8220;continuous motion.&#8221; David Kahn describes <em>retzev </em>as a &#8220;seamless explosion of violence,&#8221; in which the goal is to neutralize your attacker with a continuous series of aggressive defensive and offensive movements. As your attacker reacts to your counterattacks, you&#8217;ll respond with more punches, kicks, and headbutts until the attacker is no longer a threat. <em>Retzev</em> requires a fighter to work from instinct and not rely on a pre-set routine. A well-trained practitioner of Krav Maga will know how to react to any type of threat without hesitation.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-34599" alt="imi8" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/imi8.jpg" width="512" height="349" /></p> <p><strong>Use of weapons of opportunity. </strong>You can easily incorporate firearms and knives into Krav Maga. Besides these traditional weapons, Krav Maga also teaches practitioners to improvise and use any object at their disposal as a weapon. Keys, pens, belts, and chairs can all be incorporated into Krav Maga techniques in order to neutralize your opponent as quickly as possible.</p> <p><strong>Weapon defense. </strong>Besides teaching students how to use weapons, Krav Maga also shows how to defend yourself from an armed attack.</p> <p><strong>Focus on vulnerable soft tissue and pressure points. </strong>A well-known principle of Krav Maga is its emphasis on attacking vulnerable soft tissue and pressure points. Many counterattacks involve eye gouging, groin attacks, and strikes to the throat. Some criticize Krav Maga for this, arguing that &#8220;it&#8217;s not manly to punch a guy in the nuts.&#8221; I brought this criticism up with David during our conversation and this was his response: &#8220;Krav Maga&#8217;s goal is to neutralize a dangerous attacker as quickly as possible. Plain and simple. Sometimes a strike to the groin is the best option to neutralize an attack. When you&#8217;re violently attacked in the street, the person attacking you isn&#8217;t following some sportsman&#8217;s code of chivalry &#8212; he wants to hurt, maim, or possibly kill you &#8212; so why should you give him the courtesy of not punching below the belt? You can&#8217;t worry about fighting etiquette or what&#8217;s &#8216;manly&#8217; when your life is at stake.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>Subduing techniques. </strong>In addition to striking attacks, Krav Maga also utilizes subduing techniques in order to de-escalate a violent confrontation. Joint locks and various grabs are used to exert control over your attacker and put you in a position to end the threat.</p> <h3><strong>Krav Maga in Action</strong></h3> <p><object width="420" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="//www.youtube.com/v/RCDhfBaIhfw?hl=en_US&#38;version=3" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="420" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="//www.youtube.com/v/RCDhfBaIhfw?hl=en_US&#38;version=3" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p> <p><object width="420" height="315" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="//www.youtube.com/v/nku-zatuZ7E?version=3&#38;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="420" height="315" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="//www.youtube.com/v/nku-zatuZ7E?version=3&#38;hl=en_US" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p> <h3><strong>How to Get Started in Krav Maga</strong></h3> <p><strong>Join a Krav Maga gym. </strong>The best way to get started with Krav Maga is to join a Krav Maga gym. &#8220;Krav Maga, like any martial art, is best learned in a group and under the guidance of a well-trained instructor,&#8221; says David. Because Krav Maga is designed to prepare you for real-life attacks, you need to have people who can help simulate those situations for you in a gym. It&#8217;s hard to practice how to defend and counterattack a headlock if no one is there to put you in a headlock.</p> <p>David did have one caveat about joining a Krav Maga gym. Because of Krav&#8217;s growing popularity in the United States, there are a lot martial arts studios saying they teach Krav Maga in order to get new students, even though the instructors sometimes have little or no formal training in the system. &#8220;Do your research and make sure the instructors are legit,&#8221; David says. If the instructor has trained in Israel, that&#8217;s a good sign.</p> <p>As mentioned above, there are several competing Krav Maga organizations that claim to be teaching the &#8220;true&#8221; Krav Maga of Imi Lichtenfeld. It&#8217;s a touchy subject among Krav Maga followers and there have been lawsuits between the groups. David is the Chief Instructor of the U.S. Israeli Krav Maga Association (IKMA), a non-profit formed in 1978 by Imi Lichtenfeld to govern and promote the teaching of Krav Maga. There are <a href="http://israelikrav.com/index.php?option=com_content&#38;view=article&#38;id=47&#38;Itemid=14" target="_blank">gyms across the country that associate with U.S. IKMA</a>. David teaches at the gym in New Jersey. If you&#8217;re in the area, stop by and check it out. David is a super nice guy and you&#8217;ll learn a lot.</p> <p><strong>Buy videos and books. </strong>If you can&#8217;t find a reputable Krav Maga gym in your area, there are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;field-keywords=krav%20maga&#38;index=blended&#38;linkCode=ur2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20" target="_blank">plenty of instructional books and DVDs</a> on the subject. Watching a DVD is definitely no substitute for actually training in a gym, and you shouldn&#8217;t try out moves you&#8217;ve learned solely by video in a street fight, but the DVDs will give a basic overview of Krav Maga and its techniques. I highly recommend David&#8217;s set of DVDs, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052T6XLY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B0052T6XLY&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20"><em>Mastering Krav Maga</em></a>. They&#8217;re very well-done and David does a great job explaining and demonstrating the methods and movements.</p> <p>&#160;</p> <div class='yarpp-related-rss'> <p>Related posts:<ol> <li><a

You and a gal have been out a few times and tonight you’ve invited her over your place for the first time for <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/12/09/take-back-the-kitchen-3-great-meals-to-impress-a-date/">a dinner you’re whipping up yourself</a>.

When you hear her knock, you open the door to your apartment, your date steps inside, and she looks…kind of turned off. What went wrong?! With clear eyes for the first time, you see that your bachelor pad is the culprit. It’s messy, it’s smelly, and it’s uninviting to anyone of the opposite sex.</p> <p>You can have everything go right on a date, only to ruin it with an unpresentable living space. Making a good first impression with what you call home shows your main squeeze that you care, but it also shows what kind of man you are. It will give her a sense of your personality, and also your personal responsibility. Don’t blow the golden opportunity to impress your date the second she crosses the threshold into your place.</p> <p>In researching this article, we got information from the ladies themselves <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1g2ahe/ladies_of_reddit_what_little_things_impress_you/">via Reddit</a> (fair warning, as with anything on Reddit, it can get fairly vulgar) and Facebook about what makes a good first impression.</p> <p>We’ll look at a few general guidelines, and then delve into some room-to-room pointers.</p> <h3><b>Get Rid of the Man-Funk </b></h3> <p>Smell is probably the most cited infraction for men’s bachelor pads. It has the potential to offend the nose as soon as your gal steps into your home. Follow these tips and you’ll be okay in the olfactory realm.</p> <p><b>Start a couple days early.</b> If you know you’re having a lady over to your place in advance, even if it’s just a chance, start right away. If there’s some lingering or deep-seated scent, it won’t go away in the hour before her arrival. Perhaps even bring in an objective party to let you know what/where smells the worst. You’ve been living in it, so you won’t necessarily know.</p> <p><b>Eliminate the most obvious smell offenders.</b> If it’s not some mystery banana peel behind the couch, the smell in your place is likely the result of multiple offenses. Do your dirty laundry (including bed sheets). It doesn’t take long for those sweaty gym clothes to reek. Take out the trash. Those fresh vegetables you chopped two weeks ago have gone rotten. We’ll cover the bathroom more in-depth later, but get an air freshener in there ASAP. Do the dirty dishes and run the disposal in the sink if you have one &#8212; those are two big contributors to smelly spaces that you wouldn’t necessarily think of.</p> <p><b>Go easy on the Axe.</b> Many a well-intentioned man, realizing his place smells funky, will decide to give everything an Axe (or other scent) spray down. Mixing this smell with any other kind of odor is a recipe for disaster. A very light spray after you’ve cleaned is fine, but don’t be tempted to think that a thick coating will cover up the smells of your apartment.</p> <h3><b>Be Clean, Not Sterile </b></h3> <blockquote><p>“All I care about is that it&#8217;s relatively clean, but not <i>sterile</i> looking. I do actually want to be in your apartment &#8212; not a furniture showroom.”</p></blockquote> <p>General cleanliness seemed to be the second biggest offender in a fella’s bachelor pad. A quick look on Reddit will show that ladies have far too often dealt with beer bottles strewn about, unmade beds, used dishes on every surface, etc.</p> <p>Now, hopefully you know what general cleanliness looks like. But if you don’t, bring in a lady-friend of yours to give some pointers on what she’s seeing.</p> <p>A few items to definitely take care of:</p> <ul> <li>Vacuum. No bachelor in the world vacuums his place enough. It really does wonders for how clean a place <i>feels</i>.</li> <li>Mop/dust any wood or tile floors. Even baseboards; apparently this is noticeable and makes a difference.</li> <li>Dust other surfaces &#8212; counters, shelves, wood furniture, etc. Pick up some Pledge and go all around the house. This is an easy job, and contributes greatly to overall cleanliness.</li> <li>Have the dishes done and away. All of them. This was perhaps my biggest offense as a bachelor. I would leave dishes out, all over my place, for days, and on rare occasions, for weeks (in which case it was easier to throw the dish away than try to clean it). Don’t do that.</li> <li>Make the bed. More on this later.</li> <li>Pick up your stuff. Be organized. <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/08/31/a-place-for-everything-and-everything-in-its-place/">Have a place for everything, and have everything in its place.</a></li> <li>It’s okay to have some quirk. The quote at the beginning of this section is a good indicator as to most women’s feeling on cleanliness based on the comments we saw. Not every surface has to be totally sterile, just organized. Have a small stack of books on the side table. Feel free to leave some work papers out on your desk. Most gals want a home to look lived in, not like a showroom.</li> </ul> <p>Hint: This job will be easier if you have <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/08/14/heading-out-on-your-own-day-14-establish-a-simple-cleaning-routine-and-stick-to-it/">a weekly cleaning plan</a> in place.</p> <h3><b>Display Your Personality</b></h3> <blockquote><p>“Have something unique that reveals something about your personality: artwork on the wall, books, a modest set-up for their computer/TV/etc, a musical instrument, and so forth.”</p></blockquote> <p>You can be sure that once a woman enters your abode for the first time, she’ll be looking around for those things that display your hobbies and interests. She’ll take a look at your bookshelf, your DVD collection, the art/photos on your wall, and anything else she can find that shows your personality.</p> <p><b>Get your hands on some </b><a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/04/01/manly-art-18-virile-artists-from-the-past-to-the-present/"><b>manly art</b></a><b> for your walls.</b>  Lose the posters of the babes. That’s for high school boys. Lose the never-ending sports memorabilia. Having a few pieces is fine, but having your pad draped in your team’s colors will be a turn-off. Don’t leave your walls blank, either. That would contribute to that feeling of sterileness mentioned above. Honestly, a trip to your local Goodwill for some cheap, framed art is one of your best bets. Landscapes are always a manly winner.</p> <p><strong>Put up some photos.</strong> In addition to hanging up some manly art, display some photos on your shelves or wall. Pick photos that say something about your life &#8212; you and your family, you in a different country, you at the finish line of a marathon. Pictures are some of the easiest conversation starters &#8212; your date will be sure to look them over and ask you questions about them.</p> <p><b>Don’t hide things.</b> Unless it’s a large photo of yourself above your bed (yes, one woman mentioned that), it’s probably okay to keep your nerdy collection/hobby out. Don’t feel the need to hide yourself. If there is something you enjoy, you’ll want your date to be okay with the things you care about and like to do. One woman mentioned she knew her boyfriend was the one when she got a look at his stash of board games; you never know what’s going to turn someone on. Just don’t go overboard. If you’re questioning whether it’s too much, it probably is.</p> <p><b>Be prepared for some snooping.</b> I don’t mean she’ll look through your closets or drawers. But you can bet that she’ll have a gander at your bookshelf or <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/10/10/let-the-vinyl-spin-my-journey-into-record-collecting/">vinyl collection</a> when you aren’t looking. Heck, maybe even when you are looking. One of the first things I do, almost by instinct, when I’m in a new place is check out their books. Don’t have anything in eyeshot that you’d be embarrassed of. Many ladies mentioned how impressed they were with <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2008/05/14/100-must-read-books-the-essential-mans-library/">a manly collection of books</a>, so if you’re lacking, consider a trip to your used bookstore. It may even inspire you to actually read them!</p> <h3><b>Pets</b></h3> <p>Be aware of pet sensitivities. It’s a good idea to have your pet corralled when a date first comes over, letting the critter out once you&#8217;ve given her the heads up. Ask ahead about pet allergies, and be sure to vacuum your furniture if you have a pet that likes to lounge with you on the couch.</p> <p>Now let’s move on to specific rooms to pay special attention to.</p> <h3><b>Bathroom</b></h3> <blockquote><p>“I asked him why he didn’t have toilet paper and he told me he only pooped at work so he wouldn&#8217;t have to buy any&#8230;I don&#8217;t even&#8230;”</p></blockquote> <p>Don’t be that guy.</p> <p>Of any single room, the bathroom was mentioned as being the biggest offender in the first impression category. There are a lot of very simple considerations that men too often neglect. It often comes down to basic hygiene and common sense, so don’t get caught having not taken care of the following bathroom essentials:</p> <ul> <li>Clean it. This is first and foremost. Wipe down every bathroom surface with a multi-purpose cleaner. Clean the toilet bowl so it’s sparkling white. Keep the vanity tidy.</li> <li>As mentioned in the beginning, keep an air freshener in the loo. (Use one that’s subtly scented – not overpowering.)</li> <li>Have toilet paper. Don’t let your date find an empty roll.</li> <li>Have soap and a dry hand towel. Make sure the soap is fresh, and the hand towel laundered.</li> <li>Have a trash can. This should be obvious. A woman might have a sanitary item she needs to throw away and if there’s no trash can, she’s really in a pickle.</li> <li>Wash your hands. It’s obvious that you lack basic hygiene when you pop out of the bathroom immediately after the toilet flushes.</li> </ul> <h3><b>Kitchen</b></h3> <p>When I was a bachelor, I think I had one plastic cup, a few mismatched bowls, and a couple forks and spoons. I also had a nice collection of Pop Tarts, Chef Boyardee, and cheap coffee. How my then girlfriend married me is beyond me.</p> <p><b>Have, at the very least, the essentials in your cupboards and pantry.</b> Don’t know what the essentials are? <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/08/21/kitchen-basics/">Good thing AoM contributor Matt Moore has already helped us with that</a>.</p> <p><b>Have at least one set of matching dishes.</b> That aren’t plastic.</p> <p><b>Have more than just junk food.</b> When you offer a snack to your date, you don’t want your only options to be Cheetos and instant mac and cheese. Have some fresh fruits and veggies on hand, pita chips and hummus, etc. Anything to class it up a little.</p> <p><b>Offer a variety of beverages.</b> One of the first things you should do when a date comes over is offer her a beverage. If your only options are water and beer, your gal won’t be too happy. Having juice, wine, <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/06/01/5-classic-cocktails-every-man-should-know/">mixed drinks</a>, soda (bonus points for <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2008/06/05/soda-connoisseur/">unique, craft varieties</a>), etc. available conveys your thoughtfulness. As a bonus, you’ll be prepared for guests that drop by at other times as well.</p> <p><b>Keep it clean.</b> This has already been mentioned, but it’s worth mentioning again to keep the kitchen spick and span and smelling nice.</p> <h3><b>Bedroom</b></h3> <p>The bedroom is the most personal of all the rooms in our home. It can also be where we tend to let ourselves go a bit. An unkempt bed and clothes strewn about is a common find in men’s bedrooms. Don’t let that be you. If your most personal space is messy, it’s a good bet that’s closer to the real you than the rest of your place.</p> <p><a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/08/07/how-to-make-a-bed-using-hospital-corners/"><b>Make the bed</b></a>. It’s good habit to do it every morning anyway, but it’s even more important when you’re giving your date a tour of your place. It shows that you care about the details.</p> <p><b>Pick up your clothes</b>. Have the laundry done so you don’t have an overflowing hamper, and have all your clothes folded and put away. Again, this is good practice anyway.</p> <p><b>A bed frame and headboard helps.</b> I never did this as a bachelor, but I found quite a few ladies who ran into fellas with mattresses simply on the floor. This is okay for a short period of time when you just move in, but head to Craigslist and get yourself a bed frame. It won’t be very expensive. If you want to splurge, get a headboard too. Both convey an impression of stability and put-togetherness that the mattress on the floor does not.</p> <p>Many of these guidelines, if you’ll notice, are common sense. They force you to grow up and become an organized, disciplined man. Following these tips is good practice, period. You’ll impress not only a date, but your mom, your friends, and even that door-to-door salesperson (don’t buy a magazine subscription from him though – another lesson learned as a bachelor.)</p> <p><b><i>What tips do you have to make a good impression for a lady coming to your place for the first time?

The article received a ton of comments from folks who wanted to add their own favorite manly smells to the list, and the other day I found myself lost in enjoyment reading over them all again. So many of the additions were so great and evocative and so worthy of mention, and as the first post was one of my all-time favorites, I couldn&#8217;t resist compiling another edition. Enjoy and add your still unmentioned favorites to the comments!</p> <h3><strong>Black Coffee</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34242" alt="coffee" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/06/coffee1.jpg" width="492" height="492" /></p> <p>&#8220;My favorite scent, not just manly scent, but scent-period: the smell of coffee percolating in one of those enamel coffee pots on a campfire on a cool autumn morning, right next to the river. Inhale the good, exhale the bad. Heal.&#8221; -PiperJon</p> <p>&#8220;How about Cowboy Coffee?! Not that BS latte smell of hot milk, but the deep, powerful smell of cowboy coffee made by dumping grounds right into the pot, in deer camp, at 5 am, over a campfire.&#8221; -Wilson</p> <h3><strong>Gasoline, Motor Oil, Grease, and Garage<br /> </strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34420" alt="motor" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/motor.jpg" width="500" height="364" /></p> <p>&#8220;Every time I’m at a gas station, I can smell my father with his hands covered in engine oil and gasoline from splashing the red canister contents onto the funnel. Those red rags smell more like a man than most men do.&#8221; -James</p> <p>&#8220;Gasoline and motor oil, like when you’re pulling a carburetor off a ’68 Plymouth Satellite with a 318cc V-8… mmmm…. and that smell of hydraulic fluid when you bleed the brakes, that’s a great smell.&#8221; -PiperJohn</p> <p>&#8220;I drive an old Triumph Bonneville motorbike and I have to &#8216;tickle&#8217; the carbs before starting it until a little gas comes out. The smell of it on my finger or leather gloves always makes me nostalgic for my dad’s bike on the carport&#8230;&#8221; -Matt</p> <p>&#8220;My dad would smell like that after working on the family cars, my older brothers would smell like that after working on their cars, and my husband smells like that every day, as he is a mechanic. Too much is too much, but just the right amount of grease on his tan forearms, smelling manly…WOW. That is one hell of a manly smell.&#8221; -Alison</p> <p>&#8220;The mixture of gasoline, WD-40, brake parts cleaner, grease, varsol, welding smoke, tires, and perhaps roll-your-own cigarettes in there somewhere.&#8221; -Josh K.</p> <h3><strong>Freshly Churned Dirt</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter" alt="dirt" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/06/dirt.jpg" width="493" height="452" /></p> <p>&#8220;For me… it’s the smell of freshly turned dirt – that earthy, loamy smell reminds me of the large garden we had in the backyard when I was a youngster. We emigrated from Hong Kong when I was a kid, and my father dreamed of having a farm or acreage in Canada. We never did get that farm, but the privilege of working on his *own* land meant spring and fall, my kid brother and I were outside mucking around in the garden with him as he toiled away. To this day, when I turn the dirt in my own garden, the smell of turned soil reminds me of &#8216;real&#8217; work and what life is all about, not the antiseptic feel of my office, pushing electrons and paper around in an endless circle.&#8221; -Ozone</p> <h3><strong>Airplane Cockpit</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34228" alt="cockpit" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/06/cockpit.jpg" width="588" height="472" /></p> <p>&#8220;I can think of two that make me just want to start combing my chest hair. The smell of an old airplane cockpit. I worked B-52s, and the smell of 40 years of sweat, burnt food, tension, and hard work just can’t be beat. I’m sure it’s one of those acquired smells, once you get it, you got it.&#8221; -Josh</p> <p><em>(For the second thing that makes Josh comb his chest hair, see &#8220;old car&#8221; below.)</em></p> <h3><strong>Aqua Velva</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34385" alt="aqua velva man" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/aqua-velva-man.jpg" width="496" height="529" /></p> <p>It&#8217;s one of <a title="6 Forgotten Drugstore Colognes and Aftershaves" href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/01/10/6-forgotten-drugstore-colognes-and-aftershaves/">the best forgotten drugstore colognes and aftershaves</a> and a smell many commenters felt was truly virile. Said Joe, &#8220;Whenever I put some on after shaving, I feel manly and confident!&#8221;</p> <p>Aqua Velva has become a go-to aftershave for me recently. Love how it smells and feels.</p> <h3><strong>Baseball Glove</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34241" alt="glove" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/06/glove1.jpg" width="500" height="363" /></p> <p>&#8220;I remember when I played in Little League there was no smell like putting your glove on your face: leather, dirt, grass, sweat. Baseball is full of great manly smells.&#8221; -Sam</p> <h3><strong> The Interior of an Old Car</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34388" alt="interiorcar" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/interiorcar.jpg" width="496" height="310" /></p> <p>&#8220;Nothing beats getting into an old car (that hasn’t been completely restored from the ground up) and taking a big ol&#8217; whiff and just smelling the years.&#8221; -Josh</p> <h3><strong>Horses</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34425" alt="horse" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/horse.jpg" width="450" height="623" /></p> <p>&#8220;Anything to do with horses…dried manure, saddle leather, wet saddle blankets, even the smell of hay and sweet feed.&#8221; -Kerry</p> <h3><strong>Locker Room</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34255" alt="locker" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/06/locker1.jpg" width="460" height="343" /></p> <p>&#8220;I can’t believe no one mentioned the smell of a change room after a game of rugby. Sweat, grass, blood, and Deep Heat and after the showers, various types of stinkpretty. Just the smell of a change room almost has the power to impregnate any females passing by.&#8221; -Ben</p> <h3><strong>Old Tackle Box</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34256" alt="tackle" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/06/tackle.jpg" width="475" height="317" /></p> <p>&#8220;The smell of the metal on old, worn-out pocket knives mixed with the remains of earthworms on fish hooks just brings me right back to fishing with my grandpa as a young buck.&#8221; -Mark</p> <h3><strong>Construction Site</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34392" alt="construct2" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/construct2.jpg" width="500" height="481" /></p> <p>&#8220;The smell of a rough framed house, before the exterior doors, windows, and roofing are installed.&#8221; -Kerry</p> <p>&#8220;Cutting steel with a torch. Creosote timber. That deep-down earth smell when excavating. Wet concrete. Someone mentioned construction site, but I figured it needed fleshing out!&#8221; -Jim</p> <h3><strong>Bacon</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34257" alt="bacon" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/06/bacon.jpg" width="447" height="456" /></p> <p>Many people couldn&#8217;t believe we left bacon off the original list&#8230;we can&#8217;t believe it either! One of my fondest memories as a kid was spending Thanksgiving at my grandpa&#8217;s ranch in Bosque Farms, NM. Every morning I&#8217;d wake up to the smell of pan fried bacon, pancakes, and black coffee. That&#8217;s what heaven smells like.</p> <h3><strong>Navy Ships</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34427" alt="navy" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/navy.jpg" width="500" height="388" /></p> <p>&#8220;The smell of warship. Having spent a lot of time at sea when I was in the US Navy, when I visit a warship museum such as USS Midway, the first thing I notice is the smell. Kind of a paint, hydraulic fluid, boiler exhaust, salt air mix.&#8221; -Perry</p> <p>&#8220;I’m an old navy guy too and after 35 years I can still remember that smell. Red lead paint, bunker oil, steam, food from the galley, and gunpowder. Add several hundred – or several thousand – tired and often scared people. Put it all in a steel box and seal it up from the sunlight and fresh air. I visited the USS Texas about 15 years ago. She’d been cold iron since the late 1940s but when I went below decks I could still smell the ghost of that smell in the air.&#8221; -Dave</p> <h3><strong>Newsprint</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34393" alt="newsprint" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/newsprint.jpg" width="500" height="420" /></p> <p>&#8220;Another one is the smell of newsprint. My dad would sit on the couch after work (whence by the way, he would come home smelling of machine grease) and read the paper, back in the days when the paper would really leave some color on your hands. I would sit next to him and that newsprint aroma would waft out when he spread the pages wide open. In the winter, he’d light an old kerosene heater just before he settled down to the paper. Talk about being engulfed in manliness.&#8221; -Hawkins</p> <h3><strong>Splitting Firewood</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34402" alt="split2" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/split2.jpg" width="500" height="631" /></p> <p>&#8220;Hand splitting of firewood. You can’t use an electric or gas powered log splitter and get the same effect. From the metallic smell you get stuck in your nose as you use the double action file to restore the edge on your decades-old axe, to the one-of-a-kind aroma released by a length of red oak as it is cleaved in two, right on down to the combined smell of dank bark chips stuck to your sweaty flannel shirt. Much like the lawn mowing smell, I like to pause to enjoy it.&#8221; -Dave</p> <h3><strong>Bay Rum</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34426" alt="bayrum" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/bayrum.jpg" width="351" height="351" /></p> <p>&#8220;Bay Rum shaving soap. The kind you have to whip to a lather with a badger hair brush. It is a clean, woodsy, herbal scent (yes it goes nicely with Old Spice) and women LOVE it.&#8221; -Dave</p> <p>&#8220;Bay Rum. That’s one of the main ingredients in making a barber shop smell manly!&#8221; -Seth</p> <p>The history of bay rum is as manly as it smells. Several centuries ago, sailors in the Caribbean had the idea to mix bay leaves and rum together to create a cologne that helped cover their stench on long voyages. Islanders took this basic recipe and began adding their own olfactory flourishes by mixing in cloves, citrus rind, and cinnamon. Thus was born an incredibly unique and wonderful fragrance that <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">spread to the rest of the world and became popular among men as an aftershave scent and as a staple at classic </span></span>barbershops<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">. These days it&#8217;s having a </span>resurgence<span style="line-height: 19px;"> as men </span>rediscover<span style="line-height: 19px;"> <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2008/01/04/how-to-shave-like-your-grandpa/">the ritual of wet shaving</a>. </span></span></p> <h3><strong>Canvas Tents</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34399" alt="canvas" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/canvas.jpg" width="500" height="349" /></p> <p>The distinct smell of canvas tents &#8212; a mixture of the scent of the fabric and a mildewy musk &#8212; was indelible for several commenters, whether associated with camping or life in the Army. This smell reminds me of Boy Scout camp in Colorado.</p> <h3><strong>Burning Leaves</strong></h3> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34397" alt="raking2" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/raking2.jpg" width="500" height="545" /></p> <p>&#8220;Here’s a smell that’s hardly ever smelt these days. Probably because it’s illegal, but I loved the smell of burning leaves in the Autumn. It’s a shame kids these day won’t get to experience it.&#8221; -Gregg</p> <p>I&#8217;m one of those &#8220;kids&#8221; who have never experienced the smell of burning leaves in the fall. Most cities in the US had banned it by the time I was born in 1982. My parents have told me about autumn leaf burnings. For about a month, all you could smell in most North American neighborhoods was the smell of burning leaves. I imagine it would have smelled like a campfire, magnified by ten. If you want to experience this smell today, just throw some leaves on your campfire the next time you build one.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">________________________</p> <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Two Odes to Manly Smells</strong></h3> <p>There were a couple of comments that listed a myriad of manly smells, and did so in a way that was down right poetic. Enjoy these two evocative odes to manly smells.</p> <p>&#8220;The smell of a long used wood frame, dirt floored garage.<br /> Canvas tents on a warm summer night<br /> Coleman lanterns pushing the darkness back<br /> The differing smells of ammunition being reloaded<br /> A salt marsh, lake, river, pond or stream at dawn<br /> The woods at dusk.<br /> Driftwood burning on the beach<br /> Lava Soap, the bar not that new fangled pump stuff<br /> An old bar, well kept but permeated with the smells of constant patronage<br /> Leather being worked into various items.<br /> The fixative applied to old black and white Polaroid pictures.<br /> An 16 mm movie projector running.<br /> A flash bulb just after it it’s gone off.&#8221;</p> <p>-Tom R.</p> <p>&#8220;Loads of great memories here. Add a few more, some subtle like:<br /> fresh maple syrup in the morning when my dad made pancakes (or the smell of ANYTHING cooking for breakfast after a long night camping);<br /> the whiff of scent of a freshly lit Zippo lighter;<br /> the faint ozone and oil of slot car racing or model railroad engines;<br /> that sweet airplane glue or the clear dope you painted on tissue paper covered balsa airplane wings;<br /> and Cox model airplane fuel burning in a micro two-stroke spittin’ and barking in your hands.<br /> The sulphur of model rocket engines when they launch;<br /> the fresh pigskin smell of a brand new football.<br /> The grassy plastic smell of “Jarts” on a summer afternoon before do-gooders made them illegal.<br /> And a few not so subtle:<br /> August-hot creosote on the fresh telephone poles my dad would climb when he was a lineman;<br /> the smell of engine, black grease, dust and the acres and acres of crop you were working under your grampa’s tractor when he trusted you to do the field when you were just 11 years old;<br /> black powder smoke from the shooter’s point of view on a firing line of muskets in a Civil War reenactment;<br /> ether engine starter spray;<br /> waterproofing on G.I. tent halves;<br /> mothproofing stuff on canvas webgear and new uniforms;<br /> LSA cleaning solvent for your M-16 or M-60 (and the sulfur, burning grass, and white-hot metal smell whenever you had to change barrels);<br /> deuce-and-a-half diesel exhaust; the smell of the inside of your combat helmet (the steel pot kind);<br /> jet exhaust, dust and just a hint of somebody else’s barf as you exit the tail of a C-130 over a blistering hot tarmac – weird as it might sound, still striking good manly memory smells.&#8221;</p> <p>-B.S.

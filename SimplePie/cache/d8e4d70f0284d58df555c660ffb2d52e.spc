You’re creating a fundamental tool &#8212; one of the first tools ever made &#8212; and every time you pick it up, you’ll think, “Wow, I made this with my own hands.” And because you’re making the knife, you’ll be able to adjust its shape to fit your specific needs. The trickiest part of making a knife is the blade. <a title="Working Iron: A Primer on Blacksmithing" href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2011/07/14/blacksmithing-primer/">If you have a forge handy</a>, and can get your hands on some good tool steel, that’s great. If you don’t, you can still make a knife using an old Appalachian trick: recycling. That’s what we’ll do in this project.</p> <p>Old saw blades are almost always made from high quality steel. You can find them in abundance at swap meets, garage sales, rummage sales, etc. The biggest advantage of using an old saw is the lack of metallurgy you need to do. The blade is already the right hardness for holding an edge, so you don’t need to treat the steel to make it a good knife. However, blanks cut from the saw are sometimes a little too flexible, but you can work around (or with) it.</p> <p>The steel in this handmade knife will not be super-hard. This is not ideal because your knife will lose its edge quickly if you try to hack through wood, slice cardboard, or use it as a screwdriver. But, the good thing about softer steel is that you can bring it back to a razor-sharp edge <a title="How To Sharpen a Pocket Knife" href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/03/05/how-to-sharpen-a-pocket-knife/">with a few strokes of a sharpening stone</a>. I actually prefer softer steel as I like a keen edge, and I carry a small sharpening stone with me. If you can shave your arm hair, your knife is sharp enough.</p> <p>A knife can take many different forms and styles. In this project, we’re going to make what’s called a full-tang knife, meaning that the blade extends its full length into the handgrip of the knife. A partial tang extends only partially into the handle. A full-tang knife is, in my opinion, the easiest way to start making knives. It also produces a solid, sturdy knife that is less likely to break off at the handle.<br /> <img class=" wp-image-34770 aligncenter" alt="full-tang-knife" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/full-tang-knife.gif" width="488" height="342" /></p> <p>Be nice to your knife and it will serve you well.</p> <h3><strong>Materials List</strong></h3> <ul> <li>Old saw blade</li> <li>Thin cardboard manila file folder</li> <li>Pencil</li> <li>Scissors</li> <li>Chalk or soapstone</li> <li>Cold chisel</li> <li>Hammer to drive the chisel</li> <li>Sturdy piece of metal plate to use under your work</li> <li>Metal files (coarse and fine)</li> <li>Wire brush</li> <li>Coarse (00) steel wool</li> <li>Light oil (3-in-1 or gun oil)</li> <li>Acetone</li> <li>Cloth rags</li> <li>Vise</li> <li>C-clamps</li> <li>Hardwood (oak, maple, cherry, etc.) for handle scales</li> <li>Handsaw (Japanese pull saw preferred) if you&#8217;re cutting your own scales</li> <li>Two-part Epoxy (slow-cure)</li> <li>3/16&#8243; brass rod</li> <li>Power drill</li> <li>3/16” sharp metal drill bit</li> <li>Ball-pein hammer</li> <li>Duct tape</li> <li>4-in-hand or a patternmaker’s rasp</li> <li>Sandpaper (80 and 150-grit)</li> <li>Cabinet scraper (optional)</li> <li>Sharpening system of some sort</li> <li>Ear plugs or hearing protection earmuffs</li> </ul> <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to Make the Knife</strong></span></h3> <h3><strong>Step 1: Prepare your pattern.</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-34556 aligncenter" alt="Step 1: Prepare your pattern. Your knife; your pattern! You can use an existing knife and trace it onto the cardboard, or you can design your own. In this case, I’m designing my own shape based on an old knife used by folks from the fur trade. Use a French curve to make sure your curves are consistent and more importantly, pretty. It’s a universal truth that a pretty shape in a tool or knife is a good shape.

Use a French curve to make sure your curves are consistent and more importantly, pretty. It’s a universal truth that a pretty shape in a tool or knife is a good shape. When you get to the point that you’re happy with your shape, cut it out with a pair of scissors. In my knife design, I didn&#8217;t include a bolster or fingerguard like in the illustration above.</p> <h3><strong>Step 2: Transfer the design to your metal stock.</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-34560 aligncenter" alt="Step 2: Transfer the design to your metal stock. Using a piece of chalk or soapstone, trace your pattern onto the old saw blade. It doesn’t have to be perfect, as you will be using your eyes as you go, and you will be filing away any imperfections.

Before you start this step, put on your hearing protection and place a large piece of metal plate under your metal stock.

Something’s gotta give, and you really don’t want that something to break off the chisel and imbed itself in your body somewhere.

Something’s gotta give, and you really don’t want that something to break off the chisel and imbed itself in your body somewhere.</p> <p>Line up your chisel with your chalk line, take a deep breath and give it a good whack. It may not cut all the way through the blade, but the score it makes will suffice for now. Overlap the chisel marks as you work around the outline so there is one solid line, not a series of dashes. Take your time.</p> <h3><strong>Step 4: Bust out the blade.</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-34565 aligncenter" alt="Step 4: Bust out the blade. Creating a sheer is what breaks the metal. I do this by placing the metal over the edge of an anvil and striking it with a hammer as close the scored line and the anvil as I can. If you don’t have an anvil, put your saw blade in a vise and tap the blade as close to the cut line as you can. If you did the chisel work well your knife blade should pop right out of the metal.

For this step, it’s important to remember that sheet metal is resonant (that’s why people play hand saws with a violin bow). The sound of filing a piece of sheet metal is one of true torture. Minimize this by clamping the blade as close the vise as you can and be sure to wear your hearing protection.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><em>Note</em>: Do not attempt to put an edge on your knife yet. The edge should be perpendicular to the sides of the blade. Look for a consistent stripe the width of the blade. That tells you you’re ready for the next step.</p> <h3><strong>Step 6: Start the handle.</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-34482 aligncenter" alt="Step 6: Start the handle. We’re making a full-tang knife, which means the blade edge will be visible all the way around the handle. We’ll do this by adding a scale of wood to each side of the handle. (A scale is a flat piece of wood, bone, or some other material that will create the handle.) You can purchase pre-made scales or make your own. In this instance I’m making my own scales out of a few slats of oak trim I had laying around. Trace the outline of your blade on to your wood stock two times to create the shape of two scales. Then cut them out.

Clean the handle portion of your blank with steel wool and a little light oil (gun oil or 3-in-1 works great).

You can get an idea of what the metal looks like from this image.

You can get an idea of what the metal looks like from this image. Remember, no oils left or your scales won&#8217;t bond to the blank. You can do as much or as little as you want with this step. If you want your knife to have a more rustic look, use a little oil and steel wool (00, or double-aught, which means double zero). Steel wool comes in 00, 000, and 0000. The quadruple aught is used for fine polishing such as removing rust from a gun barrel. The 00 is fine for a knife, unless you’re really meticulous. I prefer to leave a little color in this type of rustic knife.</p> <h3><strong>Step 8: Set up for your rivets.</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-34489 aligncenter" alt="Step 8: Set up for your rivets. Rivets are attractive and will strengthen your knife. Do it right and you wouldn't need epoxy, but I like belts and suspenders." src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/DSC_6241.jpg" width="500" height="329" /></p> <p>Rivets are attractive and will strengthen your knife. Do it right and you wouldn&#8217;t need epoxy, but I like belts and suspenders.</p> <p>You will end up with three rivets through your knife blade. Start by drilling a hole through the tang, and line up one of your scales with the handle and drill through the scale. Make sure you are backing your scale with a piece of scrap plywood so it doesn&#8217;t split out when you drill through. Insert the rod through the tang and through the scale, plus 1/8&#8243; as shown above. That&#8217;s where you want to end up eventually.</p> <p>Put your second scale against the blade, add about 1/8&#8243;, and mark it with a pencil. You&#8217;ll use this later.</p> <p>Do this two more times, and you should have one scale with holes, a blade with holes, and one scale without holes. Pull the rod from the holes if it&#8217;s still there, and use the blade as a template to mark the holes on the scale without holes. Make sure you&#8217;re drilling into the backside of the scale with the scale oriented properly (point end toward the point).</p> <p>Now reinsert the rod into the first hole on the outside of the first scale, through the handle, and through the backside of the scale you just drilled. It should be tight with your 1/4&#8243; marking still 1/4&#8243; from the surface of the scale. If it&#8217;s right, great; cut it off with a hacksaw and insert the rod in the next hole. If make take a bit of fussing to get it right, and if you need to drill a little to make things line up, go for it. Just try to keep the wood holes round. Once that one is in, go to the next hole closest to the blade, and repeat the process. Now separate the scales from the blade, leaving the rods in. A screwdriver or a knife can help.</p> <h3><strong>Step 9: Attach your scales to your knife.</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-34498 aligncenter" alt="Step 9: Attach your scales to your knife. Mix a little two-part epoxy, about the size of a half-dollar, and spread it on one side of the knife blank. (Do not use five-minute epoxy. It’s weak and doesn’t give you time to work.) Place a scale on the epoxy. Repeat this process on the other side of the blade. Now slide your scales back on the knife blade and tap into place. You might have to use an open vise to allow you to tap the scales into place, but they should go on fairly easily." src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/DSC_6251.jpg" width="500" height="329" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;">Mix a little two-part epoxy, about the size of a half-dollar, and spread it on one side of the knife blank.

This is called squeeze-out and is a sign that you have a good bond. Once it oozes, stop clamping. You want a little epoxy in the space. Note that there's a LOT more rod sticking out than 1/8&#34;. That's because I didn't know how much I would need for a rivet, so there's more like 1/4&#34; or more on each side." src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/DSC_6259.jpg" width="500" height="329" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;">After both scales are attached and you’re confident the scales are in the right place, put a clamp or two on the scales and tighten until you see a little epoxy bead form along the edge between the scale and the knife blank. This is called squeeze-out and is a sign that you have a good bond. Once it oozes, stop clamping. You want a little epoxy in the space.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Note that there&#8217;s a LOT more rod sticking out than 1/8&#8243;. That&#8217;s because I didn&#8217;t know how much I would need for a rivet, so there&#8217;s more like 1/4&#8243; or more on each side.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-34511 aligncenter" alt="I dealt with the excess rod by filing it off. It's soft so it didn't take much." src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/DSC_6268.jpg" width="500" height="329" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;">I dealt with the excess rod by filing it off. It&#8217;s soft so it didn&#8217;t take much. Of course, you were smarter than me and benefited from my experience. You won&#8217;t have to do this.</p> <h3><strong>Step 10: Pein your rivets.</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-34513 aligncenter" alt="Step 9: Pein your rivets" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/DSC_6270.jpg" width="500" height="329" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;">The worst part about building things by yourself is that sometimes you can&#8217;t take pictures of a particular step. So I will be as descriptive as possible. Place your knife on a hard surface such as a metal plate or an anvil if you&#8217;re lucky enough to have one or know someone that does. Using the round side of a ball pein hammer (it&#8217;s called a pein for a reason), tap your brass rod, moving the hits in a slight circular motion, not hitting the rod straight in the middle. This allows the metal to mushroom a little bit. Pein your rivet for a few minutes, turn your knife over and repeat. If the rods don&#8217;t appear to be equal on each side, tap the rod so it sticks out a little more on the other side.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Continue to tap, turning the knife often as the rods (now rivets) approach the handle. As the rivet touches the scales, tap a little harder and recess (slightly) the rivets. Keep going and do the other two.</p> <h3><strong>Step 11: Shape and sand the handle. </strong></h3> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-34517 aligncenter" alt="Step 10: Shape the handle. Clamp the handle in a vise and begin shaping your handle. There’s no set way to do this, but I find a 4-in-hand or patternmaker’s rasp works great. Take it easy, running the file mostly up and down at a 45 degree angle to the blade. Work slowly. If you get to close to the blade with your rasp you can dull the rasp." src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/DSC_6275.jpg" width="500" height="329" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;">Clamp the handle in a vise and begin shaping your handle. There’s no set way to do this, but I find a 4-in-hand or patternmaker’s rasp works great. Take it easy, running the file mostly up and down at a 45 degree angle to the blade. Work slowly. If you get to close to the blade with your rasp you can dull the rasp.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">As you continue to shape with your rasp, check the handle frequently to make sure it is symmetrical and fits your hand nicely. Go slow; it’s easier to take off than put back.</p> <p>When your handle is the shape you want, sand it with a heavier grit sandpaper (80 or so), then gradually use finer and finer grits until the handle is a smooth as you want it to be. Go ahead and sand your rivet heads to flatten them a little too. The metal is soft and the sandpaper will cut the metal just fine.</p> <p>When sanding wood, you can tell you’re ready for the next finer grit when you can see no sanding marks from the previous grit. In other words, when you go to a 120 or 150-grit from an 80-grit, you should see no sanding marks that are from the 80-grit. If you move to finer grit too quickly, you’ll have more work to do when you step down for the next sanding.</p> <h3><strong>Step 12: Finish your handle.</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-34526 aligncenter" alt="I like oiled finishes, so I used a hempseed oil to finish the handle. You can use whatever suits your fancy." src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/DSC_6285.jpg" width="500" height="329" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;">I like oiled finishes, so I used a hempseed oil to finish the handle. You can use whatever suits your fancy. The more coats of oil, the richer the look and you&#8217;ll be providing a lot of protection to your wood.</p> <h3><strong>Step 13: Sharpen your blade.</strong></h3> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-34538 aligncenter" alt="Wrap cardboard or leather around your finely sanded handle and secure with duct tape. Clamp the knife handle in your vise with the edge to be sharpened facing up. Put on your hearing protection. Using a file, start filing up and down the blade edges, holding the file at an approximately 20–22 degree angle to the blade. Visualize this distance by cutting a 45-degree angle in half. Do not drag the file, as it only cuts on the pushing stroke. Don’t file in one spot too much or you’ll create a low spot, which means a do-over if you want a good, true edge." src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/DSC_6361.jpg" width="500" height="329" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;">Wrap cardboard or leather around your finely sanded handle and secure with duct tape. Clamp the knife handle in your vise with the edge to be sharpened facing up. Put on your safety glasses and hearing protection. Using a file, start filing up and down the blade edges, holding the file at an approximately 20–22 degree angle to the blade. Visualize this distance by cutting a 45-degree angle in half. Do not drag the file, as it only cuts on the pushing stroke. Don’t file in one spot too much or you’ll create a low spot, which means a do-over if you want a good, true edge.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-34545 aligncenter" alt="Do a few strokes on one side, then on the other. You’ll see your nice flat edge disappear as you remove metal. Watching this edge is a good indicator of how even your filing is. Most people (myself included) tend to screw up the tip by either not filing it enough, or letting the angle drift toward 25…28…30… Be careful and go slow. Stop when you have a filed edge that looks clean and straight. " src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/DSC_6368.jpg" width="500" height="329" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;">Do a few strokes on one side, then on the other.

Stop when you have a filed edge that looks clean and straight.</p> <p>If you do mess this up, file the blade flat like you did in Step 5 and start over. Depending on the size of the blade, the tip may vibrate. Clamping a small C-clamp with a piece of scrap wood on the back of the blade can lessen vibrations (and keep your dogs, cats, and other creatures within earshot from howling at the sound).</p> <p><strong>Step 14: Hone the blade.</strong> <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/03/05/how-to-sharpen-a-pocket-knife/" target="_blank">You can use any sort of sharpening method</a>: Diamond stones, Arkansas stones, Japanese wet stones, ceramic sticks; it doesn’t matter. You’re just refining the edge. When you’re done, cut something (preferably not yourself) to test the blade.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/DSC_6344.jpg"><img alt="DSC_6344" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/DSC_6344.jpg" width="500" height="330" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You’ll want to make a sheath like this for the knife, of course.

Kate and I used to have times where we spent nearly an entire day going through and processing email instead of researching and writing content for our fantastic readers. We hated those all-day email-fests. At the end, we&#8217;d feel a bit of relief that we had cleared our inboxes, but simultaneously feel anxiety that we didn&#8217;t get to what&#8217;s important to us and the site. Even if we had some time to actually get to writing, <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/01/08/willpower-part-ii/">our willpower was so drained</a> from having to make so many choices about how to respond that we just didn&#8217;t have the mental energy or focus to effectively shift to a different task.</p> <p>We&#8217;re not alone in feeling both drained and chained to our inbox. According to the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/16/business/la-fi-tech-savvy-emails-20120816" target="_blank"><i>L.A. Times</i></a>, recent studies have found that the average employee spends up to a third of their day answering email instead of doing productive work. The time-suck created by email has forced some companies to create draconian no-email policies to force their employees into actually being productive.</p> <p>When email was created, it was meant to streamline our communication and make it more efficient. And it still can, but more often than not it morphs into a time-devouring, stress-inducing, legacy-work destroying monster. How can we vanquish the mighty beast that lurks in our inboxes and let peace once more reign throughout the land?</p> <p>While I admittedly haven&#8217;t gotten a complete handle on managing my email effectively, I&#8217;ve made huge strides over the years. Answering emails now constitutes a far, far smaller percentage of my day than it used to. Below I share what I&#8217;ve learned on minimizing the amount of email I receive and how to process it quickly and effectively. I highly encourage you to implement many of these steps as soon as you read them; it’s so easy to put off taking action in this area and then never get to it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auXMHMAZL6Y"><b>Do it now!</b></a><b></b></p> <h3><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Reduce Email Coming In</span></b></h3> <p>The first step to take in conquering your email is reducing the number of emails arriving in your inbox. Here’s how.</p> <p><b>Turn off notifications from social media sites. </b>You don&#8217;t need to get emails every time someone responds to a tweet or Facebook comment or when someone connects with you on LinkedIn. You&#8217;ll see those updates when you actually visit those sites anyway, so why have them gunk up your inbox? Moreover, those notifications are just distractions waiting to happen. (&#8220;Ooo&#8230; someone posted a comment on my Facebook photo. Let me check that out&#8230;.&#8221; *spends another 20 minutes surfing Facebook.*) Visit the account settings pages on all the social media sites you belong to and turn off ALL email notifications.</p> <p><b>Mass unsubscribe from bacn.</b> Most email providers do a decent job of preventing spam from hitting your inbox. But what can you do about those newsletters and coupon deals you yourself have signed up for over the years? Pronounced “bacon” (it’s a techie term – it’s “better than spam, but not quite as good as a personal message”), these are emails that you’ve subscribed to, but you never open them, they clutter up your inbox, and they’re annoying. Technically, it’s not spam email because you’ve given permission (even if you didn’t realize it at the time). Sometimes bacn is useful &#8212; like The Art of Manliness newsletter! &#8212; but usually it’s a nuisance.</p> <p>Get a handle on your bacn by unsubscribing from lists you no longer wish to be on. The hard and long way to do this is to open each unwanted message one by one as they come in and click the &#8220;unsubscribe&#8221; option within. A more efficient way would be to use one of the many mass unsubscribe tools out there on the market.</p> <p><a href="https://unroll.me/" target="_blank">Unroll.me</a> is what I use. Connect your Gmail or Yahoo email to Unroll.me, and the site goes through your inbox to find subscription emails. Unroll.me will then present you a list of email addresses that look to be subscriptions and ask you if you want to unsubscribe or &#8220;add to Rollup.&#8221; Click unsubscribe and you&#8217;ll no longer get that email. If there are some subscription emails you&#8217;d still like to get, you can combine all those into a single email digest (called your Rollup).</p> <p>Unroll.me does a pretty decent job of catching all those subscription emails, but a few still slip through the cracks. Another thing you can do is use your inbox&#8217;s search function and search for &#8220;unsubscribe.&#8221; That should bring up most of the subscription emails you get and then it&#8217;s just a matter of going through them and unsubscribing from the ones you no longer want to receive.</p> <p>To prevent more bacn in the future, it might be a good idea to set up a &#8220;burner email&#8221; that you can give to websites or companies that require an email from you to access their service. <a href="http://maildrop.cc/">MailDrop</a> is an excellent service for creating email addresses for those times you don&#8217;t want to give out your real one.</p> <p><b>Set up filters to stop annoying FWD: emails. </b>We all probably get those annoying FWD: chain emails featuring some political rant or silly urban myth. They&#8217;re usually sent by just a select few people in your contact list &#8212; an aunt or that <a href="http://politix.topix.com/img/1757PHOD6TG90NLT-rszw514">squirrely-looking co-worker</a> in the next cubicle over.</p> <p>Filter these emails to a special folder. Gmail makes creating this filter a breeze. (Other email programs do as well, we’re just highlighting the specific process for Gmail.)</p> <div id="attachment_34755" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><img class="size-full wp-image-34755" alt="Screen Shot 2013-07-16 at 5.21.53 PM" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-16-at-5.21.53-PM.png" width="500" height="169" /><p class="wp-caption-text">When you receive an offending forward from a person, click on &#8220;More&#8221; and then &#8220;Filter messages like these.&#8221;</p></div> <div id="attachment_34756" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><img class="size-full wp-image-34756" alt="Screen Shot 2013-07-16 at 5.22.22 PM" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-16-at-5.22.22-PM.png" width="400" height="266" /><p class="wp-caption-text">In the subject line, add &#8220;fwd or fw.&#8221;</p></div> <div id="attachment_34757" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><img class="size-full wp-image-34757" alt="Screen Shot 2013-07-16 at 5.22.53 PM" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-16-at-5.22.53-PM.png" width="400" height="303" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Click “Continue.” And then check &#8220;Skip Inbox (Archive)&#8221; and apply label &#8220;Forwards.&#8221;</p></div> <p>Now whenever you get a forward from that person, it will go directly to the folder you just created. Review it once a week on the off-chance that one of their forwards might actually be important.</p> <p><b>Write emails that don&#8217;t create more emails. </b>One problem with email is that it often simply begets more email. On average, an outgoing email generates two responses. The Asian Efficiency Blog calls this problem the <a href="http://www.asianefficiency.com/email-management/email-boomerang/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Email Boomerang Effect</span></a>. For example, you send out an email with an open-ended question like:</p> <p>&#8220;When do you want to get together?&#8221;</p> <p>They respond with, &#8220;Monday.&#8221;</p> <p>You: &#8220;Monday isn&#8217;t good for me. How does Tuesday sound?&#8221;</p> <p>Them: &#8220;Sure. What time?&#8221;</p> <p>You: &#8220;2PM?&#8221;</p> <p>Them: &#8220;2PM isn&#8217;t good. How about 5PM?&#8221;</p> <p>And so on.</p> <p>Most of those emails could have been avoided by simply substituting the initial open-ended question for one that elicits a yes/no response like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get together this week. I&#8217;m available M,T,W between 12PM and 5PM. Do any of those dates/times work and if so which one?&#8221; They respond with the date and time. End email thread.</p> <p>Here are some other strategies you can use to write emails that don&#8217;t initiate the Email Boomerang Effect</p> <ul> <li><b>Use CC with discretion. </b>Every person you add to an email thread is just another reply waiting to happen. Avoid needless emails by only including people who absolutely need to be in the thread.</li> <li><b>Try to include a non-response default action. </b>When you write up an email with a question, set up the question so that there&#8217;s a default action that requires no response from your recipient. For example, when you&#8217;re planning an event, you can phrase your email like this: &#8220;I’m going to schedule the conference room for Tuesday at 3PM. If I don&#8217;t hear back from you by tomorrow, I&#8217;ll assume that&#8217;s fine.&#8221; If the person doesn&#8217;t have a problem with it, you won&#8217;t get a response. Boom. You just reduced the amount of email you received.</li> <li><b>Add &#8220;FYI&#8221; at the beginning of the subject line; end with NRN. </b>Many emails you send are just for informational purposes and don’t require a response. Let your recipient know that in the subject line by beginning with &#8220;FYI&#8221; and ending with &#8220;NRN&#8221; (no response needed). Example: &#8220;FYI: Latest company report. NRN.&#8221;</li> <li><b>Don&#8217;t send emails. </b>The simplest solution to the Email Boomerang Effect is to just not send email unless it&#8217;s absolutely necessary. Use this <a href="http://www.onlineitdegree.net/email-overload/" target="_blank">flow chart</a> to help you determine whether you <i>really </i>should send that email.</li> </ul> <p><b>Set up barriers. </b>One of email&#8217;s biggest advantages is also its biggest drawback: there are hardly any barriers in time/effort/embarrassment in sending an email, so people will just blast one off without much thought.</p> <p>Not very long ago, if you wanted to get in touch with a friend, media outlet, or business, you’d have to write a letter or pick up the phone. Just because technology has now made connecting with nearly everyone instantaneous and fairly anonymous, doesn’t mean people have the right to try to connect with you whenever and wherever they want, nor are you required to make yourself available to anyone who asks; an invention may change expectations, but it doesn’t automatically make those expectations reasonable or civilized. Which is to say, technology may have made communication easier, but it hasn’t made your time any less valuable.</p> <p>So if you’re someone who runs their own business and receives lots of unsolicited email, don’t feel bad about putting up barriers to your inbox. Our friend Antonio Centeno at <a href="http://www.realmenrealstyle.com/">Real Men Real Style</a> makes people who use his contact form promise not to ask questions that could be answered with 10 minutes of googling and to do a good deed if he answers their email within 23 hours.</p> <div id="attachment_34758" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><img class="size-full wp-image-34758" alt="2013-07-17_2153" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/2013-07-17_2153.jpg" width="500" height="246" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Antonio&#8217;s contact form. You have to promise not to ask stupid questions before you email him.</p></div> <p>Over a year ago, Kate and I took the even more dramatic step of eliminating our contact form altogether. People can instead get in touch with us by either sending a tweet or writing us a real letter. We did this because, as mentioned at the outset, more and more of our time was consumed in answering email. And 90% of that email was crap: business and PR pitches, grammar corrections, questions that could be answered with a google search, or about whether they had won a giveaway from five years ago. But the real light bulb went off when I read something that talked about how communication should be, and used to be, equitable; when you talk to someone on the phone or swap letters, each person spends about the same amount of time on the exchange. But with email, someone would spend 2 minutes firing off a question that would take me ten minutes to answer. The sender/responder time investment balance was really out of whack.</p> <p>Getting rid of the contact form lifted a huge burden of static, stress, and time-suck from our lives. It was amazing. I’m sure it infuriates a few people who firmly believe they have the right to instantaneous communication, but the few times I’ve heard from them, it turns out they were seeking to convey exactly the kind of pointless message the barrier is there to prevent! We’re very happy to answer all letters that we get. But honestly we don’t get a ton. Interestingly enough, stuff that once seemed important to folks stopped being so important once they had to use some forethought and put in as much time with their query as I do with my response.</p> <p>Obviously, this solution isn’t for everyone. A lot of businesses need to hear from their clients as much as possible. But whatever your situation is, look for your own way to put up a barrier to your inbox so you get more of the emails you want and need and less chaff.</p> <p><b>Pick up the phone, use Skype, go talk to the person face-to-face. </b>If it looks like an email exchange will go past four back-and-forth emails, pick up the phone, use Skype, or go talk to the person face-to-face. It&#8217;s sometimes simply more efficient to spend 5 to 10 minutes discussing what you need than spreading out the same conversation all day on email.</p> <h3><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Process Email Quickly and Efficiently</span></b></h3> <p>So you&#8217;ve reduced the number of emails you&#8217;re getting. That&#8217;s a start. Now we need a system to quickly process the emails left in our inbox. Here are some suggestions.</p> <p><b>Turn off email notifications on your computer and phone. </b>To break the time-sucking habit of constantly checking your email, turn off all email notifications on your computer and phone. Those random little &#8220;pings&#8221; are just conditioning you to check your email compulsively like a Pavlovian dog. Moreover, email notifications distract us from focused, concentrated work. Our brains aren&#8217;t really wired for multi-tasking. We may think we&#8217;re just going to spend only a minute reading that latest email, but studies have found it takes, on average, 25 minutes to return to your original work once you’ve gone down the rabbit hole.</p> <p><b>Establish set times for responding to email. </b>Instead of checking your email as the notifications come up, set aside specific times each day that you dedicate to checking and responding to email, such as a 30-minute session in the morning and at the end of the day. You&#8217;ll be amazed how much email you&#8217;ll be able to process and answer when you&#8217;re solely focused on the task.</p> <p>To make your email sessions even more productive, consider answering emails in &#8220;offline&#8221; mode. Answering emails offline ensures that you don&#8217;t get bogged down in a game of &#8220;email tennis&#8221; where someone responds immediately to your response.</p> <p>A common rebuttal to only checking and responding emails a few times a day is: &#8220;What if I get an important email that needs a response ASAP?&#8221; If it&#8217;s <i>really </i>that important, the person trying to reach out to you will connect to you a different way, like calling you on the phone. The reality is most things in email aren&#8217;t that important and can wait a few hours for a response. Email&#8217;s immediacy just makes us feel that everything we communicate is urgent even though it&#8217;s not.</p> <p>Here are a few other tips when considering the timing of answering emails:</p> <ul> <li>Get out of the habit of checking email first thing in the morning. Instead, spend that time in <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2011/09/05/bookend-your-day-the-power-of-morning-and-evening-routines/">a routine that will set you up for daily and lifetime success</a>.</li> <li>When you do commence your morning email review session, move emails that don’t need an immediate answer to a special folder (see below) and then answer them at the end of the day. <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/01/08/willpower-part-ii/">You only have a limited amount of willpower each day</a>, so don’t waste it on formulating email responses before you even dive into your important work.</li> <li>Don&#8217;t respond to business emails after work hours. You don&#8217;t want clients or fellow employees to get the impression that you&#8217;re available 24/7. Establish boundaries or else you&#8217;ll never leave your inbox. Feel free to write up your replies at night in offline mode, just don&#8217;t send them until the next morning. Of course, if you’re moonlighting on top of your regular day job, answering email during non-work hours is probably your only option.</li> </ul> <p><b>Respond, delete, file, archive. </b>During your email sessions, quickly scan your inbox. With each email, you&#8217;re going to perform one of four actions:<b> respond, delete, file, archive. </b>The goal is to completely clear your inbox.</p> <blockquote style="border: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"><p><b><em>Respond</em>:</b> If responding to an email will take less than two minutes, then reply and be done with it. This can include delegating it to the more appropriate party or to an assistant. If the email doesn&#8217;t require a response, but has an associated action &#8212; like bringing the drinks to your kid&#8217;s next soccer game &#8212; write the action item in your to-do list and archive the email.</p> <p><b><em>Delete</em>: </b>Be judicious with the delete key. I like <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2012/08/05/managing-email-realistically/">Matt Gemmell&#8217;s</a> approach to processing email:</p> <blockquote><p>“The importance of an email isn’t something you need to spend time thinking about. If it doesn’t immediately and obviously make you feel you should reply to it within the next day or two, it’s not that important <i>to you</i>. Archive or delete it.</p> <p>If it’s sufficiently important to <i>someone else</i>, that person will expend effort to make it come back to you. If the email does not come back to you, you would have wasted your time replying to it. Win-win.”</p></blockquote> <p>When in doubt, delete. Don’t feel guilty.</p> <p><b><em>File</em>: </b>If an email will require extra time to answer and isn&#8217;t urgent, file it away to a &#8220;To Answer&#8221; folder. Dedicate your last email-checking session each day to tackling emails in this folder.<b><br /> </b></p> <p><b><em>Archive</em>: </b>If an email is just for informational purposes and doesn&#8217;t require a response or action, archive it. If you need that information, you can always find it using your email’s search feature.</p></blockquote> <p><b>Use the five-sentence rule. </b>Keep responses brief. It saves time for both you and your recipient. Entrepreneur Guy Kawasaki recommends the &#8220;<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226581">five sentence rule</a>&#8221; when writing emails. &#8220;Proper email is a balance between politeness and succinctness,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Less than five sentences is often abrupt and rude, more than five sentences wastes time.&#8221;</p> <p><b>Use canned responses. </b>If you get emails that require the same sort of answer over and over, consider creating a canned response. With just a click, your message will populate and be sent. A quick google search will help you find out how to create a canned response for your specific email client.</p> <p><b>Use text expanders. </b>Related to canned responses, consider getting a text expander. Text expander programs allow you to assign predefined keystrokes to complete words and phrases. Whenever you type that keystroke in, the text expander will type out the complete word or phrase. Typing out full words is for suckers.</p> <p>Here are some text expander programs for the various operating systems out there:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.phraseexpress.com/"><b>PhraseExpress</b></a> (Windows 7)</li> <li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/238306/lifehacker-code-texter-windows?tag=softwaretexter"><b>Texter</b></a> (All other versions of Windows)</li> <li><a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/"><b>TextExpander</b></a> (Mac)</li> <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/autokey/"><b>AutoKey</b></a> (Linux)</li> <li><a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/"><b>AutoHotKey</b></a> (Windows/Mac/Linux)</li> </ul> <p><b>Use vacation responders. </b>To reduce the amount of email that clogs up your inbox while you&#8217;re on vacation, make sure to use a vacation responder. That way people won&#8217;t keep emailing you again and again because they think you&#8217;re around and just not responding.</p> <p><b>Use an email processing tool. </b>If you&#8217;re still having trouble processing your emails, consider using a web app to help you get through them quickly and painlessly. Here are a few to check out.</p> <blockquote style="border: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"><p><a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/186531?hl=en" target="_blank">Gmail Priority Inbox</a><b>.</b> If you use Gmail, give their <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/186531?hl=en">Priority Inbox</a> feature a whirl. When you turn it on, Gmail starts watching how you answer and process your email. Based on your behavior within the inbox, Gmail will start sorting your email automatically for you, putting your important stuff on top and not so important stuff on the bottom. It takes awhile for Priority Inbox to really work its magic, so be patient in the beginning.</p> <p><a href="https://www.sanebox.com/" target="_blank">Sanebox.</a> Sanebox functions similarly to Priority Inbox, but works with multiple email clients.

If you&#8217;re like me, you sometimes have trouble knowing whether to respond, delete, file, or archive. What happens more often than not is I don&#8217;t take any action and just let the email sit in my inbox. The Email Game gives you a nudge by turning answering your email into a game. Just connect your Gmail account to The Email Game and start a new game. The Email Game will go through each email in your inbox and force you to respond, delete, archive, or skip. If you respond, delete, or archive, you earn points; if you skip an email, you lose points. When you decide to respond to an email, The Email Game only gives you three minutes to do so. If you don&#8217;t do it within the time limit, you lose points.</p> <p>I&#8217;ll use The Email Game if I get particularly backlogged on emails. With its help, I can usually blast through all of them in a single session.</p> <p><a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/" target="_blank">Mailbox.</a> Mailbox is an email app for your iPhone and iPad that has received a lot of buzz recently.

The FAQ.</em></a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Whether you’re self-employed, a student, a freelancer, or simply have an office job where your boss lets your roam, working in a coffee shop occasionally can be both enjoyable and beneficial. Changing up your environment can spur your creativity, and our <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/04/working-best-at-coffee-shops/237372/">fear of being out in public alone without a purpose</a> can motivate us to keep busy and stay on task. Plus, if you work at home, you know it can occasionally get a little isolated and lonely – it’s nice to go out and be surrounded by humanity now and again. When I head to a coffee shop to get some work done, here are the kinds of things I like to bring along.</p> <p><strong>1. The Headphones:</strong> <a href="http://en-us.sennheiser.com/over-ear-headphone-momentum-stereo?utm_source=artofmanliness&#38;utm_medium=banner&#38;utm_campaign=momentum">Sennheiser Momentum</a> Headphones. <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2012/02/22/a-creative-buzz/?mod=WSJBlog">Researchers have actually found</a> that a moderate amount of ambient noise – the background sounds of a coffee shop &#8212; can spur more creative thoughts than working in a quiet or very loud environment. It’s what <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/04/working-best-at-coffee-shops/237372/"><em>Atlantic</em> columnist Conor Friedersdorf</a> calls “just enough distraction” – a happy place between onerous interruptions and stultifying silence. But if I’m seated by people having a loud conversation, the noise of a coffee shop quickly goes from just enough to highly distracting – I want to listen to what they’re saying. So I always bring a pair of headphones – the music blocks out the yakking while still letting in some ambient buzz. These Sennheiser Momentum headphones fit the bill nicely and combine old-school style with modern high-tech, high-fidelity performance. They produce a naturally rich and clear sound with expertly rendered mids, and smooth highs.</p> <p><strong>2. The Laptop:</strong> <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/" target="_blank">MacBook Air</a>. I always try to bring my laptop fully charged. Sometimes there isn’t a seat by an outlet, so you’ll need all the reserve juice you can get. The MacBook Air has got some fantastic battery life.</p> <p><strong>3. The Tunes:</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NKYPBE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B003NKYPBE&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20">Les Baxter <i>Space Escapade.</i></a><i> </i>I need music with &#8220;just the right amount of distraction&#8221; while I work. Songs with lyrics throw me off and sometimes classical music is just too heavy. That’s why my go-to soundtrack when I’m working is exotica music. It’s pleasant, light, and reminds you of 1950s suburbia. Les Baxter’s <i>Space Escapade</i> is a good album to start with. It&#8217;s filled with great tunes that will keep you productive during your coffee shop work session.</p> <p><strong>4. The Shoes:</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AMN64A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B000AMN64A&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20">Jack Purcell from Converse.</a> Go with a classic canvas sneaker rather than flip-flops in the summer for a more mature and put-together look.</p> <p><strong>5. The Shorts:</strong> <a href="http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=56794&#38;vid=1&#38;pid=524842002">Flat-front Shorts from Old Navy.</a> An affordable, good-looking pair of khaki shorts.</p> <p><strong>6. The Shirt:</strong> <a href="http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=15084&#38;vid=1&#38;pid=494519022">Linen shirt from Gap</a>. You don’t need to get all gussied up to go down to a coffee shop, but you shouldn’t schlep in wearing your pajama pants either. You never know when working in a coffee shop will turn into <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/08/13/networking-young-man/">a networking opportunity</a> (or a social one), so aim for something comfortable but also a little stylish. My mind also feels sharper and more alert when I’m in “real” clothes rather than lounge wear, and even if a shirt is casual, wearing a button-down of any sort seems to heighten this effect.</p> <p><strong>7. The Writing Utensil: </strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GAOTSW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B001GAOTSW&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20">Pilot G2.</a> My go-to pen for everyday work. Writes like a champ, but cheap enough that you won’t lose any sleep if you accidentally leave it behind.</p> <p><strong>8. The Scratch Pad:</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006HWRK8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B0006HWRK8&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20">Yellow Legal Pad</a>. When I get stuck while writing on my laptop, I start sketching out notes or an outline on a legal pad. I like the yellow expansive canvas to work upon and changing up my medium can often help me overcome a bout of writer’s block.</p> <p><strong>9. The Authorized Distraction:</strong> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553381393/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0553381393&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20">Tides of War</a> </i>by Steven Pressfield. Whether I’m working at home or at a coffee shop, I like to employ a Pomodoro-type method to keep myself productive and on track. I work for a set amount of time, such as 50 minutes, and then take a 10 minute break to do whatever I want. This can mean getting a snack or taking a walk, or reading a book for enjoyment. I just finished <i>The Tides of War. </i>Awesome book about the Peloponnesian War that will inspire your <a title="Got Thumos?" href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/03/11/got-thumos/">manly </a><i><a title="Got Thumos?" href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/03/11/got-thumos/">thumos</a>.</i></p> <p><strong>10. The Beverage.</strong> When you’re working at a coffee shop, you’re squatting on a piece of real estate the owners pay rent for, using the wi-fi they get a bill for, and enjoying the air conditioning that costs them money. So don’t be a leech. Buy a drink every couple hours you’re there. A cup of joe or tea will keep you alert and give you something enjoyable to sip on.</p> <p><strong>11. The Briefcase:</strong> <a href="http://www.idevaffiliate.com/31446/idevaffiliate.php?id=13&#38;url=90" target="_blank">Saddleback Thin Briefcase.</a> You’ll need something to haul your supplies in. Any bag that comfortably fits and organizes all your stuff will do, but if you’re looking for something rugged and handsome that will last a lifetime, look no further than a bag from Saddleback.<a href="http://www.idevaffiliate.com/31446/idevaffiliate.php?id=13&#38;url=84" target="_blank"> I myself have the classic briefcase</a>, but were I to do it over again, I’d probably choose this thin version. The classic is a beast, which is great for traveling, but for my more frequent day-to-day needs, its trimmer brother would have fit the bill better. Whatever kind of bag you get, look for one with a buckle strap you can latch down for security; when you get up to grab something, would-be thieves won’t be able to casually dip their hand into your bag.</p> <p>&#160;</p> <div class='yarpp-related-rss'> <p>Related posts:<ol> <li><a href='http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/06/26/outfitted-equipped-flea-markets/' rel='bookmark' title='Outfitted &#38;

It stretches across a giant valley that has been carved away by the Oldman River. It’s a beautiful area in the heart of the city. The river is surrounded by rolling hills, and the university sits atop them like a boat carried by the waves of the sea. The valley is so deep and just wide enough, that were a train to go down into it, even gradually, it would never come back out. So in an effort to prevent trains from being swallowed in the belly of Lethbridge, early workers built the bridge across the valley. Trains don’t have to dip or climb: they just go straight across. Over 300 feet tall and 1.6 kilometers long (just under one mile), the High Level Bridge, as it’s called, is the largest of its kind. It was completed in 1909 by manly men who probably all had moustaches or beards, wore suspenders or flannel suits, didn’t have safety equipment, and had never driven a car. And I don’t understand how they did it. The bridge has always fascinated me. And from all angles &#8211; from the highways on both sides, underneath it, and even on top of it; whenever I really look at it, I’m in awe. It&#8217;s the symbol of the city and its main attraction. People have their picture taken by it, it’s on postcards, and a Google image search of “Lethbridge” fills the screen with mostly pictures of the bridge. It <i>is</i> Lethbridge, and in a sense, my whole experience living there revolved around the bridge.</p> <p>Early on in my time in Lethbridge, I mentioned in conversation how fascinated I was by the bridge and how I would love to know how it was built. The person I was talking with happened to have recently visited the local museum, where a video is regularly shown that documents the construction of the bridge. Perfect. I was talking to the right person at the right time and my problem was solved. A gift from the universe. But I spit in the universe’s face. Despite my deep interest in the topic, the proximity of the museum, the low admission fee, my flexible student schedule, and the fact that the experience would provide me <i>exactly</i> what I was looking for, I never went. The whole time I lived there, I never went.</p> <p>I’ve thought about this many times. Why didn’t I ever go? Why wouldn’t I do something so easy &#8211; something <i>I wanted to do</i>?</p> <h3><b>Theory of Doing Things</b></h3> <p>Bored out of his mind in Mundare, Alberta (population 855), Albert Bandura decided to grow up to become a world-famous psychologist. And what Albert Bandura decides to do, Albert Bandura does. Now among the most cited psychologists, and clearly a doer of things, Bandura is the authority on getting things done. His Social Cognitive Theory revolves around the concept of <i>self-efficacy</i>. According to Bandura, self-efficacy is, “the belief in one’s capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.” In other words, self-efficacy is your belief in your own ability to do the things you want to do.</p> <p>People with high levels of self-efficacy:</p> <ul> <li>See problems as challenges to overcome, or tasks to be mastered. Even completing small tasks is a source of satisfaction.</li> <li>Develop deep interests and are active participants in various activities. Interests grow and develop and the world seems big.</li> <li>Form a strong sense of commitment to their interests. They don’t go half-way, or start projects and give up quickly.</li> <li>Recover quickly from setbacks and disappointments.</li> </ul> <p>Whereas people with low levels of self-efficacy:</p> <ul> <li>Avoid challenges (or inconveniences) &#8211; big or small (or even very small).</li> <li>Believe difficult things are beyond their abilities. They see other people doing things and assume the position of observer, not participant.</li> <li>Focus on their personal failings. They don’t give themselves credit.</li> <li>Lose confidence easily and quickly, giving up on new things when they’re difficult, uncomfortable, or just different.</li> </ul> <p>I believe the answer to why I didn’t do an easy, and probably enjoyable, thing, lies in this concept of self-efficacy.</p> <p>But what about doing hard things?</p> <h3><b>A Thing I Did</b></h3> <p>The bed was a little wider than my body and not quite as long. It sunk in the middle so it was more like a hammock or a trampoline than a bed. And the blanket was thick and stiff, suspended over the bed like a tarp on a canoe. I had been cold and lost and alone, but found my way to my room to regroup and recuperate. The room smelled like sulfur and I didn’t know what time it was. I didn’t know what time I arrived in Iceland, but found that it was earlier than stores opened. With no coat, no watch, no friends, no map, and no way to get any of those things, finding my room was a victory. Being alone in a strange place hit me hard, so I crumpled myself into my little nook and went to sleep. The nap was a success, and I soon turned things around and had a wonderful three days by myself in Iceland.</p> <p>I had always wanted to go to Iceland. So I went. I spent three days alone there, finding my way around, doing activities, learning some of the culture, navigating the lunar landscape (a tour I went on informed me that NASA took their astronauts to Iceland to get a feel for what it would be like on the moon), getting goods and services without knowing the language, adjusting to the time change and the never-setting sun, exploring and going on excursions, and overcoming low spirits to relax and enjoy. By all accounts, doing all that was much harder than driving down the street to go to a museum. Both were things I wanted to do; I did the hard one and never got around to the easy one. Why? It would be easy to say that going to Iceland is more interesting than going to the museum in Lethbridge, but I believe my fascination with that bridge was equal to my desire to see Iceland. Self-efficacy can provide some answers.</p> <h3><b>Bandura’s Theory of Doing Things, Again</b></h3> <p>According to Bandura, self-efficacy is deep-rooted. It develops in four main ways:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Social modeling.</strong> Seeing other people succeed raises our belief that we too can succeed. This is especially true when the person is within our sphere of influence. We may think things like, “If that regular schmo can do it, I can too.” But it can also go the other way: “If that awesome dude can’t do it, why should I be able to?”</li> <li><strong>Social persuasion.</strong> Encouragement from others makes it easier to do things, and discouragement makes it harder. This can be obvious or subtle. Not getting the encouragement we’re hoping for, even with no direct discouragement, can severely weaken our ability to do things. This shows how fragile self-efficacy can be when not tended to.</li> <li><strong>Mastery experiences.</strong> Bandura says this is the most effective way to develop self-efficacy. Succeeding makes further success easier to attain. But it almost seems stronger going the other way. One failure, no matter how minor, can be a huge blow. Again, self-efficacy is a fragile thing when left on its own.</li> <li><strong>Psychological responses.</strong> Our moods, feelings, physical reactions, stress levels, and other states of mind can affect our levels of self-efficacy. But Bandura notes, “It is not the sheer intensity of emotional and physical reactions that is important, but rather how they are perceived and interpreted.” We can take charge by being aware of them and how they affect our self-efficacy.</li> </ul> <p>But why didn’t I go to the museum?</p> <p>I mentioned above that people with high levels of self-efficacy have deep interests, form deep commitments, recover quickly from setbacks, and take satisfaction from completing tasks and overcoming challenges. People with low levels lose interest and give up easily, remain uninvolved, focus on their failings, and avoid challenges and tasks. So according to that definition, I have both high levels <i>and </i>low levels of self-efficacy: I make deep commitments, have deep interests, and overcome challenges, but also give up easily, and avoid tasks.</p> <p>My own experience tells me that we can have different levels of self-efficacy in different areas, or for different types of tasks. It seems that I have higher self-efficacy in doing more involved things, and low self-efficacy when it comes to smaller tasks. We could categorize tasks in many ways: big, small, medium, long-term, short-term, involved, straightforward, complex, simple, and so on. And I believe if we plotted our levels of self-efficacy on a graph, with self-efficacy on the vertical axis and categories of tasks on the horizontal axis, and connected the dots, most people would have a mountain range. It would be really high in some areas, really low in others, and everything in between. But just as seeing ourselves succeed makes further success more likely, looking at our high levels in one area makes it easier to increase those levels in another. Remembering that I can do big things makes it easier to do small things. And if it’s the other way for you &#8211; small tasks are easier but you avoid big things &#8211; remember that big things are just a lot of small things piled on top of each other.</p> <h3><b>So how do we increase our levels of self-efficacy? </b></h3> <p>The first step is to know yourself. What types of tasks give you difficulty? No one finds everything difficult, but everyone probably struggles with something. Examine your life. Think small for now. Imagine yourself going through a normal day. What do you put off for later? What do you get done right away? Here’s an example from my own life. A typical Ian day:</p> <p>The alarm goes off at 7:00 AM, and I hit the snooze button and get up at 7:10, or sometimes I hit it again and get up at 7:20. If I get up at 7:20 I have to skip breakfast and pick something up at the cafeteria on my way to my office at the college. This late riser’s breakfast is usually a giant muffin and 2% milk. The muffin is delicious but too sweet and it usually gives me the jitters, and by lunchtime I don’t feel like eating. It’s safe to say two snoozes is too many.</p> <p>I head to the shower where I use a giant bottle of shampoo I bought from the dollar store. I didn’t know there’s a difference between shampoos, because I am a man. Now I know there is a difference. The one I use seems to be made of barely more than water, and <i>I guess</i> my hair feels <i>a bit </i>cleaner after using it. I should replace it.</p> <p>I only shave on days my beard feels itchy, even though I don’t look good after two or three days.</p> <p>I get dressed and if there’s time, eat breakfast. If I can get up at 7:00, I have time for eggs and toast. But I don’t usually. So it’s just toast. Not bad, but the protein from the eggs makes me feel virile and supercharged, and I miss it when I don’t have it.</p> <p>I drive to work in my car with the burnt out signal light and overused oil and park far from the office because I enjoy the walk. I get to my office and sign on to work email, which is usually empty, and personal email, which is usually full. I keep my phone on my desk and respond to texts and emails as they arrive. I have intermittent periods of focus throughout the day. I wonder if I have Attention Deficit Disorder, or if I’m just a modern human. The project I’m working on at work is very interesting, and I have innovative and exciting ideas about it, but only manage to focus on it in short spurts. When a thought comes to mind, I act on it &#8211; no matter how unimportant or unrelated it is. The internet on my computer is very fast, and I can find answers to my stupid questions very quickly. <i>Is Channing Tatum in both G.I. Joe movies? </i>BAM! Imdb. <i>I wonder how some people rack up so many frequent flyer miles. </i>BAM! Travel blogs everywhere. <i>Did Stephanie Meyer think of the idea for The Host before or after Twilight? </i>BAM! Um&#8230;I don’t know where I’d find that one. I’ve never actually wondered that, but you get the idea. Each of these detours lead to more and sometimes I’ll go for a while before realizing I’m off-track. Then I’ll get back on track, get on a roll, and make major progress on my project. And then it happens again. Whenever possible I do my work off of the computer to avoid this problem.</p> <p>I come home for lunch because I enjoy seeing my family, and the food there is freer and healthier than what I’d get at work.</p> <p>After work I make a list of things I want to get done that evening. An old note in front of me now has two tasks related to the business I’m starting, and one administrative task. I did the two business related ones, and still haven’t done the other.</p> <p>I spend time with my family. Now that the weather is nice, we try to do something outside and avoid watching tv or movies. We’ve gone on picnics, walks, played at the park, threw the ball for the dog, and other things. My family is the most important part of my life, and I make it a priority to spend time with them, even when I have other things to do.</p> <p>We read before bed because we both enjoy it. We do it even when we get too bed late.</p> <h3><b>My Self-Efficacy Strengths and Weaknesses</b></h3> <p><b>Strengths:</b></p> <p>I’ll start here because the weaknesses are more obvious.</p> <ul> <li>I’m good at working on big things and things that have long-term impact. This includes the project at work.</li> <li>When I set priorities, I stick with them. Time with my family is non-negotiable. I think reading is one of the better ways to use time, so I make sure to do it regularly. I’m conscious of my health. That doesn’t mean I always make the right choice, but choosing to eat at home is a good choice that I make regularly.</li> </ul> <p><b>Weaknesses:</b></p> <ul> <li>I’m bad at small things.</li> <li>I snooze.</li> <li>I use gross shampoo.</li> <li>I sacrifice a good breakfast.</li> <li>I shave as little as possible.</li> <li>I ignore problems with the car because I can’t be bothered to take the time to do the minor repairs.</li> <li>I get easily distracted at work.</li> <li>I only do items on my list that will bring long-term benefits.</li> <li>And so on.</li> </ul> <p>It’s a bit humbling to look at how much I suck. But it’s a good start to figuring out how to suck less.</p> <p>I encourage you to do the same exercise. Think about your day, and print off this page and fill in these blanks (or write your answers on another piece of paper at least &#8211; but actually do it, fellow Manly Doer of Things).</p> <blockquote><p>Strengths:</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>List 5 things you got done today.</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p> <p>Weaknesses:</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>List 5 things you should have done today, but didn’t do.</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p> <p>_____</p></blockquote> <p>The weaknesses should be easier to spot. But focus on your strengths. When you understand your strengths &#8211; the areas where your self-efficacy is high &#8211; you can understand how to improve your weaknesses. Let’s look at me again.</p> <p>I’m good at doing long-term or complex things, and avoid doing smaller and simpler things. It’s much easier to buy a bottle of shampoo than it is to build a business. It might be easy to say I’m more excited about building a business than I am about getting shampoo. And that might be true. But when I do finally get around to replacing the shampoo, I’ll feel very satisfied and look forward to using it. <b>Completing any task always brings some level of satisfaction</b>. Often the satisfaction level is the same from completing small tasks as it is from completing big ones. But I avoid the smaller tasks.</p> <p>When I look closely, I see how little this makes sense. <b>Any long-term, big, complex, complicated, multi-faceted, in-depth task is just a bunch of small tasks in a row. And there are no exceptions. </b>Completing each of these small tasks is no more satisfying than buying a new bottle of shampoo. Even just keeping that in mind helps make any type of small task more manageable.</p> <p>Or we could look at it the other way around.</p> <p>If I’m motivated by long-term benefits, it helps to realize that each small task has a long term benefit. And again, <b>there are no exceptions. </b>They may not be earth-changing benefits, but they are benefits. Fixing my car will save me money on more serious repairs later. New shampoo will keep my hair healthier, because there’s no way the slime I use now does it any good. Getting up one snooze earlier means better breakfast and better health.</p> <p>But maybe your self-assessment had the opposite results.</p> <p>Maybe you’re good at getting every item on your list done, but you have big dreams, goals, plans, or tasks that you don’t bother with.</p> <p>I think you already know what to do. But to illustrate, here’s a story. Anne Lamott relates the story behind the title of her guide to writing, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SEGI8Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B000SEGI8Q&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20" target="_blank"><em>Bird by Bird</em></a>:</p> <blockquote><p>&#8220;Thirty years ago my older brother, who was ten years old at the time, was trying to get a report on birds written that he&#8217;d had three months to write. It was due the next day. We were out at our  family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen  table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper  and pencils and unopened books on birds,  immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my brother&#8217;s shoulder, and said, &#8216;Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote> <p>Remember, big tasks are just a bunch of little tasks piled on top of each other. Use what you know about getting small things done. Start small, and take it task by task.</p> <p>Understanding is a giant step to overcoming. Thinking like Bad-Ass Bandura (as his friends probably called him) &#8212; consciously tending to your self-efficacy and realizing it is a driving force behind your actions or inactions &#8212; will open up your whole life and jump-start your progress as a man. Few things are manlier or more satisfying than doing exactly what you set out to do.</p> <p>_____________________</p> <p><em>Ian Walker is a normal guy with a good life who wants to enjoy it even more.

But as they pick up and examine the present tucked inside, their smile quickly fades. “You know, this watch really isn’t right for me. Here, you can have it back.”</p> <p>Ouch. Such behavior is so uncommon you may (thankfully) never have witnessed it or done it yourself. Yet the majority of us regularly do something very similar when it comes to accepting another kind of “gift”: compliments.</p> <p>Even though <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/12/13/too-seldom-is-heard-an-encouraging-word-why-and-how-to-offer-more-compliments/">we should all be offering more compliments</a>, many of us struggle to do so. And yet graciously accepting compliments can be a challenge as well. We’re eager to get them and so pleased when we do, but then we utterly fumble their receipt. Instead of accepting compliments with pleasure and appreciation, we look for ways to downgrade, reject, and deflect their significance and value.</p> <p>Learning how to best take a compliment is pretty easy (even if changing an ingrained behavior takes some practice). You simply have to understand 1) how you dismiss compliments, 2) why you have trouble accepting them outright, and 3) why and how you can graciously acknowledge and accept the praise of others.</p> <h3><b>10 Ways Compliments Are Dismissed</b></h3> <p>Sociolinguists place compliment responses into 3 main categories: Accept, Deflect, and Reject. These categories represent a spectrum, and most people aren’t uncomfortable at either extreme; outright denial seems rude but full acceptance feels conceited. Thus, most people seek what seems like a safe middle ground, choosing a deflecting response that dilutes and mitigates the compliment. They see compliments as hot potatoes that need to be tossed on as soon as they land in their hands.</p> <p>In <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1572242094/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1572242094&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20">The Assertiveness Workbook</a></i>, Randy Paterson lists some of the different ways we reject and deflect compliments, to which I’ve added a few I’ve observed myself.</p> <p><b>1. Ignore</b></p> <p>The recipient ignores the compliment, either because he didn’t hear it, or because he doesn’t recognize that he’s being complimented.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “You played crazy good today – you were all over the court.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Yeah, I’m really thirsty. Let’s stop for some Gatorade on the way home.”</i></p> <p><b>2. Denial</b></p> <p>The recipient denies the compliment outright.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “You guys sounded so good tonight.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Yeah right. We sounded like total crap.”  </i></p> <p><b>3. Arguing</b></p> <p>The recipient of the compliment argues against his deserving the given praise.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “That was a really profound insight you brought up in class.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Not really. Anyone who had read the previous cases would have come to the same conclusion.” </i></p> <p><b>4. Self-Insult</b></p> <p>The receiver downplays the praise by offering self-deprecating remarks.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “That’s a really spiffy hat.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Well I need something to draw attention from my ugly mug!”</i></p> <p><b>5. Questioning</b></p> <p>The receiver questions the giver’s judgment, taste, etc. in offering the compliment.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “Your photography is definitely the best exhibit here.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Are you kidding? You must not have gone to very many art shows in your life.”</i></p> <p><b>6. Narrowing</b></p> <p>The receiver whittles down a broader compliment into a smaller one.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “You’re looking really dashing tonight.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “This tie can make any suit look good.”</i></p> <p><b>7. Boomerang</b></p> <p>In response to a compliment, the receiver fires one back.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “That is one sweet ‘stache!”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Well that’s a heck of a manly beard you’ve got there!”</i></p> <p><b>8. Reassurance</b></p> <p>The receiver has trouble accepting the compliment and seeks confirmation.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “Your speech was incredibly convincing.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “Do you really think so? I felt like I was floundering out there.”</i></p> <p><b>9. De-Value</b></p> <p>The recipient suggests that the thing being complimented isn’t as great as the complimenter is suggesting.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “That’s a really handsome sweater.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “It’s so old. I’ve had it since high school.”</i></p> <p><b>10. Credit Transfer</b></p> <p>The recipient transfers the praise to others.</p> <p><i>Compliment: “I think that was the best dance we’ve ever had.”</i></p> <p><i>Response: “It was really Jill who did all the work and made it happen.” </i></p> <h3><b>Why We Deflect Compliments</b></h3> <p>Paterson gives the following reasons for why people struggle to fully accept a compliment, to which I’ve again added a couple reasons I also think bear mentioning.</p> <p><b>Fear of being seen as conceited.</b> This is by far the most common reason people deflect a compliment. They worry that by agreeing with someone else’s praise of them, they are essentially praising themselves and thus being smug.</p> <p><b>The need to restore “balance.”</b> Since a compliment is a positive act, you may feel a psychological need to balance things out by either negating the praise through deflection, or by quickly returning the compliment.</p> <p><b>The desire to avoid “indebtedness.”</b> This is the worry that if someone does something nice for you like offering a compliment, you will then “owe” them something nice in return and will thus be indebted to them in some way.</p> <p><b>Having low self-esteem.</b> If someone says something nice about you that you don’t believe about yourself, your immediate reaction will be to deny or disbelieve it. You can’t integrate the complimenter’s positive view of you into your own negative one, so you look for ways to find their assessment faulty – i.e., they missed the mistakes you made or they don’t have good judgment.</p> <p><b>Inability to be assertive.</b> Guys who struggle with <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/02/12/how-to-be-assertive/">being assertive</a> often find accepting compliments to be a struggle. They have a hard time taking ownership of their positive qualities and feel like acknowledging praise isn’t something a “nice guy” would do.</p> <p><b>Suspicion of motives.</b> You may reject someone’s compliments if you’re suspicious that they’re just trying to flatter you and butter you up for some reason. This suspicion may be legitimate or it may come from an overly cynical worldview and be rooted in trust issues.</p> <p><b>Desire to look even better.</b> People will sometimes use false modesty as a way of trying to make themselves look even better. For example, Bob compliments Jake on giving a top-notch presentation, and Jake, who actually spent a few dozen hours preparing it, says, “Oh, it was just something I threw together.” Now Bob is thinking, “Wow, if he just threw that together, imagine what he could do if he spent a lot of time on something!” Alternatively, someone may seek to add modesty to the other qualities they’re being complimented on. So Mike tells Andy, “I really appreciate how thorough you made this report.” To which Andy responds, “It was nothing. Just doing my job.” Andy may want Mike to think, “He’s not only a diligent employee, but so humble to boot!”</p> <h3><b>Why You Should Graciously and Fully Accept Compliments</b></h3> <p>Sociolinguists have found that Americans respond to compliments with a deflecting response a whopping two-thirds of the time. While this kind of response may be popular, it’s not very smart or even polite. This is an area where you should definitely try to break the mold of the mainstream. Here’s why.</p> <p><b>Denial and deflection insults the giver.</b> When someone offers you a compliment, they’re saying that they’ve observed and assessed a praiseworthy quality in you. When you deflect or deny that praise, you’re basically contradicting them; you’re saying that they don’t have good judgment, discernment, or taste, or that they’re insincere – that they don’t know what they’re talking about. You’re returning their kind words with an insult.</p> <p><b>Denial and deflection make the giver feel uncomfortable.</b> When we dismiss a compliment because it makes us uncomfortable, we simply transfer that discomfort to the giver. Not only do you insult them, but as Paterson puts it, rejecting a compliment often makes the giver feel “awkward, uncomfortable, stupid, or frustrated.” Where do they go from there? They’re now stuck with the tiresome task of offering reassurance of their sincerity…”No I really do think so…”</p> <p>Be a man and eat the discomfort yourself instead of tossing it back like a hot potato.</p> <p><b>Denial and deflection decrease the likelihood of someone complimenting you again.</b> When you always wave off people&#8217;s compliments, eventually they won’t bother to offer them at all anymore.</p> <p><b>Denial and deflection diminishes your value.</b> A compliment shows that someone sees value in you. When you dismiss those compliments you’re telling them that either you do not have the qualities they thought you did, or that you’re so insecure you can’t even recognize and/or acknowledge that you do. Either way, it diminishes your value in their eyes. This makes you unattractive to the ladies who like a man to be confident. It also isn’t impressive to your employer. If you’re always telling your boss that so-and-so is really the one who deserves all the credit for the success on a project, why should they give you a raise or even keep you around?</p> <p><b>You lose out on the good feeling that comes with a compliment.</b> Getting a nice compliment can make you feel great. But when you deflect and devalue the compliment instead of absorbing it, you also deflect the positive boost it could have given your self-esteem.</p> <p><b>Boomerang compliments aren’t usually sincere.</b> You may think that always responding to a compliment with one of your own is polite, but it’s not. A boomerang compliment signals that instead of <i>listening</i> to and absorbing someone’s praise, you were busy formulating your own compliment. And because people know it’s a knee-jerk behavior that’s designed to mitigate your own discomfort, that it’s more about <i>you</i> than it is about <i>them, </i>it doesn’t register as sincere. It’s far better to offer your own compliment at another, appropriate time, so that it comes off as spontaneous and authentic, rather than coerced. There are exceptions to this rule, of course (see below).</p> <h3><b>How to Accept a Compliment</b></h3> <p>The first step in quitting the faux modesty of the compliment deflection routine is to realize that fully accepting compliments does not make you conceited. You didn’t come up with the praise yourself, someone else did! You’re just confirming another person’s assessment, and again, it’s more polite to accept and appreciate their judgment rather than to contradict it.</p> <p>Second, it’s okay to let yourself feel proud of something you did well. A little pride need not involve an inflated sense of your accomplishments or worthy qualities – just an honest assessment of what you did. It’s quite possible to be modest, while still being grateful and gracious.</p> <p>So what’s the best response to a compliment? Get ready for it…”<i><strong>Thank you</strong>.”</i> That’s it. There’s never a situation where a simple, unadorned thank you won’t work.</p> <p>That being said, sometimes it’s more comfortable and quite appropriate to offer a follow-up to your “thank you,” or an amplifier that shows just how much the compliment meant to you.</p> <p>Appropriate follow-ups to “Thank you”:</p> <ul> <li>“I really enjoyed it.” “I’m glad it worked out so well.” If you feel uncomfortable just leaving it at “thank you,” try a neutral follow-up statement.</li> <li>“It couldn’t have happened without Jason’s help.” Now, giving a knee-jerk response in which you deny all credit to yourself and transfer it to others is faux modesty. But, when other people really do deserve some credit for the things you’re being praised for, it’s appropriate to mention those folks, <i>after </i>accepting credit for your own role.</li> <li>“I am happy I could help.” This is a good alternative to the “Just doing my job” deflection. Maybe you were just doing your job, but don’t rebuff and deny someone’s desire to show their appreciation for you. Instead, offer a “thank you” and tell them you’re happy you could be of assistance.</li> <li>&#8220;You know, you also played great tonight; nice job!” The boomerang compliment can be appropriate when it&#8217;s truly sincere &#8212; praise you would have given anyway &#8212; and especially when you won&#8217;t see the person again (this is often the case in competition situations). Just be sure to offer your compliment after you’ve fully accepted the one you’ve been given.</li> </ul> <p>If a compliment is particularly heartwarming or special to you, there’s nothing wrong with following up your “thank you” with an amplifier that tells the giver what the compliment means to you, how it makes you feel, or why you value it:</p> <ul> <li>“That really means a lot.”</li> <li>“I really appreciate you noticing that. No one ever has before.”</li> <li>“I was feeling really down and this is just the encouragement I need to keep going.”</li> </ul> <p>Now go forward and offer many more compliments to others and acknowledge and accept the ones that come your way with class!</p> <div class='yarpp-related-rss'> <p>Related posts:<ol> <li><a href='http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/12/15/manvotional-do-it-now/'

—Kipling</p></blockquote> <p>Strength is the glory of manhood. Beauty is not, for beauty is only to be displayed. Culture is not, for culture is chiefly for self-glorification. Fluency is not; a parrot may be fluent. Agreeability is not; a fool may make himself agreeable. Not smoothness, nor plausibility; not softness nor polish, but strength is the glory of manhood. Manhood and strength are synonymous.</p> <p>Where in all the sweep of freaks and failures, of mawkish sentiments and senseless blathery, can there be found an object to excite deeper disgust than one of these thin, vapid, affected, driveling little doodles dressed up in men&#8217;s clothes, but without a thimbleful of brains in his pate or an ounce of manhood in his anatomy? He is worse than weak—he is a weaklet. What can he do? He can squeak with his little voice, strut with his unathletic members and gabble diluted twaddle. He can sigh and pose and outclass the monkey in apish arts. This shitepoke specimen of man tells us that he is tired of life, but of work he can never grow tired, for to that he is a stranger. He affects to look with great disdain on common toil and common people, but the world is grateful that such a specimen of the genus homo is himself uncommon.</p> <p>Many a man has failed in life for no other reason save that he was weak. He had a good heart, but he was weak. He was popular, generous, gentlemanly, but weak. His opportunities were fine, his capital ample, his future inspiring, but he was weak and went to nothing. The ideal Christian has something to him besides syllabub. He must do more than sing Psalms, and testify in the meeting. He is not at his best when the world slaps him in the face, knocks him down, and stamps him. He must be humble, but also strong. He must practice self-denial, but should also possess self-respect. He is taught to forgive his enemies, but also to be angry and sin not. A lovely priest in Paris had incurred the enmity of the sectarians by his liberality. One day a bigot, who was also a bully, met him on the street and dealt him a rousing blow on the cheek. Quietly the lovely priest turned, saying: &#8220;My Master teaches me when thus struck to turn the other cheek also.&#8221; Delivering a still heavier blow on that cheek, the bully said: &#8220;And what does your master tell you now?&#8221; To this the lovely priest replied, as he laid aside his cloak, &#8220;The authorities are divided, but the weight of authority is in favor of the view which I now adopt as I proceed to give you the worst thrashing of your life.&#8221; It is not likely that at the final reckoning, the lovely priest will find much against him for that day&#8217;s work.</p> <p>Strength calls for self-restraint and self-control, but also for self-respect and self-assertion.</p> <p>If one expects to amount to anything in life, he must be strong. Barriers are to be surmounted, discouragements silenced, temptations resisted, and for all this there is needed a manhood invincible and self-reliant, strong.</p> <p>The voice of our highest destiny speaks. It points the way to the summit, achievement of life&#8217;s best ambition. It voices our deepest and constant need. It says: &#8220;Be strong.&#8221;</p> <p>What is strength?</p> <p>It is the absence of excuse-making. &#8220;If I had that fellow&#8217;s chance, if my circumstances were different, if my capital were larger&#8221;—out upon all such unmanly whimpering. The music of strength is not set in the key of whines. We must accept life as it is and make the best of it. Whenever a speaker begins with an apology, you may know his audience is to feed on chaff. Strength strikes the word &#8220;excuse&#8221; from its vocabulary.</p> <blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8216;If I were a man,&#8217; said the restless lad,<br /> &#8216;I&#8217;d never give up and be still and sad.<br /> Were my name but known in the lists of life<br /> I&#8217;d never say &#8220;die&#8221; till I&#8217;d won the strife.<br /> But who will challenge the steel of youth,<br /> Though his heart be brave and his motto &#8220;truth?&#8221;<br /> There&#8217;s work to be done in this life&#8217;s short span,<br /> But alack-a-day! I am not a man.&#8217;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8216;If I were a boy,&#8217; said the toiler gray,<br /> &#8216;I&#8217;d fashion my lot in a better way.<br /> I&#8217;d hope and labor both day and night<br /> And make ambition my beacon light.<br /> I&#8217;d bend the oar, nor drift nor dream<br /> Were my bark but launched upon youth&#8217;s bright stream,<br /> Till I reach the haven of peace and joy—<br /> But, alack-a-day! I am not a boy.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote> <p>Strength never comes down to such sentimental doggerel as this. It may fail, but it will bear defeat with fortitude.</p> <p>Strength is industry. Hard work is only another name for genius. Weakness is often only another name for laziness. It may call itself indisposition, leisure, or some other highsounding platitude, but that doesn&#8217;t change the sluggish inside. A lazy man is a butt of ridicule for all creation. He may have a bank account, but in the world of brawn and brain he is a dummy. The men who have achieved conspicuous success in medicine, law, literature, art, trade, have all been tireless workers. Strength is self-reliance.</p> <p>Henry Ward Beecher used to tell this story of how he was taught when a boy to depend on himself.</p> <blockquote><p>&#8220;I was sent to the blackboard, and went, uncertain, full of whimpering.</p> <p>&#8220;&#8216;That lesson must be learned,&#8217; said my teacher in a quiet tone, but with terrible intensity. All explanations and excuses he trod under foot with utter scornfulness. &#8216;I want that problem; I don&#8217;t want any reason why you haven&#8217;t it,&#8217; he would say.</p> <p>&#8221;I did study two hours.&#8217;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s nothing to me; I want the lesson. You need not study it at all, or you may study it ten hours, just to suit yourself. I want the lesson.&#8217;</p> <p>&#8220;It was tough for a green boy, but it seasoned me. In less than a month, I had the most intense sense of intellectual independence and courage to defend my recitations.</p> <p>&#8220;One day his cold, calm voice fell upon me in the midst of a demonstration, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p> <p>&#8220;I hesitated, and then went back to the beginning; and, on reaching the same point again, &#8216;No!&#8217; uttered in atone of conviction, barred my progress.</p> <p>&#8220;&#8216;The next!&#8217; And I sat down in red confusion.</p> <p>&#8220;He, too, was stopped with &#8216;No!&#8217; but went right on, finished, and, as he sat down, was rewarded with &#8216;Very well.&#8217;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8216;Why,&#8217; whimpered I, &#8216;I recited it just as he did, and you said &#8220;No!&#8217;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you say &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and stick to it? It is not enough to know your lesson; you must know that you know it. You have learned nothing until you are sure. If all the world says &#8220;No,&#8221; your business is to say &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and prove it.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote> <p>One must be sure of himself. He must have self-poise. This is not conceit. Conceit is all wind, and the point of a cambric needle can puncture it to death. Self-reliance is the absence of timidity. It is alertness and forethought. It is preparation and decision.</p> <p>Strength is reliable as well as self-reliant. It may be counted on when the fight waxes hot. One must command the confidence of others as well as his own. The wretched thing about so many who fail is that they cannot be depended on. They are goody-goody, but not reliable. It is a waste of time to dread the disagreeable. It must be faced promptly and duty manfully met.</p> <p>There must be moral as well as physical strength. There must be the courage that stands to its convictions, whatever people may think or say. The hardest mouth to face is not the cannon&#8217;s. It is rather that from whose throat comes the insistent roar of the fickle populace. The majestic strength of royal manhood treats this as an elephant does a fly.</p> <p>There are temptations to be resisted. Nothing short of moral strength suffices for this. Innumerable iniquities solicit tolerance or indulgence, and if yielded to, they will damn here as well as hereafter. A young man came to Nashville a church member and with a clean moral record behind him. He had unusual advantages for success in a noble profession. But he began going to the devil for no other reason than he was weak. His companions were the kind that make the public suspicious, and the people who associate with them impure and dishonest. Two years were enough to bring his prospects in life to zero. He will whine about his poor chances, and the little encouragement given by friends. The truth is he killed his chances with moral cowardice. Strength means moral courage, and ability to stand against ridicule and popular clamor. Strength is not like the willow that bends low to every breeze, but rather like the oak that stands stiff in the tempest, or like the granite cliff against which the mad sea dashes itself to pieces, or like the mountains that lift their calm faces toward the silent stars defiant of all the bluff of storm.</p> <p>This is what it means to be strong, and before such a life the world makes way. Such manhood is in command. The world grows roomy now. In state and church, in public and private life, in work for men and work for God, the call is for men of strength.</p> <p>Strong in purpose and strong in action; strong within and strong without; strong against foes that are seen and strong against foes that are unseen; all the way up and all the way down, all the way around and all the way through; first, last and always—strong! It needs neither title nor crown to argue the imperial majesty of such manhood.</p> <div class='yarpp-related-rss'> <p>Related posts:<ol> <li><a href='http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/08/11/manvotional-the-majesty-of-calmness/' rel='bookmark' title='Manvotional: The Majesty of Calmness'>Manvotional: The Majesty of Calmness</a></li> <li><a href='http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/01/03/manvotional-the-kingship-of-self-control/' rel='bookmark' title='Manvotional: The Kingship of Self-Control'>Manvotional: The Kingship of Self-Control</a></li> <li><a href='http://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/06/28/manvotional-a-nations-strength-by-ralph-waldo-emerson/' rel='bookmark' title='Manvotional: &#8220;A Nation&#8217;s Strength&#8221;

This particular book has also influenced countless individuals in their own lives, helping shape them into better people, but it isn’t a self-help book. It is a book about stories, and storytelling — the stories that drive our societies, and the way we tell them. And because of the commonalities of those stories, it is very much a book about <i>us</i>, and the way we view the world.</p> <p>More importantly, it’s about how we can become better men. The book is about self-actualization at its core and has a replicable approach that applies to every man.</p> <p><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1577315936/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1577315936&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20" target="_blank">The Hero with A Thousand Faces</a>,</i> by Joseph Campbell, is ostensibly about myths and mythology. But the lessons in this book can help us identify and navigate the paths we take to better ourselves and the changes in our lives, in order to become better at change, and better people in general.</p> <p>Campbell, a professor at Sara Lawrence College, studied lore from every conceivable culture; he looked at everything from the ancient religions of antiquity to the mythology of more modern religions like Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.</p> <p>Campbell&#8217;s research led him to focus on <i>comparative mythology; </i>specifically, he looked at what myths from different cultures had in common, rather than what they didn’t. Everywhere Campbell searched, he found it: a single story-telling arc, the ubiquitous story that every culture from Mesopotamia to our modern Western Society uses to pass along information, tradition, and worldly perception. Collectively, Campbell put this information into his seminal and most influential work, <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i>.</p> <p>Borrowing a term of James Joyce, Campbell called this universal pattern <i>the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth" target="_blank">monomyth</a></i>. You might know it as <strong>the Hero’s Journey.</strong></p> <p>It is a single myth, told in a thousand different ways; a single hero, with a thousand different faces. The monomyth is in every story you’ve ever heard, most of the movies you’ve ever seen — and it’s present in your own life, every day. And understanding it can make you a better man.</p> <h3><b>The Hero’s Journey and Why It’s Important</b></h3> <p>The monomyth begins with the main character, or Hero, in one place, and ends with him in another — both physically and emotionally. Campbell asserts that this Hero is the same regardless of the story, and that he appears in different forms. This is important because the hero can be the star quarterback or he can be the accountant in cubicle nine. The paths are different but the journey is the same.</p> <p>Within each journey, the Hero will encounter other characters that play an essential role in growth. Campbell labeled these <i>archetypes (</i>the Herald, the Mentor, the Goddess, the Trickster, etc.)<i>,</i> and they appear in the vast majority of stories. It’s easy to spot an archetype once you know what you’re looking for. So whether the hero is Harry Potter or King Arthur or Frodo, his path is always very similar. Whether the mentor is Dumbledore or Merlin or Gandalf, his role is always to guide the hero.</p> <p>This structure appears everywhere, but is most easily recognized in movies and books. Luke Skywalker starts his journey by leaving his home on Tatooine, having grand adventures, and fulfilling his potential as a Jedi. The events might be different, but the journey is the same one King Arthur takes. And this is the same exact course that prominent figures in religious stories all follow. Campbell shows us just how accurate this concept is, and how it replays over and over again. And it’s happening right now in your life, too.</p> <p>Not yet convinced? Okay, let’s break it down with some examples and let’s take a look at the steps of the Hero’s Journey. While Campbell’s model is 17 stages, for the sake of brevity, I prefer the more abbreviated version used by Christopher Vogler in his book <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193290736X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=193290736X&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20" target="_blank">The Writer’s Journey</a>.</i></p> <div id="attachment_34626" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 459px"><img class="size-full wp-image-34626" alt="vogsmall" src="http://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2013/07/vogsmall.jpg" width="449" height="353" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Vogler’s model of the Hero’s Journey.</p></div> <p style="text-align: left;">Now, looking at that picture, as well as chart below, you’ll probably get a good idea of what each stage signifies based on the name;

it’s that the commonalities in storytelling exist because they are a fundamental part of the human experience. The monomyth isn’t <i>only</i> the structure of how we tell the undertakings of heroes and characters in stories, it’s also how we relate those stories to ourselves, and, in a very real way, how we understand the things that are happening to us.</p> <p>I would take it a step further.</p> <p>I believe that while the monomyth is exceptional for storytelling, and therefore exceptional for exploring cultural ideas, it can have just as great an impact when applied to an individual — when applied to <i>you</i>. <b>Put somewhat more directly, the Hero’s Journey is the perfect lens through which to view <i>any</i> change in your life — whatever new journey you’re taking, you will go through all of the phases of the monomyth as you grow, adapt, and ultimately fulfill your goal.</b></p> <p>Of course, I’m not the only one who suggests this. For years, the Campbellian model has been used by people in various fields to help people advance; for example, some therapists use it with their patients to help structure psychoanalysis. Similarly, it’s used to help people deal with the grieving process — after all, the 5 stages are grief each have their mirror in the monomyth. Still others use it for mindset or success coaching — helping people understand where they are in the journey not only provides a sense of comfort and control, but also a clear path, making it easier, conceptually, to get to the next phase.</p> <p>Because all changes in your life can fit into this structure, whether you realize it or not, at any given time you’re going through at least one such journey — and mastering the ideology of the monomyth will make you more successful. Because not only is the Hero’s Journey a lens for viewing change, but it’s also an excellent operating thesis for propelling change forward.</p> <h3><b>Practical Application – the Journey of a Gym Rat</b></h3> <p>My exposure to Joseph Campbell and to the gym came at roughly the same period of time in my life. I was a sophomore in college and in need of massive changes to my mind and body. I was 25 pounds overweight, clinically depressed, and generally just unhappy. An inauspicious beginning to my tale, but true nonetheless. That year, I was assigned to read <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i> in a class on Utopian/Dystopian literature. Within the first 30 pages, I was hooked.</p> <p>At that point, I certainly didn’t think I’d found a problem-solving methodology, but being a guy who was heavily into medieval fantasy and mythology, Campbell spoke to me as a storyteller. Reading <i>Hero</i> was immediately beneficial: it made all the books I was already reading even more accessible, and enjoyable. (And believe me, at 19, it was hard to imagine anything that could make re-reading <em>T</em><i>he Lord of the Rings </i>for the eighth time even more enjoyable — <i>Hero</i> did.)</p> <p>Around this same time, I entered a gym, underwent a massive physical transformation, and changed my life in a number of ways. Not only did I build an impressive physique that opened a number of professional doors from fitness modeling and personal training to writing, but I also learned a variety of lessons that have carried over to every aspect of my life, and became successful in ways I couldn’t have imagined.</p> <p>It might seem a little silly to think that getting fit helped me do better in school and have better relationships, and sillier still that it eventually allowed me to start my own business, live life on my terms, and even write a book. But it’s all true.</p> <p>Perhaps more importantly, my transformation, and the lead up to it, was a step-by-step retracing of the Hero’s Journey. As I said, all changes can fit into this model. Let’s take a look at mine.</p> <p><b>The Ordinary World</b> – I was fat and depressed, but didn’t know much else. Like Harry Potter under the stairs or Frodo in the Shire, my Ordinary World was my everyday life.</p> <p><b>The Call to Adventure </b>– In my case, it was an actual phone call. At this point in my life, I was working in a retail store (Gap, of all places), and a woman called asking me to have 30 white polo shirts ready for her when she walked in. Long story short, it turned out her husband was opening a gym about 5 minutes from my house. At the moment, I wanted to make a change. Now, “I need 30 white polo shirts,” isn’t quite as dramatic as “Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi; you&#8217;re my only hope,&#8221; but it got the job done.</p> <p><b>Refusal of the Call</b> &#8211; Change is hard. Sometimes the Hero is more afraid of change than they are of continuing to be unhappy in their situation, or body. The majority of the people who want to embark on a fitness journey (or any journey, for that matter) never get past this point; they think it will be too hard, or that they <i>can&#8217;t</i> change. Or, they start and simply give up. In my case, although I was interested in changing, I was nervous, and it took a few days before I mustered up the resolve to go check out the gym.</p> <p><b>Meeting with the Mentor </b>- Heroes can&#8217;t do everything on their own; we all need mentors. When I finally walked into the gym, I met the owner, Alvin. He had an encouraging manner and an inspiring physique. I took to him immediately, and let him guide me. When it comes to changing your body, that mentor doesn’t necessarily need to be a person with whom you have direct contact; the role of the mentor can <i>also</i> be filled by a book or even website. The author will help you without ever meeting you.</p> <p><b>Cross the First Threshold</b> &#8211; Threshold crossings happen throughout journeys, and the first is always the most impactful. It&#8217;s what separates the Ordinary World from the Special World. When I first joined the gym and started reading about fitness, it was like Dorothy stepping into Oz; there was so much to take in it was intimidating.</p> <p><b>Tests, Allies, Enemies</b> – As I began on my transformative journey, I quickly realized that there were people who wanted to help, and people who didn’t. Some people will support your fitness goals and avoid tempting you; others will call your goals silly and vain. Every time I went to a party or dinner, I had to deal with the invariable, <i>&#8220;Just have a bit</i>e,&#8221; or, <i>&#8220;Just one drink.&#8221;</i> These things are tempting, but to make my transformation a reality, I had to pass these tests.</p> <p><b>Approach</b> – As I prepared for the final showdown — the real meat of the transformation — I had to arm myself to go through it. There were a lot of small events during this time &#8212; cleaning out your fridge and throwing all the junk away, restocking with healthy food, mastering proper exercise form, and learning about nutrition.</p> <p><b>Central Ordeal</b> &#8211; The Ordeal is about the act of change, and the necessity for it. As it applied to changing my body, this was the actual transformation program — that 16-week period where I focused ardently and made it my goal to bend my body to my will. Metaphorically, the Ordeal is about the war between the light and dark halves of your psyche, and your attempt to balance them.</p> <p><b>Apotheosis/Resurrection</b> – Anyone who has gone through a major transformation understands that the results of the Ordeal are pretty intense. In almost all cases, you achieve a sense of heightened awareness &#8212; not necessarily supreme enlightenment, but, at the very least, an unveiling of a world or experience previously hidden from your eyes. In my case, this was the realization that being fit <i>was </i>possible for me, and that all of the benefits of being in this &#8220;club&#8221; were mine. As a storytelling device, apotheosis is about becoming godlike, at least for a moment; in most cases, this only occurs when the character sets aside all resistance and fully gives in to the experience. In that moment, you will not be a god, but you will be like a phoenix &#8212; your new, better self rising from the ashes of the old one you&#8217;ve left behind.</p> <p><b>Seizing the Sword</b>/<b>Reward</b> &#8211; This is what you get after the battle &#8212; something for you. It&#8217;s when the heroes gather together and say, &#8220;W<i>ow, look what we&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</i> It may be a celebration, or a love scene. For me, it was an increase in self-esteem and health that accompanied my new body. Much more than that was the belief in myself that I could manifest change; I’d done this thing which I previously thought impossible, which instilled in me an unshakeable belief that I could do just about anything.</p> <p><b>The Road Back</b> &#8211; After the battle itself is over, the Hero must return home. This is sometimes more difficult than leaving in the first place. The Road Back is emotionally trying, because you fear that you&#8217;ll lose what you gained on the quest. In my case, I had some trepidation that once I was no longer in the throes of focusing on a transformation, I’d revert back to my former self.</p> <p><b>Return with the Elixir</b> – In the best of cases, Rewards are not just for the Hero, but also for everyone around him. Frodo destroying the One Ring brought peace to Middle-Earth; Harry Potter destroying Voldemort did the same for the wizarding world. Well, my transformation sadly didn’t end any wars or save the world, but it <i>did</i> help a lot of people. The act of changing helped me become a better version of myself; many of my better qualities were amplified. I was happier, and made other people happier; I was also more helpful, more dedicated, and (strangely) more punctual. My transformation also inspired others to take journeys of their own. More than anything, the knowledge that I’d gained over the years — starting with when I made my own transformation — allowed me to become a coach and author, helping first hundreds, and eventually thousands of people change their lives.</p> <p><b>Master of Two Worlds</b> &#8211; The last stage of the journey is when the Hero becomes the Master of Two Worlds &#8212; he is able to unite the light and dark within him. Metaphorically, this stage is about balance &#8212; about reconciling who you were with who you have become, and allowing yourself to accept both. For me, it was about mastering life in my new body &#8212; understanding all of the benefits it provided without going overboard in any direction. This was a continuation of the Road Back, and was about slowly moving away from the more extreme stuff and finding a way to live life and do things that normal people do, like go to dinners and have the occasional beer.</p> <p>I should mention that at the time I made my fitness transformation, I didn’t realize that I had been on what could be called a Hero’s Journey — my familiarity with Campbell was fresh, and I wasn’t able to see the parallels quite as clearly. It wasn’t until I began my business (Hero’s) Journey that I understood that Campbell could be applied to anything. From that point on, I began to incorporate some aspects of the monomythic structure into my client&#8217;s programs and my lessons with them; I found that teaching Campbell helps teach fitness information, or at least drive the point home. And it was from this general understanding that I wrote my book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089LOJYU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B0089LOJYU&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess-20" target="_blank"><i>Man 2.0: Engineering the Alpha</i></a>. And I used that platform — a book that become a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller — to show how to use the Hero’s Journey to get in the best shape of your life.</p> <h3><b>Outside the Gym: Other Examples, and How Campbell Affects You</b></h3> <p>Of course, a fitness journey is just a single example of how the monomyth can be applied to your life. Once you know the general structure, it’s not difficult to plot journeys in all aspects of life — everything from your decision to enroll in college to your romantic relationships.</p> <p>It has exceptional validity with regard to love, actually — just look at the standard plot outline of a romantic comedy: <i>boy meets girls, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back</i>, could just as easily be <em>boy hears the call to adventure, boy refuses call to adventure, boy goes on adventure anyway</em>. In either case, through the assistance of a mentor (could be a wise-cracking friend or parent figure), the Hero will go on a journey of introspection and come out on the other side worthy of the girl.</p> <p>A more detailed example might be that you get married, and settle into married life (Ordinary World). Your wife gets pregnant (Call to Adventure). You freak out at first (Refusal), but are obviously thrilled. Over the course of the pregnancy, appointments with your doctors (Meeting with the Mentor) help you and your wife (Allies) prepare (Approach) for the birth of the child (Threshold Crossing). Being a parent is now your main responsibility (Ordeal) and at the end of the quest there is your child &#8212; your legacy &#8212; who will carry on in the world after you’re gone (Return with Elixir).</p> <p>Want a professional example? How’s this: you lose your job (Call to Adventure), and although you feel its loss and want it back (Refusal of the Call), you eventually decide that you want to move on to a new career. This can go in any number of ways, let’s assume you seek the help of a business coach (Meeting with the Mentor). Eventually, you decide to start your own business, or start a blog — something you’ve never done before (Crossing the First Threshold). There are a lot of challenges along the way, as well as successes and failures (Tests, Allies, Enemies). Follow this path to its ultimate conclusion and you wind up creating something — income, a book, a product — (Reward) that betters you (Apotheosis) and allows you to better the world (Return with the Elixir).</p> <h3><b>Closing the Circle</b></h3> <p>While the strength of the monomyth is certainly due to its universal applicability, perhaps the greatest benefit comes <i>after</i> it’s been applied. <b>As I alluded to above, the act of change itself changes you.</b></p> <p>This principle is what allowed me to take the next step in my own journey and write <i>Engineering the Alpha</i> as a way to make the journey relevant to all men and help them see the path that could guide them to their biggest goals — whether physical, emotional, or social. The result has been a testing ground where thousands of men have been able to transform their lives in ways they never thought possible.</p> <p>And it’s all because of Campbell. Understanding the Hero’s Journey is comparable to the moment when Neo understands the Matrix. It allows you to comprehend what is happening and why, and exactly how you should respond and react to make the best decisions possible. Life slows down, and when that happens you can speed up and make better choices that ultimately lead to change.</p> <p>By going through a massive change, you will come to a greater understanding of yourself, and what you’re capable of. Success is a learned habit, and success begets success — the more positive changes you go through, the less resistant to change and growth you will be.</p> <p>All that’s left is one simple question: Are you ready to become the hero? If so, it’s time to recognize your ordinary world, begin the journey, and ultimately become a better man and the best version of you.</p> <p><em><strong>Where are you in the Hero&#8217;s Journey?

<p>This may not be fair to books, since paragraphs find their way to us through books, and they often gain their peculiar power because of the context they have in the book. But the point remains: One sentence or paragraph may lodge itself so powerfully in our mind that its effect is enormous when all else is forgotten.</p>

<p>It might be useful to illustrate this with two books by Jonathan Edwards that have influenced me most. Here are the key paragraphs and lessons from these books. Most of the rest of their content I have long forgotten (but who knows what remains in the subconscious and has profound impact?).</p>

<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/books/gods-passion-for-his-glory"><em>The End for Which God Created the World</em></a></strong></p>

<p>Outside the Bible this may be the most influential book I have ever read. Its influence was inseparable from its transposition into the syllabus on Unity of the Bible in a course by that name with Daniel Fuller in seminary. There are two massive truths that were settled for me. First:</p>

<blockquote><p>All that is ever spoken of in the Scripture as an ultimate end of God’s works is included in that one phrase, the glory of God. (Yale, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300040202">Vol. 8</a>, p. 526)</p></blockquote>

<p>The book was an avalanche of Scripture demonstrating one of the most influential convictions in my life: God does everything for his glory. Then came its life-changing corollary:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the creature’s knowing, esteeming, loving, rejoicing in, and praising God, the glory of God is both exhibited and acknowledged; his fullness is received and returned. Here is both an <em>emanation</em> and <em>remanation</em>. The refulgence shines upon and into the creature, and is reflected back to the luminary. The beams of glory come from God, and are something of God, and are refunded back again to their original. So that the whole is <em>of God</em>, and <em>in</em> God, and <em>to</em> God; and God is the beginning, middle and end in this affair. (Yale, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300040202">Vol. 8</a>, p. 531)</p></blockquote>

<p>To me this was simply beautiful. It was overwhelming as a picture of the greatness of God. The impact was heighted by the fact that the last line is a manifest echo of Romans 11:36: “From him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.”</p>

<p>But the central, life-shaping impact was the sentence: “In the creature’s knowing, esteeming, loving, rejoicing in, and praising God, the glory of God is both exhibited and acknowledged.” And even more specifically: “In the creature’s rejoicing in God, the glory of God is exhibited.” God’s glory is exhibited in my being happy in him. Or as Edwards says earlier: “The happiness of the creature consists in rejoicing in God, by which also God is magnified and exalted” (Yale, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300040202">Vol. 8</a>, p. 442.) If not being supremely happy in God means robbing him of his glory, everything changes.</p>

<p>That has been the unifying message of my life: <em>God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.</em></p>

<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1470179768"><em>The Freedom of the Will</em></a></strong></p>

<p>This was a breathtaking book. The scope and rigor of its argument made it one of the most demanding books I have ever read. David Wells calls it a watershed book: How you judge this argument decides where all waters of your life will flow. My judgment was: <em>irresistibly compelling</em>. Here’s the unforgettable summary sentence:</p>

<blockquote><p>God’s moral government over mankind, his treating them as moral agents, making them the objects of his commands, counsels, calls, warnings, expostulations, promises, threatenings, rewards and punishments, is not inconsistent with a determining disposal of all events, of every kind, throughout the universe, in his providence; either by positive efficiency, or permission. (Yale, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300158408">Vol. 1</a>, p. 431)</p></blockquote>

<p>God governs all events of every kind, including my acts of will, yet in such a way that I am still liable to rewards and punishments. His sovereignty and my accountability are compatible. The implications of this are vast.</p>

<p>One of the most important insights for me in working this out was Edwards’s distinction between <em>natural</em> inability to do something and <em>moral</em> inability to do something. Here’s the key paragraph:</p>

<blockquote><p>We are said to be <em>naturally</em> unable to do a thing, when we can’t do it if we will, because what is most commonly called nature don’t allow of it, or because of some impeding defect or obstacle that is extrinsic to the will; either in the faculty of understanding, constitution of body, or external objects. <em>Moral</em> inability consists not in any of these things; but either in the want of inclination; or the strength of a contrary inclination; or the want of sufficient motives in view, to induce and excite the act of the will, or the strength of apparent motives to the contrary. (Yale, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300158408">Vol. 1</a>, p. 159)</p></blockquote>

<p>If we are <em>naturally</em> unable to do something, we are not accountable to do it (like trying to get out of a chair if we truly want to but are chained in it), but if we are <em>morally</em> unable to do something, we are still accountable to do it (like trying to keep the law of God, though we can’t because we hate it). This insight was crucial in understanding Romans 8:7 (“the mind of the flesh <em>cannot</em> submit to God”), and 1 Corinthians 2:14 (“the natural man <em>cannot</em> understand the things of the Spirit”).</p>

<p>As I look back over my life and what I have been able to see and savor in God’s word, I give thanks for momentous sentences and paragraphs, and for the God-besotted people who wrote them. In this case, I thank God for Jonathan Edwards.</p>

<blockquote><p>He didn’t think children’s stories were beneath him. In fact, a mind like that is what it took to write those children’s stories. And of course, as Lewis said, a children’s story that’s only good for children isn’t a good children’s story in the least. He dignified children, and he knew the power of story. . . . The story is how you capture the child’s heart.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this second clip, Sally Lloyd-Jones talks about learning narration and tone from Lewis. He knew the best tone was like a mother talking to her children. His influence on her, she says, is like the air we breathe. “I can’t even tell you how influential he’s been. His words have been such a part of me.”</p>

It’s plain in the Bible and plain in our everyday experience as parents.</p>

<p>I have five children. The first three are girls; the last two are boys. They <em>are</em> different! There is no question that each child is unique. There is no question of the heterogeneity in temperament, interests, skills, gifts, weaknesses, areas of sin, areas of obedience, and more. Yes and amen. God is not in the business of creating a monolithic people. But from birth, the boys, as boys, were intrinsically different than the girls.</p>

<p>My husband and I parent on many levels. There are places where our parenting is the same across the board (no one is allowed to say “shut up” to anyone else). Then there are aspects which are dependent upon personality (the child’s personal strengths and weaknesses). And then there are areas which are dependent upon the specific sex (the boys can play dolls with their sisters, but they need to play roles as boys or men).</p>

<h4>Cultivating Identity</h4>

<p>The aim is to deliberately parent our children in such a way that reinforces their gender and gives them contentment in how God created them.</p>

<p>Now it does <em>not</em> mean we make shallow, meaningless rules like girls can’t climb trees or boys can’t play house. We are living every day in the thick of parenting girls <em>and</em> boys. Reinforcing their girlhood and boyhood is a heart issue. It is not necessarily <em>what</em> they are playing; it is what identity they are cultivating <em>in</em> the play.</p>

<h4>Helpers and Protectors</h4>

<p>Our kids’ play has proven to be a great opportunity to reinforce the beauty of God’s good gift of gender.</p>

<p>When my husband gets on the floor and pretends to be a dragon, he asks our oldest son to protect his sister. This is a way to train the boys to protect and guard. But he also turns it around so that sister can have a chance to defend herself and come to the rescue of her brother. You may wonder what the difference is. It’s subtle and inward. The difference is in the heart role we encourage them to take: When a sister is saving the brother and helping to kill the “dragon” (their daddy), <em>she is doing it from the intrinsic identity of helper.</em> She is helping her brother by coming to his rescue, and she is exercising dominion over the “wicked dragon” by slaying him. However, when a brother is coming to the rescue to save his sister, <em>he is doing so from the intrinsic identity of protector.</em></p>

<p>There are times when the <em>same</em> outward action is properly motivated by completely different inward thought and heart orientation. The brothers and sisters can both <em>do the same thing</em>, but do them from different motives and self-understanding. And teaching this is part of teaching gender identity to our children. This is part of what I mean when I say we reinforce who God created them to be. <em>It is about heart orientation</em> (see Proverbs 4:23; Matthew 7:21; 12:34).</p>

<h4>From Deep to Deep</h4>

<p>If we want boys and girls to be content in their gender — content in who God created them to be — the answer isn’t about what they can and can’t play with or whether or not they should get a different kind of education. It is heart training that will help our boys grow up to be men and our girls grow up to be women, both of which are two distinctly glorious realities in creation. Therefore, what this comes down to is a heart orientation that is intrinsically tied to each gender. Why? Because gender is an intrinsic, objective reality that comes from deep within our personhood. Gender, either masculine or feminine, is spiritual, psychological, physiological, and emotional. There is a feminine glory and a masculine glory — both God-made for his glory. It is this high aspiration that we want our children to increasingly grasp.</p>

<p>Therefore, training their heart to orient properly to the things around them will help them, by the grace of God, to understand the masculine and feminine qualities of creation, to understand their sexuality as adults, and seek a marriage union which is compatible spiritually, intellectually, and physically. It is a matter of the heart that will help them understand true equality before God and labor side-by-side with others and their spouses to bring the light of the gospel to those around them. Heart training is what equips them to identify and exercise vocation, value family life and children, and above all, follow robustly after Christ, their Creator and Redeemer.</p>

<h4>The Beautiful Genius of Creation</h4>

<p>Such heart training should not be heavy-handed. Our little boy doesn’t get scolded immediately for putting on his older sister’s high-heeled shoes. We aim to parent with grace and reasonableness. We gently guide that little toddler toward an appropriate pair of big shoes he can play with and take that opportunity to remind him that the other ones belong to his older sister.</p>

<p>Given the empirical evidence that faces me from sun-up to sun-down every day, there is no other logical and intellectually honest conclusion I can arrive at: <em>Boys and girls are different.</em> This intrinsic diversity, alongside its amazing harmony, is fundamental to the beautiful genius of God’s creation of his image-bearing human race. <em>Especially, in our age of gender confusion, we want to give special vigilance to our boys and girls understanding who God made them to be.</em></p>

<p>Our parenting, we hope, is neither stifling nor obtuse. Quite the opposite. Within the life-giving boundaries God has placed in creating girls and boys, our children can enjoy their gender and wield their identities for God’s glory and their everlasting joy.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DGBlog/~4/wN3HAa1zjUQ" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 00:00:00 -0500";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DGBlog/~3/wN3HAa1zjUQ/training-heart-identities-in-boys-and-girls";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"desiringgod.org-blog-post-5360";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0";a:1:{s:8:"origLink";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/training-heart-identities-in-boys-and-girls";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:19:"

<p>If glory includes beauty, as <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/how-pervasive-and-practical-is-the-beauty-of-god">I wrote last week</a>, it includes lines. They may be curved or straight. But without lines there is no form. You would never see a cloud, if there were no border to it. The whole sky would be one color. You would never see the sun or the moon or a baseball, if there were no circumference. Never see an oak leaf, if there were no fingered outline. Never see a human face, if the cheeks and nose and brow and chin had no edge.</p>

<p>Therefore the glory of Christ has lines. Without them, “glory” is just a word. These lines define forms of beauty. Aspects of glory. Particularities that can be seen and enjoyed. This is who Jesus is. He is not a vague glory. He is a glorious coherence of particular glories that have lines.</p>

<h4>More Than Vague Talk</h4>

<p>I was praying this morning for the church I served for 33 years. I said, “O God, grant that Pastor Jason and the staff and elders and people would live for the glory of Christ.” As I prayed this, I thought, “What do I mean?” And the truth pressed in on me: Vague talk about the glory of Christ often covers a mountain of vagueness and misrepresentation.</p>

<p>For example, one of our first visitors here in Tennessee, where we’re staying in a relative’s house for several months, was a 75-year-old Jehovah’s Witness with a five-year-old boy. I spoke with him for perhaps 20 minutes on the front porch. After I heard his analysis of the Syrian and Egyptian conflicts, I said, “One of the main problems I have with Jehovah’s Witness beliefs is that you diminish the glory of Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>He said, “Oh, no. We don’t do that. We look forward to the day when we will all live happily in the kingdom ruled by Jesus Christ. This will be very glorious, and he will be the most glorious one of all.”</p>

<p>I said, “But he will not be God.”</p>

<p>He said, “I know that’s the way you read the Bible, but we don’t think that’s what it teaches.”</p>

<p>I said, “But it does diminish the glory of Jesus Christ to deny that he is God and that all the fullness of deity dwells in him bodily. That is a diminishment of his glory.”</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “he will be very glorious.”</p>

<p>He let me pray for us that Christ would stand forth and reveal his true glory.</p>

<h4>Where the Lines Are Drawn</h4>

<p>So as I prayed this morning for my pastor and my church, I did not pray vaguely. When I said, “Grant them to live for the glory of Christ,” I saw lines. The glory of Jesus has lines, borders, edges, circumferences. He is one thing and not another. His “glory” is not a catchall for things we think are wonderful. The lines I saw were not the lines of the Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>

<p>Which leads us to the Bible. This is the place where the lines are drawn for us to see. Here in the Bible, Jesus has one kind of glory and not another. This is why we care so much, and write so much, about doctrinal particularities.</p>

<h4>Bringing Jesus into Focus</h4>

<p>Jesus is real. He is not a smudge of wonder. As you turn the lens of Scripture correctly, he comes into amazing focus, yes, even with our present limitations (1 Corinthians 13:12). We do not worship a formless glory.</p>

<p>So look for the lines, the form, the particularities of his person, his specific beauties.</p>

<p>I am praying that my pastor and the church I love would live for</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the glory of the Jesus who was in the beginning with God and was God (John 1:1).</p></li>
<li><p>the glory of the Jesus who shed his blood to seal the new covenant for his people (Luke 22:20).</p></li>
<li><p>the glory of the Jesus who said, “I lay down my life for the sheep” (John 10:15).</p></li>
<li><p>the glory of the Jesus who said, “No one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him” (Matthew 11:27).</p></li>
<li><p>the glory of the Jesus who said, “You do not believe because you are not among my sheep” (John 10:26).</p></li>
<li><p>the glory of the Jesus who said, “All that the Father gives me will come to me” (John 6:37).</p></li>
<li><p>the glory of the Jesus who said, “No one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father” (John 6:65).</p></li>
<li><p>The glory of the Jesus who wept over Jerusalem, saying, “Would that you had known the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes” (Luke 19:41–42).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So when you pray, and when you worship, remember there is no beauty without lines. And there are ways to draw the lines of glory that are not the glory of Christ. Know your Bible well. Trace its lines. And worship this Christ.</p>

Lewis. Many despise him for his Christianity and convictions. Many love him dearly for his brilliant mind and writing and prophetic insight.</p>

<p>If you’ve read enough Lewis to track with his vision and life’s project, you’ll either love him or hate him. Let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about being only a casual fan. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.</p>

<p>With the <a href="http://www.desiringGod.org/lewis">Desiring God 2013 National Conference</a> just around the corner — and the July 26 <a href="http://www.desiringGod.org">early-bird deadline for registration</a> approaching even faster — we sat down for a quick conservation about Lewis with Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary professor, and unapologetic Lewis-lover, Joe Rigney. Joe is scheduled to give a seminar at the conference on “Live Like a Narnian: Christian Discipleship in C.S. Lewis’s Chronicles,” as well as a 10-minute “small talk” on “Lewis Against the Hipsters (And Those Who Despise Them).”</p>

<p>The conversation is only seven-and-a-half minutes, but Joe can talk fast and get a lot in. He addresses Lewis’s amazing versatility as a writer of children’s books, science fiction, essays, sermons, apologetics, Medieval and Renaissance lit, and more. He also discusses Lewis’s prophetic gifting which makes him so relevant today, as well as how to prepare well for a conference like this on Lewis (with an important shortlist of Lewis books to commend).</p>

<p>You can listen in on this short conversation <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/interviews/c-s-lewis-christian-writer-scholar-prophet">at the resource page</a>, or <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/interviews/c-s-lewis-christian-writer-scholar-prophet">download here</a>.</p>

<p>You know what I mean. It’s that thing that’s weighing on you, which you know would honor God because it obeys his law of love (John 15:12), or is a work of faith (2 Thessalonians 1:11), or puts “to death the deeds of the body” (Romans 8:13). You know it would be good for your soul or body or family or vocation or neighbor or church.</p>

<p>But you don’t feel like doing it. You know that God promises you more blessing if you do it than if you don’t. But you’re struggling to believe it because it feels difficult. It’s like you have weights on your ankles. You don’t want to muster the energy, and every distraction glows with attraction.</p>

<h4>The Strange Pattern of Progress</h4>

<p>While it’s true that this is our indwelling sin of which we must repent and fight to lay aside (Hebrews 12:1), the experience of “not feeling like it” also can become for us a reminder of a gospel truth and actually give us hope and encouragement in this battle.</p>

<p>Think about this strange pattern that occurs over and over in just about every area of life:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Healthy, nutritious food often requires discipline to prepare and eat while junk food is convenient, tasty, and addictive.</p></li>
<li><p>Keeping the body healthy and strong requires frequent deliberate discomfort while it only takes constant comfort to go to pot.</p></li>
<li><p>You have to make yourself pick up that nourishing but intellectually challenging book while popping in a DVD is as easy and inviting as coasting downhill.</p></li>
<li><p>You frequently have to force yourself to get to devotions and prayer while sleeping in or reading the sports or checking Facebook is almost effortless.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning to skillfully play beautiful music requires thousands of hours of tedious practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Excelling in sports requires monotonous drills <em>ad nauseum</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning to write well requires writing, writing, writing and rewriting, rewriting, rewriting. And usually voluminous reading.</p></li>
<li><p>It takes years and years of schooling just to make certain vocational opportunities possible.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You get the idea. The pattern is this: the greater joys are obtained through struggle and difficulty and pain, while brief, unsatisfying, and often destructive joys are right at our fingertips. Why is this?</p>

<h4>Why the Struggle and Difficulty and Pain?</h4>

<p>Because God, in great mercy, is showing us everywhere, in things that are just shadows of heavenly realities, that there is a great reward for those who struggle through and persevere (Hebrews 10:32–35). He is reminding us almost everywhere to walk by faith in a promised future and not by the sight of immediate gratification (2 Corinthians 5:7).</p>

<p>Understood this way, each struggle becomes an invitation by God to follow in the faithful footsteps of his Son, “who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God” (Hebrews 12:2).</p>

<p>Those who are spiritually blind only see futility in these struggles. But for those who have eyes to see, God has woven hope (faith in his future grace) right into the futility of creation (Romans 8:20–21). Each struggle becomes a pointer saying, “Look ahead, past the struggle itself, past the temptation of the puny, vapor joys to the great, sustained, substantial Joy set before you!”</p>

<h4>Endurance, Not Indulgence</h4>

<p>So today, don’t let “not feeling like it” reign as lord (Romans 6:12). Rather, through it see your Father pointing you to the reward he has planned for all who endure to the end (Matthew 24:13). Let it remind you that his call is not to indulgence but endurance.</p>

<p>Then lay this weight aside and run with faith the race he has set before you.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>This light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.</em> (2 Corinthians 4:17–18)</p></blockquote>

<h4>Standing with the Disempowered</h4>

<p>Perhaps you think that I have a knack — call it a spiritual “gift” if you like — of affiliating with the losing team?</p>

<p>One of my enduring life values, which carried me through the Feminist and Gay Rights movements of the 1990s, and continues to motivate me today as one of Christ’s own, is the desire to stand with the disempowered. So here I am. Standing in a familiar place, bearing a new heart supplied by the Holy Spirit, a renewed mind, transformed by Christ’s atoning love, a new mission, created from before the foundation of the world by God’s sovereignty, and a new identity as a daughter of the King. But here I stand, still sporting my comfortable shoes.</p>

<h4>An Electric Few Weeks for a Former Lesbian</h4>

<p>This has been an electric few weeks for a former atheist, now Christian disciple. First, Exodus International closes down. Truth be told, this is fine by me. Reparative therapy was never part of God’s method, and Jesus Christ did not die to make any para-church his bride. But Exodus detonated with a colossal bang, and took with it gospel integrity, leaving even more theological turbulence in its wake.</p>

<p>Now the Supreme Court, using strong, cosmological, moral language defending the human dignity of same-sex unions, overturns DOMA and Proposition 8, sending a resounding rebuke to the Christian ideal of creation ordinance, and with it, the normative (albeit not always redeemed) heterosexuality that undergirds it.</p>

<h4>Gathering the Children in Close</h4>

<p>So I did what parents across the country did — believing parents and unbelieving parents, gay parents and heterosexual ones. I gathered my children in close, and I talked with them. You probably did this, too. No big surprises in my talk.</p>

<p>No new news. No identity bombs were dropped. My children have always known that their mother used to be an atheist and a lesbian. They cut their teeth on this vocabulary, and could say the words before they knew what they meant. Saved by grace. Closets are for clothes, after all.</p>

<p>Here is what I know: God is bigger than my sin. And God is sovereign over Supreme Court decisions and shifting worldviews. He has had the first and he will have the last word on all matters of sin and grace.</p>

<p>The Church, Christ’s bride, is a God-made institution and will sustain herself in majesty in times of persecution or revival. Context matters not. Providence will paint the walls of this worldview.</p>

<h4>Who Owns Your Heart</h4>

<p>But Jesus, the Word made flesh, will not be drawn and quartered. He came to fulfill the whole law, every jot and tittle. And he wants your whole life relinquished to him. Any theology that denies God’s moral law, and then domesticates sin by its absence, does not have Christ’s atoning love, God’s justifying pardon, or the Holy Spirit’s kind company. The Red Letters of the New Testament, unmoored from the moral law of the whole Bible, offer only half the God-man, mangling the gospel by wrenching salvation from sin and belief from repentance. Even the demons believed in Jesus — and it only sent them straight to hell. All dangerous lies pack a dollop of truth. That was true when Jesus walked the earth, and it is true today. That we are saved from our sin simply reveals the obvious: God was right all along. No shame in truth that loves like this.</p>

<p>The Bible is not some pragmatist’s paradigm. It is the double-edged sword that chiseled truth into my stony heart, rendering it new and with it, recreating me as a new creature in Christ, a daughter of the King. I have no personal sexual orientation to call my own after Christ chisels my heart anew — and neither do you. We have Christ orientation, an alien identity to which we claim no rights. Do we struggle with sin? Yes. Is temptation a sin? No. What distinguishes temptation from sin? Temptation clobbers you from the outside and lures you to do its bidding. Sin makes temptation a house pet, gets it a collar and leash, and is deceived to believe that it can be restrained by impositions of civility. What you do with temptation reveals Who owns your heart. How you talk about other people’s sin patterns reveals Who owns your heart.</p>

<h4>Lessons in Losing</h4>

<p>So, here is what I have learned from being on the losing team of both historic, public, and political renderings of homosexuality.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is a sin, but so is homophobia. Homophobia is irrational fear of a whole people group, failing to see in that group God’s image diminished but not extinguished by sin, and that God’s elect people linger there, snared by their own design and awaiting gospel grace. Biding time. Think about that. Waiting like the caterpillar that spawned today’s butterfly. God has set apart a people from before the foundation of the world to receive his grace, and they are waiting for you in every nation and people group. It is an act of homophobia to believe that people in the LGBT community are either too sinful to respond to God’s call on their life, or to believe that people in the LGBT community have a fixed nature that will never, by the blustering, unfounded, and uncharitable declarations of secular psychology, change by the power of the gospel.</p>

<p>The only fixed feature of the human constitution or badge of personal identity is the soul; imprint of God to us, it will journey from life to death to life and will last forever, permanently, for eternity in heaven or hell.</p>

<h4>Hopes, Dreams, Redemption</h4>

<p>The gospel reorders and remakes people, and its metamorphosis manifests in a life that loves God more than itself. God doesn’t zap us. He walks with us through the valley of the shadow of death, promising that as we “proclaim and initiate an irreconcilable war against our choice sins,” as Puritan William Gurnell states, God will be there. The Rock. Never leaving nor forsaking. Never failing the soul who puts trust in Him (Psalm 9:10). No matter what.</p>

<p>God promises that he will make meaning, purpose, and grace out of your redeemed life. God provides the church to be family, from cradle to grave, where single Christians are cherished saints in Christ’s Kingdom, not people waiting to be fixed. And God provides Christ-redeemed heterosexual marriage so that his creation ordinance is fulfilled and so that his Bride, the church, has imaginative authority over hopes and dreams.</p>

Tozer famously said that whatever comes to our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us. When you hear the mention of “God,” what would you say? What image fills your heart and head when you think about who God is?</p>

<p>The question is important because we all have some kind of answer. Everybody has a go-to thought when they think of God. And we want that picture to be true, that is, formed by what God says about himself, not the dictates of our experience.</p>

<p>Here’s an effort to get that picture right, as the Bible bears it out. Here are at least three things we should know about God.</p>

<h4>1. God Is Father.</h4>

<p>“The most foundational thing in God,” says Michael Reeves, “is not some abstract quality, but the fact that he is Father.” In his book <a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/delighting-in-the-trinity-michael-reeves-9780830839834?utm_source=desiringgod"><em>Delighting in the Trinity</em></a>, Reeves begins with this important, but all-too-frequently forgotten, fact that God really is Father, as Scripture attests and Christian theology demands.</p>

<p>Many of us, when put on the spot, probably think of God as Creator. We see him as strong and mighty and the cause of everything that exists. And this is true. But it doesn’t get at the heart of who God is.</p>

<p>Reeves makes this point masterfully in his first chapter titled, “What Was God Doing Before Creation?” If God were essentially <em>Creator</em>, it would mean he needs his <em>creation</em> to be who he is. The same goes for God as a Ruler, or a Judge. Each of these titles are accurate descriptions of God, but they fail to show us God in his essence. Each of them depends upon something else to be the case. We must ask who God is in himself. Who is God apart from anything else?</p>

<p>The answer is Father. The Bible tells us this (Isaiah 63:16; 64:8; Deuteronomy 32:6). And the biblical revelation of the Trinity begins to unfold its wonder. God doesn’t need anything but himself for this to be true. Before there was anything, there was God — the everlasting Father who eternally has loved his Son in the unceasing fellowship of the Spirit. This is who God is.</p>

<h4>2. God Is Happy.</h4>

<p>John Piper begins the first chapter of <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/books/the-pleasures-of-god"><em>The Pleasures of God</em></a> by citing an important phrase in 1 Timothy 1:11 — “the gospel of the glory of the blessed God.” Piper draws attention to the Greek word behind the English “blessed,” which is the same word for “happy.” The apostle Paul calls God the “happy God.”</p>

<p>So it’s not enough for us to think of God as Father. He is a happy Father.</p>

<p>When you think of God, do you think happy? Or do you think stern? Sadly, it is common for us to think of God as a negative caricature would depict him. Do you think of him frowning? Is he seething with anger like a capricious despot? Or do you see him who is glad at heart — glad in the glory of his Son and the communion that they share? Do we see him as the Father who said of Jesus, with no hesitation, “This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased” (Matthew 3:17)? Do we see him as the Father who delights to give us the kingdom (Luke 12:32)? Do we see him as the God who overflows with joy when a sinner repents (Luke 15:7)?</p>

<p>So long as sin exists, he feels indignation every day (Psalm 7:11). But at heart — who he is in himself — God is happy. To grasp this truth will work wonders in our souls.</p>

<h4>3. God Loves.</h4>

<p>God is a happy Father who eternally has loved his Son in the unceasing fellowship of the Spirit. This means that in his very nature, <em>God loves</em>. This doesn’t mean that God is never angry. He is angry, because of our sin and unrighteousness that rebelliously scoff at his love. God’s wrath is <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/theology-refresh/the-doctrine-of-the-wrath-of-god">a response to something external to himself</a>. In his nature, at his heart, God loves. Indeed, God is love (1 John 4:8).</p>

<p>“Before anything else,” Reeves explains, “for all eternity, this God was loving, giving life to and delighting in his Son” (26). And therefore, God is essentially outgoing. Like a fountain, as Jonathan Edwards would say, or like light (1 John 1:5). God, by his nature, shines. He essentially overflows. And so he created the world, in his pleasure, out of his abundant love, because that is who he is.</p>

<p>How could we not worship this God? How could we not heartily run to a God like this? Because sin corrupts the fellowship we were destined for. The fatherly love of God is a truth we are depraved enough to hate because it makes our hostility toward him irrational. If we were honest, in our darkness, we are much more comfortable with an angry, impersonal deity. But a God who is a happy Father who eternally loves with life-giving joy — it is hard to be mad at a God like that. It makes our rebellion feel senseless.</p>

<p>And senseless rebellion was our story — is our story — until the truth of the gospel breaks through. The Father sent the Son to live and die in our place, to suffer the wrath we deserve, that we might be welcomed into the loving fellowship of God. And this gospel came under no compulsion.</p>

<p>The gospel isn’t God’s attempt to balance the scales alongside his anger. Rather, the gospel reveals God’s very heart. God shows his love for us, Paul says, not after Jesus came and died, but in Jesus’s coming and dying (Romans 5:8), that we might be his sons and daughters who enjoy the eternal fellowship he has experienced with the Son by the Spirit for all eternity (John 17:24–26).</p>

<p>God — he is a happy Father who loves.</p>

Lewis and invites you to our National Conference on Lewis, September 27–29.</p>

<p>If your time is short, just go straight to the video. But if you wonder why we should even care about Lewis’s influence, you might want to read these few paragraphs.</p>

<p>C.S. Lewis’s profound influence on so many people was not owing to his aberrations from evangelical doctrine. Aberrations there were. But that was not the spring of his influence. It was in spite of that. So the quest to understand the depth and extent of his influence promises riches even for those of us who prize the doctrines where he was weakest.</p>

<p>Some people are influential because they attract attention with their avant-garde, unorthodox views. C.S. Lewis boasted of being an “intellectual dinosaur,” not avant-garde. Lewis was not at home in the modern world. He never learned to drive. He never learned to type. He rarely read newspapers. And his clothes were frumpy. The air he breathed was medieval. In other words, he was not influential because he was cool.</p>

<p>What was it?</p>

<p>And why would you want to know? I have an answer, but first a clarification. Don’t read Lewis mainly to figure out why he was influential. Read him for robust wisdom and virtuous pleasure. But after you have done that for thirty or forty years, you might want to ask, <em>Why was he so influential?</em></p>

<p>I want to know the keys to his influence because there is a difference between wanting fame and wanting influence. Christians should want to be influential. We should not want to be famous. Wanting fame means wanting to be known and praised by lots of people. Wanting to be influential means wanting lots of people to know and praise God because of how you spoke of him and lived before him.</p>

<p>It’s the difference between Matthew 6:1 and 5:16. To fame-seekers, Jesus says, “Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them” (Matthew 6:1). To influence-seekers, he says, “Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven” (Matthew 5:16).</p>

<p>I am looking forward to our National Conference on C.S. Lewis for lots of reasons. But one of them is to probe more deeply into why this man was so amazingly influential. And how might we be more influential for the glory of our Father because of what we learn?</p>

<p>This three-minute video is a beginning answer to the question about Lewis’s influence and an invitation to join us at the conference. I hope you enjoy the video and come to be with us in September.</p>

<p>Grab an iced tea, find some air-conditioned space, and put these ten passages to memory. You’ll never regret any extended time given to memorizing God’s word — especially when it’s the passages that come up again and again as particularly useful in the Christian life and in ministering to others.</p>

<p>These are ten that will prove especially useful for pastors and Christian leaders, but we think this is a good list for all Christians as well. See which ones you already know. Put a little polish on those, and perhaps tackle a new passage or few you don’t yet have to memory.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 23:1–6</strong></p>

<p>It’s one of the Bible’s best-known texts, and one of the most wonderful for steadying our own souls and others in the Good Shepherd (Psalm 23:1; John 10:11–18), in life’s best times and toughest.</p>

<p><strong>1 Corinthians 11:23–26</strong></p>

<p>However frequently our churches celebrate the Table (the more often, the merrier, it would seem), here’s the passage many pastors (should) recite in public more than any other. Speaking these “words of institution” with your eyes graciously scanning the congregation, rather than reading from a Bible or piece of paper, can make for a powerful moment in the life of the gathered church.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 28:18–20</strong></p>

<p>Hopefully the Great Commission is such an important text in focusing the mission and direction of our individual lives and especially our corporate life together, that you’d have this one ready to go at the drop of a hat. The generals and commanders should have this mission plan put to memory.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 46:1–11</strong></p>

<p>This psalm of confidence in God as our refuge and strength — a very present help in trouble — can be deeply comforting personally, but in particular in consoling others in the midst of life’s most difficult circumstances, whether it’s at the bedside, or in the hospital, or at the scene of the tragedy. When you’re called on unexpectedly to say a word of comfort about the nearness and unshakable strength of God, it’s hard to beat a gentle but confident reciting of Psalm 46, chased by a short prayer tailored to the trouble at hand.</p>

<p><strong>Colossians 1:15–20</strong></p>

<p>Any good shortlist of passages to memorize cold needs a good Christological anchor text, about Jesus’s objective work <em>for us</em> and <em>outside of us</em>. It’s easy to gravitate toward the more subjective texts that may feel more immediately applicable to our posture of heart and outward actions. But Christianity begins with Christ’s objective accomplishments, not the subjective application to us, essential as it is. And Colossians 1:15–20 may be the most power-packed six consecutive verses in the Bible for forming and shaping a distinctly Christian worldview. This is a potent little stick of dynamite to have hidden in your heart (along with Hebrews 1:1–4 and Philippians 2:5–11).</p>

<p><strong>Philippians 3:7–11</strong></p>

<p>Here’s the good-as-it-gets subjective passage to complement the great objective accomplishments in Colossians 1:15–20. This is where we want to live daily, and lead those who are following us, “count[ing] everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.” Even though the world, the flesh, and the devil almost constantly keep us from extended experiences of what Paul describes here, we love our tiny tastes and glimpses — and desperately want to keep realigning and recalibrating our heart-life, and our church, with this emotional North Star.</p>

<p><strong>Galatians 5:22–23</strong></p>

<p>Many of us have discovered that the longer we live the Christian life, the more admired and appreciated is the fruit of the Spirit at the end of Galatians 5. It’s a seriously profound list. The more and more our life is genuinely characterized by the virtues here, the more and more we are learning to live by the Spirit, in the kind of trust and reliance that makes our everyday lives surprisingly supernatural to the patterns of this age.</p>

<p><strong>Romans 8:28–39</strong></p>

<p>Okay, so just memorize the whole of Romans 8. Some have called it the most important chapter in the Bible. It very well may be that. Perhaps resolve with some ministry partner to tackle the chapter together, five verses each week, for two months. Meet weekly to stay accountable and recite the chapter as far as you’ve learned it so far, for some listening ears other than your own. But if making that kind of commitment is too much in this season of ministry, at least try to button down the final dozen verses. These are the biblical Himalayas. And they are omni-relevant in the Christian life and in ministry.</p>

<p><strong>Numbers 6:24–26</strong></p>

<p>This is the so-called “Aaronic Blessing” of the old covenant. God instructed Aaron (Moses’s brother and Israel’s first high priest), and his sons after him, to bless the people in this way. The threefold repetition of “Lord” rings of our Trinitarian Sovereign, and the use of this particular name makes it easily transferable to new-covenant Christians with the sovereign Christ as our “Lord.” A clear, well-paced and pastoral reciting of this blessing makes for a beautiful benediction for weekend corporate worship, or for a wedding or funeral, or for putting the kids or grandkids to bed.</p>

<p><strong>Jude 24–25</strong></p>

<p>These concluding verses from the short little missive by Jesus’s half-brother Jude also make for a wonderful doxology in ending a service or speaking a goodnight blessing. Or for asking God’s blessing on some new ministry endeavor. And so we end with Jude’s words as a prayer for any fresh initiatives God is calling us to in Scripture memorization…</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy, to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.</em></p></blockquote>

Of course, it can’t be precious if it’s not true. So that’s the biggest reason we embrace it. But let’s start with a definition:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Unconditional election is God’s free choice before creation, not based on foreseen faith, to which traitors he will grant faith and repentance, pardoning them, and adopting them into his everlasting family of joy.</em></p></blockquote>

<h4>1. We embrace unconditional election because it is true.</h4>

<p>All my objections to unconditional election collapsed when I could no longer explain away Romans 9. The chapter begins with Paul’s readiness to be cursed and cut off from Christ for his unbelieving Jewish kinsmen (verse 3). This implies that some Jews are perishing. And that raises the question of God’s promise to the Jews. Had it failed? Paul answers, “It is not as though the word of God has failed” (verse 6). Why not?</p>

<p>Because “not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel” (verse 6). In other words, God’s purpose was not to acquit every individual person in Israel. It was instead a purpose of election.</p>

<p>So to illustrate the point of God’s unconditional election, Paul uses the analogy of Jacob and Esau: “Though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad — in order that God’s <em>purpose of election</em> might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls — [Rebekah] was told, ‘The older will serve the younger’” (verses 11–12).</p>

<p>In other words, God’s original purpose in choosing individuals for himself out of Israel — and all the nations! (Revelation 5:9) — was not based on any conditions that they would meet. It was an unconditional election. And thus he says, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion” (verse 15; see verses 16–18; Romans 11:5–7).</p>

<p>Jesus confirms this teaching: “All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out” (John 6:37). Coming to Jesus is not a condition we meet to qualify for election. It is the result of election. The Father has chosen his sheep. They are his. And he gives them to the Son. That is why they come. “No one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father” (John 6:65). “You did not choose me, but I chose you” (John 15:16; see John 17:2, 6, 9; Galatians 1:15).</p>

<p>In the book of Acts, why did some believe and not others? Luke’s answer is election: “As many as were appointed to eternal life believed” (Acts 13:48). This “appointment” — this election—was not <em>based on</em> foreseen faith; it was the <em>cause</em> of faith.</p>

<p>In Ephesians 1. Paul says, “[God] chose us in [Christ] before the foundation of the world. . . . In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will” (Ephesians 1:4, 11). It is the “counsel of God’s will” that is eternally decisive in this affair.</p>

<p>What will <em>you</em> say to God at the judgment if he asks, “Why did you believe on my Son while others didn’t?” You will not say, “Because I was smarter.” No. Surely you will say, “Because of your grace. Had you not chosen me, I would have been left spiritually dead, unresponsive, guilty.”</p>

<h4>2. We embrace unconditional election because God designed it to make us fearless in our proclamation of his grace in a hostile world.</h4>

<p>“If God is for us, who can be against us? . . . Who shall bring any charge against <em>God’s elect</em>?” (Romans 8:31, 33).</p>

<h4>3. We embrace unconditional election because God designed it to make us humble.</h4>

<p>“God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise . . . so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. . . . Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord” (1 Corinthians 1:27, 29, 31).</p>

<h4>4. We embrace unconditional election because God made it a powerful moral impetus for compassion, kindness, and forgiveness.</h4>

<p>“Put on then, as God’s <em>chosen ones</em>, holy and loved, compassionate hearts, kindness . . . forgiving each other” (Colossians 3:12–13). No one has seen or savored his election truly who is not moved by it to become kind and patient and forgiving.</p>

<h4>5. We embrace unconditional election because it is a powerful incentive in our evangelism to help unbelievers, who are great sinners, not despair.</h4>

<p>When you offer Christ freely to all unbelievers, suppose one says, “I have sinned too terribly. God could never choose to save me.” The most ultimate despair-destroying thing you can say is this: Do you realize that God chose before the foundation of the world whom he will save? And he did it based on absolutely nothing in you. Before you were born or had done anything good or bad, God chose whether to save you or not.</p>

<p>Therefore, you dare not get in God’s face and tell him what qualifications you lack in order to be chosen. There were no qualifications for being chosen. “What then should I do?” he asks. “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved” (Acts 16:31). That’s how you begin to “confirm your calling and election” (2 Peter 1:10). If you will embrace the Savior, you will confirm that you are elect, and you will be saved.</p>

<p>In a new eight-hour course on Calvinism, or “the doctrines of grace,” John Piper walks through the historical “five points,” digging into text after text of Scripture and responding to many of the most common questions.</p>

<p>“The doctrines of grace,” Piper explains, “give the lowest view of the saved person as utterly depraved and hopeless in himself, and the highest view of the saved person as individually chosen and loved and purchased at infinite cost.”</p>

<p>These truths expose our desperate neediness, such that the subtlest form of boasting in ourselves becomes ridiculous. And at the same time, they highlight the grace of God such that we marvel with the apostle Paul, “To him be glory forever” (Romans 11:36).</p>

Your greatest wounds may be tied to unrealized dreams or unexpected disappointments. Unfortunately, the daily and worldly hopes we know in this life create some category confusion when it comes to our hope in Christ.</p>

<p>Peter’s first letter is written to Christians in conflict. Since following Jesus, they have not found the peace or safety or prosperity or relief that they might have expected. This world and their lives continue to be marred by inconvenience, disease, disappointment, persecution and even death.</p>

<p>They’re experiencing trials of every kind (1 Peter 1:6). Some are enduring sorrow, while suffering unjustly (2:19). They are receiving evil, being reviled (3:9) and slandered (3:16). They were maligned (4:4) and insulted (4:14). And these sufferings were common “throughout the world” (5:9). There’s suffering on every page of the book, and that is the scary, uncertain, painful context into which Peter speaks hope.</p>

<h4>Hope for the Heartbreaks</h4>

<p>As a follower of Christ, this life will not be easy or comfortable, but it will be real and full and lasting. Jesus says follow me and you will find inexpressible and glorious joy despite <em>and even in</em> really hard, bitter, heart-breaking, even excruciating moments and realities in your life.</p>

<p>The letter begins, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God’s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time” (1 Peter 1:3–5).</p>

<p>The first note Peter strikes is one of praise. Blessed be the life-giving, death-defying, overpowering God of absolutely miraculous mercy. If you believe and follow Jesus, you <em>will</em> face really difficult — maybe even <em>more</em> difficult — things in this life, but the God who raises the dead is <em>your</em> God and he’s with you. God has given you a new, true, full life through his Son, Jesus. And the life he gives is filled with an unconquerable, unquenchable hope.</p>

<h4>A Hope That Always Comes True</h4>

<p>God has caused us to be born again to a living hope, a hope which Peter makes deliberately distinct from a lot of the other hopes we’ve known. We hope all the time, and we’re often disappointed. <em>I hope I get an A on that test. I hope they hire me. I hope she says yes. I hope we can get a new car. I hope he remembers our anniversary.</em> Our hopes don’t always come true.</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> the kind of hope we have in God. Our hope in God is unlike any we’ve ever had, and that is because there is a moment in history that sets this hope apart from any other.</p>

<p>Peter writes, “…he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead…” The tomb could not hold the living, breathing, scarred, but victorious body of our Jesus. The man who claimed to be God, who committed no sin (2:22), and who died before hostile crowds, appeared <em>again</em>, just days later, before crowds bearing the wounds of the cross, but demonstrating a power and victory over it. He is <em>alive</em>.</p>

<p>And here in verse 3, Peter connects <em>this</em> life, the God-man’s life after death, witnessed by hundreds, celebrated at Easter, with <em>your</em> hope. Believer, if Jesus lives, you will live. God established and secured your hope when he raised his Son. Therefore, your hope is as alive as Jesus.</p>

<h4>A Test You Can Trust</h4>

<p>You’re going to be tempted to assess God’s faithfulness to deliver you by your circumstance, but the <em>better</em> test is the man standing beside the rolled away boulder, a place where angels say, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? …Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen.”</p>

<p>When everyone who had followed Jesus watched him suffer and die, they thought their hope had been crucified with him. But our hope did not die at Calvary. No, at the darkest moment of all, when defeat seemed certain, God was sealing our hope, enthroning it for all eternity in his Son.</p>

<p>As painful and heartbreaking as some of our days have been and will be, none will come close to the day we crucified the Lord. And yet even in <em>that</em> scene, God was big and strong and wise and merciful and present — he was there — bringing about his plan to save us and secure our hope forever.</p>

<h4>When Our Flesh Fails, We Won’t</h4>

<p>So when our flesh finally succumbs to death, when our body ultimately fails us by whatever means and at whatever age, the living Jesus assures us that we <em>will</em> live — and that we’ll live like never before. Our lives then and there with Jesus will be more full, more glorious — <em>complete</em>.</p>

<p>When life gives you pause about God’s goodness and faithfulness — when people fail and hurt you, when work oppresses you, when finances plague you, when you are rejected or offended because of your faith, when tornadoes tear through a town… more than once — we have a picture, <em>better</em>, a person, a living Jesus, who can still our hearts and instill trust and courage where fear, and doubt, and confusion have crept in. As long as Jesus lives — and he will never die again — and our hope is in him, our hope lives with him.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DGBlog/~4/SfB1lQqcnU0" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 08 Jul 2013 00:00:00 -0500";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DGBlog/~3/SfB1lQqcnU0/your-hope-is-as-alive-as-jesus";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"desiringgod.org-blog-post-5334";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0";a:1:{s:8:"origLink";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/your-hope-is-as-alive-as-jesus";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:19:"

There is “great sin” (Genesis 20:9), but never “glorious sin.” The evil one has “cosmic power” (Ephesians 6:12), but not cosmic “glory.” The reason for this is that sin and evil are not beautiful. But glory includes beauty. Glory includes more, but never less. Nothing ugly is glorious.</p>

<p>Therefore, the beauty of God is as pervasive and practical as the glory of God. If we admire the glory of God, we are admiring God’s beauty. If the glory of God has an effect in our lives, God’s beauty is having an effect. If God acts to magnify this glory, he is acting to magnify his beauty.</p>

<p>So consider the pervasive and practical place of beauty in all things.</p>

<h4>The Trinity</h4>

<p>In the eternal fellowship of the Trinity, the Son “is the radiance of the glory of God” (Hebrews 1:3). He is the image of God’s glory (2 Corinthians 4:4; Colossians 1:15). God the Father looks upon the beauty of the Son and loves him. “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased” (Matthew 3:17). Beauty belongs to the nature of God’s triune being.</p>

<h4>Creation</h4>

<p>God created the world to put his beauty on display. “The heavens declare the glory of God” (Psalm 19:1). When God created the glory of light, he prefigured what he would do in the new creation of human hearts. “God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ” (2 Corinthians 4:6). In the new creation, we see the beauty of God in the face of Christ. In the old creation, we see the beauty of God in the heavens and the earth.</p>

<h4>Fall and Sin</h4>

<p>The worst thing about the fall was the eclipsing of God’s beauty in the hearts of sinners. “Your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you” (Isaiah 59:2). This is the greatest loss in the fall of man. “Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images” (Romans 1:22–23). At the root of sin is blindness to God’s beauty.</p>

<h4>Incarnation</h4>

<p>The Son of God became man to make the beauty of God visible as never before. “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father” (John 1:14). By the work of the Holy Spirit, the inspired record of this incarnate Christ makes it possible for all of us (who weren’t there) to see his beauty. As the Spirit illumines the Scriptures, we see “the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ” (2 Corinthians 4:6).</p>

<h4>Conversion and Salvation</h4>

<p>The miracle that creates the sight of Christ’s beauty is the new birth — the new creation. It happens by God’s sovereign power, as in the first creation: “For God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ” (2 Corinthians 4:6). To be converted is to see Christ crucified for sinners as compellingly and satisfyingly beautiful. Jonathan Edwards calls this vision “happifying” (“The Pure in Heart Blessed,” Works, Yale. Vol. 17, p. 59ff).</p>

<p>Salvation is the transforming experience of the gracious radiance of the face of God. “Restore us, O God; let your face shine, that we may be saved!” (Psalm 80:3). “Blessed are the people who walk, O LORD, in the light of your face” (Psalm 89:15).</p>

<h4>Sanctification</h4>

<p>We are progressively made more like Christ by seeing and savoring his beauty. “We all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another” (2 Corinthians 3:18). The more you behold beauty, the more you become beautiful. This is why Paul said, “Whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things” (Philippians 4:8).</p>

<h4>Worship</h4>

<p>The Lord reveals his beauty for our worship “by the word of the Lord” (1 Samuel 3:21). And the heart of worship is gazing on that revelation, feeling its worth, and expressing our wonder. “One thing have I asked of the LORD, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to inquire in his temple” (Psalm 27:4).</p>

<h4>Consummation</h4>

<p>The final blessedness of God’s people will be the beauty of his manifest presence. “Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory” (John 17:24). “Now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face” (1 Corinthians 13:12). “They will see his face” (Revelation 22:4). “We know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is” (1 John 3:2).</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>From eternity to eternity, the beauty of God is pervasive and practical. Ask him to open the eyes of your heart (Ephesians 1:18). Give your life to this quest — seeing and savoring more and more of the happifying beauty of God.</p>

It’s no frills. It’s a very simple model of planting, and challenges many of the prevailing notions about starting a new church.</p>

<p>You’d never have guessed that an academic dean and professor of Hebrew from a major seminary was behind it.</p>

<p>Miles Van Pelt has been in Jackson, Mississippi, for a decade. He teaches full-time at Reformed Theological Seminary. Over time, he and his family saw a need around them — people they knew who seemed interested in Jesus but were misfits with the local churches around them. From this need, a call emerged. While Miles still teaches full-time, he and his family now help in leading a church-planting team in a very simple start-up model.</p>

<p>The model? They show up on Sunday, preach the gospel, eat together, and try to get to know the people during the week and disciple them in specific gospel applications. They launched with no fundraising push or financial affiliations or denominational support. This is low-bar and no frills.</p>

<p>It’s not comfortable, and it’s not for everyone. But Miles and his family of six love it.</p>

<p>In this new episode of Theology Refresh, the Hebrew prof talks about his unusually simple model of church planting, and how it has served his family’s calling to their community in Jackson, as well as created avenues and opportunities for ministering together as a family like never before.</p>

One moment we can speak glorious truth and the next moment destructive, satanic words. We must be on our guard, something Peter learned the hard way. The following meditation is from Matthew 16:13–27.</p>

<hr />

<p>Why Jesus had led his disciples up to Caesarea Philippi, they weren’t sure. At the foot of Mount Hermon, in the far north of Palestine, the population was mostly pagan. Legend told that the Greek god, Pan, had been born in a nearby cave housing a great spring of water. Temples and shrines were built into the cliffs. Philip the Tetrarch made the city his capital, which he named in honor of Tiberius Caesar — and himself.</p>

<p>But for Jesus, Caesarea Philippi was likely a refuge from the pressing crowds and controversy he generated among the Jews, a peaceful retreat where he could ask his disciples a defining question.</p>

<p>“Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”</p>

<p>“John the Baptist,” answered one. There were a few muted laughs because John had only died a few months ago. But the strange rumor made Philip’s half brother, Antipas, tremble.</p>

<p>Another said, “Some say Elijah.” This made more sense, since the prophet, Malachi, had said Elijah would come (Malachi 4:5). But in that sense, Elijah had died a few months ago.</p>

<p>“Or one of the other prophets, like Jeremiah,” said a third.</p>

<p>Jesus seemed to be lost in thought for a few minutes. Then he looked around the group and asked, “But who do you say that I am?”</p>

<p>This question pierced right to their deepest hope. It was a hope their ancestors had nurtured for centuries — one that had been dashed many times. It was a hope so dear that, even after all of Jesus’s signs, most were hesitant to actually say it.</p>

<p>But not Peter. For right or wrong, he was bolder than the rest. “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,” he answered with characteristic passion. The words echoed off the rocky walls. Every man felt his diaphragm tighten. This was the moment of truth. Their hopes rested on Jesus’s response.</p>

<p>“Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.”</p>

<p>Awe permeated this holy moment. Before this Jesus had all but proclaimed himself the Messiah. But now the line had been officially crossed. Peter had said what they all desperately hoped was true. And Jesus had affirmed it.</p>

<p>And in that moment, Peter earned his name. From then on he was a memorial stone of the mammoth, Mount-Hermon-like truth of Jesus’s person and his mission — the indestructible truth on which the church would be built.</p>

<p>But then irony struck. The rock of truth quickly became a stumbling block.</p>

<p>Having declared himself the Messiah to his disciples, Jesus immediately began explaining to them that his mission required his capture, death, and resurrection. This did not land on them as good news. How in the world could the messianic kingdom be established if the Messiah dies?</p>

<p>This really disturbed Peter. It wasn’t like Jesus to sound so resigned to being overcome by evil. There was no way that God would allow his Son to be killed and leave all the prophecies unfulfilled. Hadn’t they experienced God’s omnipotent power? And if it was a matter of protection, well, Jesus needed to know that no one would lay a hand on him, except over Peter’s dead body!</p>

<p>So at the next opportunity, bold Peter took Jesus aside and said, “Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you.”</p>

<p>Jesus cut him off with intense authority. “Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”</p>

<p>Peter stepped back, confused. This was the last thing he expected to hear. <em>Satan?</em> He was being used by Satan? And he thought he was trying to help.</p>

<hr />

<p>Peter might have recalled this moment later in life when he wrote this exhortation: “Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. Resist him” (1 Peter 5:8–9).</p>

<p>As Christians who have received the Holy Spirit, some of the most glorious truths that exist are revealed to us and pass through our lips. Yet we still must watch our mouths (Psalm 141:3), not only to refrain from harsh words of impatient irritability or selfish ambition, but also, as in Peter’s case, to keep ourselves and others from our sincerely held misunderstandings. Satan is very subtle. He is very good at deceiving us where our understanding is limited or partial. If we are not careful, we can be fully convinced that we are advancing God’s kingdom when we are really opposing it.</p>

<p>This is why it is so important that we be “quick to hear, slow to speak” (James 1:19) and clothed with humility, because, as Peter both experienced and wrote, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble” (1 Peter 5:5).</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DGBlog/~4/hVyIzIsgymQ" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 05 Jul 2013 00:00:00 -0500";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DGBlog/~3/hVyIzIsgymQ/watch-your-mouth";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"desiringgod.org-blog-post-5351";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0";a:1:{s:8:"origLink";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/watch-your-mouth";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:19:"

<p>For many, the Fourth of July means parades and picnics, hot dogs and Coca-Cola, ice cream and apple pie, baseball and bombs bursting in air. In God’s good providence, the adoption of Jefferson’s Declaration in 1776 happened during one of the best weather weeks of the year in this hemisphere. And so for 237 years now, the significance and seasonal timing of the day have conspired to make it a deeply rooted annual occasion in the American psyche.</p>

<p>While the Fourth’s flood of Americana is all-too-enticing for many, it can rub many others the wrong way. But before thumbing our noses or diving in deep, it’s good to pause to ask whether there’s anything that makes the day different for an American follower of Jesus. Does being born again affect how we view the Fourth of July? Here are four layers of perspective for the Christian in contemplating the Fourth specifically, and human government in general.</p>

<h4>Where Our Fundamental Identity Lies</h4>

<p>First, let’s be clear about where the Christian’s deepest identity lies. If we are in Christ, joined to him by faith, all other pledges of allegiance have been relativized, whatever our nation of origin or naturalization. We still have our loyalties — they may even multiply — but none goes this deep. No man can ultimately serve both God and country. In Jesus, we have one final allegiance, and thus in this world we will always be, in some real sense, pilgrims, strangers and aliens, sojourners and exiles (1 Peter 2:11).</p>

<p>For the Christian, our citizenship in any nation aims to be “worthy of the gospel of Christ” (Philippians 1:27), not merely worthy of that political state. At the most basic level, “our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,” who will do for us what no political entity in this world will ever do — “transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself”(Philippians 3:20–21).</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we are sons of God, not sons of Uncle Sam. The kings of the earth tax others, not their own sons (Matthew 17:25–26). Let your annual submission to the IRS be a friendly reminder that our fundamental identity is in God, not country.</p>

<p>Which means that as we Americans sing the anthem together and pledge allegiance side by side, and enjoy the parades and fireworks shoulder to shoulder, we create and strengthen ties that only go so far. The blood of Jesus runs deeper than the blood that flows in defining or defending any nation. Our fellows in political liberty are important, but not as significant as our fellows in Jesus from every tribe and tongue. Yes, we seek to do good to our fellow Americans, but especially to those who are of the worldwide household of faith (Galatians 6:10).</p>

<h4>Embracing God’s Goodness in the Fatherland</h4>

<p>Second, though our embrace of fatherland is relativized by our embrace of Jesus and his Father, it is good and healthy to have real affection for the nation we call our own. It is right for the Christian to be patriotic and reserve a special kind of love for city and country. In fact, it’s a sign that something may be amiss spiritually if the Christian doesn’t have some tempered but tangible sense of belonging to his fatherland. It’s not only okay for American Christians to enjoy being American on the Fourth; it’s commended.</p>

<p>God means for us to be appropriately enmeshed in this world (as Jesus prays in John 17, <em>not of the world, but</em> <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/let-s-revise-the-popular-phrase-in-but-not-of"><em>sent into it</em></a>). Christ and country aren’t irreconcilable. In Jesus’s perfect arithmetic, there is space not only to render God our everything, but render to Caesar his share as well (Matthew 22:21–22).</p>

<p>Christians render respect to whom respect is owed, and honor to whom honor is owed (Romans 13:7). We acknowledge God’s common goodness when our nation is manifestly “God’s servant for your good” (Romans 13:4) and the authorities are “ministers of God” (Romans 13:6). “Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor” (1 Peter 2:17).</p>

<h4>Genuine Gratitude for the Goodness</h4>

<p>Third, it follows that as God’s common goodness is manifested in our political state, we should be genuinely grateful. We give thanks when thanks is owed.</p>

<p>Perhaps we <a href="http://www.worldmag.com/2012/07/thankful_and_humble_to_be_an_american">balk at being “proud to be an American”</a> — and would prefer to be “humbled” by it. That’s wise and good. And we need not make any such alteration to the call to be thankful.</p>

<p>Given the fallen condition of our world because of human sin, we should be amazed how much common goodness God continues to create and uphold in nations good and even bad. In the same breath Paul instructs Christians to be good citizens — “to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all people” (Titus 3:1–2) — he also reminds us about our native condition:</p>

<blockquote><p>For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another. But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy . . . . (Titus 3:3–5)</p></blockquote>

<p>Given our depravity, and the diabolical desires that have a foothold in humanity for now, it is extraordinary mercy not only that any are saved at all, but also that any of our nations aren’t in worse shape than they are. We betray the far-reaching effects of God’s kindness when we’re so consumed with frustrations about our homeland that we can’t see many good things to be grateful for.</p>

<h4>Taking Others to the True Country</h4>

<p>Finally, for now, it continues to be legal to speak the gospel in public in these united states, and even to press for repentance and faith. This is a glorious liberty. Let’s make the most of it while we can, remembering that we Christians have a true country, which will satisfy our inconsolable longing like no nation in the present can. And let’s double our joy by bringing as many others with us as we can. It’s hard to say it any better than C.S. Lewis:</p>

<blockquote><p>If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world. If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing. If that is so, I must take care, on the one hand, never to despise, or to be unthankful for, these earthly blessings, and on the other, never to mistake them for the something else of which they are only a kind of copy, or echo, or mirage.</p>

<p>I must keep alive in myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find till after death; I must never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make it the main object of life to press on to that country and to help others to do the same. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061350214?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=desigod-20"><em>Mere Christianity</em></a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>If such a perspective would fly as the star-spangled banner over our Independence Day celebrations with family and friends, we might find them richer than ever.</p>

<p>Let’s be profoundly grateful for the freedom we have in this country to recruit for the true one, and let’s be unashamed to seize upon our fellow Americans’ desire for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and show them in whom such joy is truly found.</p>

<p>John would preach at the church on a Sunday morning only one time — on New Year’s Eve, 1972. At the time, he was a doctoral student in New Testament at the University of Munich, Germany, home for the holidays and to share the joy of their first son with family.</p>

<p>What remains from the sermon on suffering — <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/sermons/your-calamity-in-1973">“Your Calamity in 1973”</a> — are handwritten sermon notes, now transcribed and added to the DG resource library, making it the second oldest sermon in the archive.</p>

<p>“When I think about what to pray for, or resolve, in 1973,” he says in the sermon, “I can’t bring myself to ask for a placid life with no ripples or whirlpools. I don't know if God’s will for me is ease and smoothness. But this I do know: it is God’s will that every one of his people in 1973 rely on him more fully, delight in him more intensely, praise him with greater zest and deeper steadfastness, and all of this in the midst of our calamities in 1973, so that thereby the grace and power of our Lord Jesus Christ will be manifest to the world.”</p>

<p>The sermon on calamity proved to be a personal preparation for John and the Piper family. In attendance was his mother, Ruth Piper. Within two years after this sermon on suffering, on December 16, 1974, she would be tragically killed in a highway bus accident at the age of 56. This was the last sermon she would hear from her son.</p>

He expressed it like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many [distort the doctrine of justification by faith] when addressing children, and I notice that they generally speak to little ones about <em>loving</em> Jesus, and not upon believing him. This must leave a mischievous impression upon youthful minds and take them off from the true way of peace. (<em>Lectures to My Students</em>, Vol. 2, 1889, p. 270)</p></blockquote>

<p>It is a legitimate concern. <em>Trust</em> is more concretely demonstrable for children than <em>love</em>. A little child can be told to jump from the fourth step and daddy will catch him. “Trust me. I will catch you.” They can grasp that at two years old.</p>

<p>Similarly, a small child can grasp the application to Jesus: He will always be there to take care of you. In fact, he died once, to save and protect you. You will understand that more someday.</p>

<p>But what it means to <em>love Jesus</em> is not so easily demonstrable. Loving Jesus is more emotionally complex. It includes perceiving the qualities that make Jesus a beautiful and excellent person, worthy of our highest admiration. It involves treasuring Jesus for perfections that set him off from all others. This is not as easy for a child to grasp.</p>

<h4>Love in the Trust</h4>

<p>Emphasizing a child’s duty to love Jesus more than emphasizing the need to trust him may cause a distortion of love into a set of deeds. Children are wired to translate all perceived duties into deeds.</p>

<p>But that is not what love is. It is before and beneath deeds. When Jesus said, “If you love me, you will keep my commandments” (John 14:15), he meant that love precedes and enables obedience, not that love <em>is</em> obedience.</p>

<p>On the other hand, sooner or later, we will need to help our children realize that saving trust in Jesus has love for Jesus in it. And true love for Jesus has trust in Jesus in it.</p>

<p>Saving trust in Jesus banks on the truth that Christ died for us in order to make himself the eternal, all-satisfying treasure of our lives. The gospel is the “gospel of the glory of Christ” (2 Corinthians 4:4). He prayed for us: “Father . . . may they be with me where I am, to see my glory” (John 17:24).</p>

<p>Since the work of Jesus was done to give us <em>himself</em> to <em>love</em> forever, we cannot say we <em>trust</em> in him to do his work for us, while not treasuring the gift that he died to give — himself.</p>

<p>And <em>loving</em> Jesus always includes <em>trusting</em> Jesus to achieve all he said he would, because one of the things we love about him is his trustworthiness and his perfect mercy and justice shown best in the cross.</p>

<h4>The Necessity of Love</h4>

<p>So sooner or later we will introduce our children not only to the necessity of trusting Jesus (“Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved,” Acts 16:31), but of loving him.</p>

<p>We will discuss with them texts like this: “[People] are perishing, because they refused to <em>love</em> the truth and so be saved. . . . [Those will be] condemned who did not <em>believe</em> the truth but <em>had pleasure</em> in unrighteousness.” (2 Thessalonians 2:9–12). We will show them that “<em>loving</em> the truth” is not just <em>believing</em> that it is so, but “<em>having pleasure</em>” in it. And that means in <em>him</em> — The Truth.</p>

<p>We will read to them with great seriousness the warning, “If anyone has no <em>love</em> for the Lord, let him be accursed” (1 Corinthians 16:22). And we will show them the enemies of Jesus really didn’t have God as their Father. We know that because they didn’t love Jesus: “Jesus said to them, ‘If God were your Father, you would <em>love</em> me’” (John 8:42).</p>

<h4>To Love As We Ought</h4>

<p>But we will lavish on them the promises with great joy:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who <em>love</em> him.” (James 1:12)</p>

<p>“And we know that for those who <em>love</em> God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.” (Romans 8:28)</p>

<p>“But if anyone <em>loves</em> God, he is known by God.” (1 Corinthians 8:3)</p>

<p>“Because he holds fast to me in <em>love</em>, I will deliver him.” (Psalm 91:14)</p>

<p>“The Lᴏʀᴅ preserves all who <em>love</em> him.” (Psalm 145:20)</p></blockquote>

<p>And we will sing and pray with our children the wonderful truth that “We love because he first loved us” (1 John 4:19). Which means not only that he sent Christ while we were still sinners (Romans 5:8), but that his love takes out of us the heart of stone and wakens love for him.</p>

<blockquote><p>Spirit of God, descend upon my heart;<br>
Wean it from earth; through all its pulses move;<br>
Stoop to my weakness, mighty as Thou art;<br>
And <em>make me love Thee as I ought to love.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Now Is An Age</strong><br> 
On Reading John Donne’s <em>Death, Be Not Proud</em></p>




<p>One night, as I sat reading&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before the fire, and casting<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Calm shadows on the door behind my chair,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I saw the everlasting,<br>
And all the world receding<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here, and lodged this&nbsp;prayer:</p>


<p>“O God, all joy exceeding,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O Christ, forever living,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I praise you for this moment, this pure sight,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And ask, all sin forgiving,<br>
By your all-precious bleeding<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flesh, feed this delight.</p>


<p>And, if my hunger heeding,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And my desire&nbsp;allowing,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You fill my soul, and feasting, I ascend,<br>
I ask, all in me bowing,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That, by my lowly pleading<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This might never end.”</p>


<p>And thus, my hunger feeding,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And by these flames refining,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You rose and stood&nbsp;forth from this treasured page.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now all the room is shining,<br>
And time has ceased its speeding<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pace. Now is an age.</p>


<p>Imaginations breeding,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Behind me death proceeding,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I whisper, “Peace. Do not be proud, dear one,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There will be no impeding,<br>
I know where you are leading<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now. Let it be done.”</p>

<p>It was these words from Jesus in Luke 13 that the 42-year-old preacher took as his <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/sermons/unless-you-repent-you-will-all-likewise-perish">sermon title on June 5, 1988</a>.</p>

<p>Little did he know, a 22-year-old newly-wed was in attendance at the church for the first time that Sunday morning, and before long would be putting a megaphone to the preacher’s mouth so that people far beyond the humble downtown congregation could understand and embrace the truth that <em>God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him</em>.</p>

<h4>A New Life of Joyful Obedience</h4>

<p>That morning, the sermon came to a crescendo with the themes of repentance and faith and joy — themes that resonated deeply with this young visitor from the Western suburbs, themes on which he himself one day would seek to help others.</p>

<p>“I conclude that repentance involves believing God,” proclaimed the preacher, “rather than Satan’s claim that more joy can be found in sin than in obedience.” Repentance, the preacher continued,</p>

<blockquote><p>is a “being persuaded” about the danger of impenitence and the way of escape through repentance for the forgiveness of sins. It involves grief over past sins and present sinful tendencies. This is the significance of the sackcloth and ashes [in Luke 10:13 and Jonah 3:5]. And it involves turning from evil ways.</p>

<p>So faith and repentance are not properly two separate things. The turning of repentance is a turning from trusting in other things to a trusting in God. And with a new trust in God as counselor and protector and provider, there is also a turning to a new life of joyful obedience.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>New trust in God and a new life of joyful obedience.</em> While it may not have been the young man’s conversion — he thinks he was born again at age 10 — something fresh and profound was in the offing.</p>

<h4>Coming Closer to the Preacher</h4>

<p>The 22-year-old and his wife of only two weeks knew almost immediately they had found their church home. But they had no idea what lay ahead and how deeply God was shaping them and altering the trajectory of their lives.</p>

<p>Two and a half years later, in January of 1991, they would move into the preacher’s basement apartment. Then two years after that, in the Spring of 1993, word was getting around that the preacher was looking for a male assistant who could travel with him and meet pastoral needs in a new way. The man now was 27. He had gleaned enough from four years of the preacher’s sermons, and two years of his home-life, to know it would be a spiritually strategic role to take. And there wasn’t much else to do with his anthropology major! Despite his limited experience, he went to the preacher and asked to be considered. Soon he had the job. It was July 1993 — twenty years ago this month.</p>

<h4>Taking Up the Mantel of the Tape Ministry</h4>

<p>For nine months, the young man served in his new assistant’s role, and things went as expected. What he didn’t anticipate was the retirement of Arnie and Olive Nelson. In his own words,</p>

<blockquote><p>For 16 years, they faithfully had operated the church’s tape ministry as volunteers. They diligently ran a tape library for the congregation and managed a tape subscription service that began to grow significantly during [the preacher’s] first 14 years.</p>

<p>Arnie would come in every week and duplicate tapes. He was tall and slim and dignified and had a head of thick, silver hair. He was soft-spoken, and [the young man] loved to listen to him. Olive was bright, assertive, and organized. She managed the tape ministry administration by hand-typing all the tape labels (for probably 150–200 tapes per week), and hand-typing all the mailing labels. Arnie and Olive would package and mail the tapes. Olive’s database was a black notebook where she meticulously hand-recorded every transaction for every person.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now they were retiring, and the preacher had to find someone to take up the mantel of the tape ministry. This is what a good assistant is for, he thought. The preacher popped his head into his assistant’s office and said, “We need to do something with the tape ministry. I’d like you to make it happen.”</p>

<h4>Birthing DGM</h4>

<p>Soon it was clear to the preacher and his assistant that the tape ministry could be combined with a fresh organizational effort to spread the preacher’s growing corpus of books and coordinate his speaking beyond the little church.</p>

<p>Just the previous year, the preacher had written a missions book called <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/books/let-the-nations-be-glad"><em>Let the Nations Be Glad!</em></a>. He had a couple other relatively unappreciated books called <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/books/desiring-god"><em>Desiring God</em></a> and <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/books/the-pleasures-of-god"><em>The Pleasures of God</em></a> — the new, glorified tape ministry could help breathe some new life into these. The preacher had another book in the works, called <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/books/future-grace"><em>Future Grace</em></a>, based on Wednesday evening messages he was teaching with the chairman of the elders, named Tom Schreiner.</p>

<p>So in March of 1994, Desiring God Ministries was born. At first it was just books and tapes. Eventually some distant admirers of the preacher started a website for the ministry to help distribute his books and tapes online. In the mid 1990s, few were convinced that such a website would ever amount to much, but it was worth a try. At least it came free — and the preacher liked that.</p>

<h4>Constructing the Megaphone</h4>

<p>And so now for two full decades, the assistant has labored to construct a megaphone, increasingly complex and substantive and powerful, to put to the preacher’s mouth and send his message far and wide.</p>

<p>Under this old pastoral assistant’s leadership, DGM experienced growth and expanded the preacher’s influence in the little ecosystem of Reformed evangelicalism. Iterations included compact discs, radio, multimedia, and now a refocused effort to maximize and harness the amazing potential of the Worldwide Web.</p>

<p>He tried to hand the reigns to another director in the Fall of 2001, but before long, in 2003, he was summoned back to the helm. He moved the fledgling ministry to a new office that same year, eventually was part of the dropping of the “M” from DGM, and has overseen entrepreneurial stallions who redesigned the website and launched a video ministry and pioneered an outreach to internationals, as God even has blessed the reach of DG now to every nation in the world through the Internet.</p>

<h4>Focusing on the Web</h4>

<p>Today the young-man-turned-preacher’s-assistant is the president of DG, having passed the baton of his executive director’s role in 2010 to a blonde boy from Georgia, named Scott Anderson. And he is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1433535939/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1433535939&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=desigod-20">now an author himself</a>, and at his best when writing about the very themes he heard in that first message by the preacher — repentance and faith and joy. And this month marks 20 years since he first began working for the preacher. Next March will be 20 years since the founding of DG.</p>

<p>A lot has changed since 1994. The preacher completed his pastorate after 33 years and is now employed fulltime by the little tape and book ministry they started. DG has more than 20 employees, and the desiringGod.org website currently receives over 50,000 unique visitors to the site most days and saw almost 20 million visits in the last year.</p>

<p>But what has stayed the same is the young man’s posture of service and heart of radical generosity and risk-taking to help people everywhere understand and embrace the truth that <em>God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him</em>.</p>

<p>Something terrible and profound happened to all humans when Adam sinned. All except Jesus, that is, “who knew no sin” (2 Corinthians 5:21). Something came into the world that had not been there before — something very powerful and very deadly in everyone of us.</p>

<p>But it was not exactly a “thing.” Yet it was more than the bad things we <em>do</em>. Sin and sinning are not the same. We <em>do</em> sinful things because there is this something in us called “sin.” It is a dreadful and deadly deformity of every one of us.</p>

<p>Consider these amazing statements from the Bible about who you are before and after conversion to Christ.</p>

<h4>The Reign of Sin</h4>

<p>“All are <em>under</em> sin” (Romans 3:9). “I am sold <em>under</em> sin” (Romans 7:14). “You were once <em>slaves</em> of sin” (Romans 6:17, 20). In other words, before the power of grace through Christ entered our lives, we were not just tempted by sin, we were <em>ruled</em> by it. <em>Under</em> it. <em>Slaves</em> to it.</p>

<p>So sin was not just what we did. It was the master that governed what we did. It was like a king over a territory. “Sin reigned” (Romans 5:21).</p>

<p>Not only is sin deeper than bad <em>deeds</em>, it is also deeper than bad <em>desires</em>. “Sin produced in me all kinds of covetousness” (Romans 7:8). Covetousness is wrong <em>desire</em>. And sin “produces covetousness.” So sin is something deeper than desire. It <em>produces</em> sinful desires. It <em>has</em> desires (Romans 6:12).</p>

<p>Sin is not just the bad deed and not just the bad desire, it is the doer and the desirer. So when Paul says he often does what he doesn’t want to do, he exclaims, “So it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me” (Romans 7:16–17). Sin is not just the bad deed or desire. It is the dreadfully deep, powerful doer of the deed and the desire.</p>

<h4>What God Did</h4>

<p>Yet Paul does not excuse himself. “Wretched man that I am!” (Romans 7:24). Which means that this dreadful, deep, destructive power is who we <em>are</em> apart from Christ. It is not like a virus in me. It is a profound defect <em>of</em> me. The dreadful nature of sin is not just that it <em>indwells</em> me but that it <em>defines</em> me. It <em>is</em> me.</p>

<p>Know this about yourself. Don’t be naïve. Don’t be ignorant of your very nature. How will you worship your Redeemer, if you do not know what he has done for you? How will you pursue righteousness, if you do not know the deepest obstacle?</p>

<p>“Christ has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself” (Hebrews 9:26; 2 Corinthians 5:21). And when he died, all those who are his died with him and — united to him. “We have been united with him in a death like his” (Romans 6:5). This is what happens through faith in Christ, expressed in baptism.</p>

<p>“Our old self was crucified . . . that we would no longer be enslaved to sin” (Romans 6:6; Galatians 2:20). That dreadful, desire-producing, deed-producing, me-defining power died when I died with Christ.</p>

<h4>Living in God’s Victory</h4>

<p>What then shall we do? “You must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus” (Romans 6:11). In Jesus Christ! “Sin will have no dominion over you, since you are . . .under grace” (Romans 6:14). Once “under sin” as king. Now “under grace” as king — “so that, as sin <em>reigned</em>, . . . grace also might <em>reign</em>” (Romans 5:21).</p>

<p>“Sin will have no dominion over you, since you are . . . under grace” (Romans 6:14). “You have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God” (Romans 6:22). And it was God himself who freed you. “But thanks be <em>to God</em>, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart” (Romans 6:17).</p>

<p>It was God who dealt with sin in the death of Christ. It was God who put the monster sin to death. It was God who freed you from sin’s dominion. It is God who reigns over you. And it will be God who daily, through your faith, goes on putting the crucified monster to death (Colossians 3:5). “By the Spirit” you put sin to death (Romans 8:13). We are powerless in ourselves. God is the great sin-destroyer.</p>

<p>Worship him. And in his once-for-all victory over this dreadful deformity of our souls (Hebrews 9:26), do not let the defeated foe reign in your body (Romans 6:12). “Exhort one another every day . . . that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin” (Hebrews 3:13). God has worked a great victory over a great enemy. Live in it.</p>

<p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/askpastorjohn/is-my-boyfriends-porn-a"><strong>Is My Boyfriend’s Porn a Marriage Deal-Breaker? (Episode 122):</strong></a></p>


<blockquote>
  <p>Porn is destructive to a man’s capacities to love a woman purely for herself. He is training his body to need increasingly different, strange, erotic situations and bodies, and he is making it harder to be content with the real body of the woman that is going to be offered to him as his wife. And her body, as it is, at its best, is not going to be the airbrushed body of pornographic sites. And when she is 50 it isn’t going to be that either. And if he hasn’t cultivated a kind of pure love for his wife, for herself, as she is, then his eyes are going to be cruising continually beyond what she has to offer him at age 40 and 50 and 60. A woman needs to be able to trust a man. A woman feels profoundly compromised when a man says to her, “No, I really need more than you can offer me.” That is tragic for a man to say that to a woman. So porn is destructive to his capacity to love her for who she is.</p>
  <p>And here is the fourth and the last thing I will say about why it is so wrong for a man to do this. Porn is destructive to a man’s soul. His capacity to see God in the purity and the greatness of his glory is shriveled. It is compromised. The soul shrinks to the size and the quality of its pleasures.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Christian Hedonism can’t create a people who can cry and rejoice at the same time, let’s just close up shop, because you should always be crying and you should always be rejoicing, and there is always reason to do both in your life.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/askpastorjohn/does-christian-hedonism-make"><strong>Does Christian Hedonism Make Joy an Idol? (Episode 120):</strong></a></p>


<blockquote>
  <p>Christian Hedonism doesn’t make a god, or an idol, out of joy, because Christian Hedonism says we make a god out of whatever we find most joy in. That is the short answer. So find your greatest joy in God and, thus, be done with all idolatry. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My old flesh loved the world, craved the world, depended on the world, needed the world, and worshipped the world as its god and its satisfaction. And now all that died. And the world now has been crucified to me as a god. So if you say, “In what sense has the world died in me?” I say, “The world once was a god to me. It once was my life, and I killed it. I crucified it. I put it to death with its desires. And my flesh died. So my dying to it, and it dying to me, is the same reality. I killed this pseudo reality called the world, which was posing as an all-satisfying god to me and my old, blind, foolish self, who worshipped this world, died when I died with Christ.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pedagogy and education are secondary in the worship service. The category is this: <em>supernatural encounter with the living God as the preacher worships over the Word and draws the people into an experience of God almighty through his proclamation</em>. That is the category. And if you try to just replace that category with a lecture category, then her argument is going to make sense. All we are trying to do here is improve people’s understanding of some theological truths. Well, that is just not the main point of preaching. The first aim of preaching is not education, but encounter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this world there is so much sorrow. We are disappointed again and again. We are discouraged. We suffer. We fail. We are assaulted. We get sick. We die. Day after day the world is attacking our joy in God, our family’s joy in God, our church’s joy in God, our nation’s joy in God. We are constantly being assailed by things that threaten our joy and the question is this: How does God’s sovereignty work to help us fight for joy in God? Because joy in God is the reason we are made and it is what glorifies God. And the answer comes in Romans 8:28 and Romans 8:32 and Genesis 50:20.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the love that the Father has for the Son and the Son has for the Father, this love is essentially joy, because they are not lovingly enduring each other. There is no longsuffering in the Trinity like there is for recalcitrant sinners outside the Trinity. They have an infinite pleasure in each other’s perfections. And this is what just blows my mind and I love it. Therefore, joy is at the essence of God’s <em>God-ness</em>. It is the foundation of his sovereignty. The reason God is free and independent and powerful outside God is that he is completely happy inside God. He has no needs. And he is sovereignly independent because he is happy at the core of his being in his all-sufficiency, his self-sufficiency. And, therefore, when he creates the world, it is not owing to any deficiency in him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parents want their children to succeed in marriage. They don’t want them to get divorced because of irresolvable differences. And everybody who has been married 10 years — I have been married 44 — knows that all marriage is hard. All marriages, I laughingly say, are cross cultural. I married a woman from Georgia, for goodness’ sake and I am from South Carolina. So that is cross cultural.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>God is the one who subjected the world to futility. And not only that, he didn’t just do it like a clock maker who said, “OK, I am going to make this clock go bad now,” and then steps back and watches the clock go bad. He is involved in nature, as the Bible says everywhere, repeatedly governing the natural processes, like Jesus stopping the storm so that the disciples say, “Well, who then is this who rules, who commands the winds and the waves and they obey him,” which he does in Oklahoma as well as Israel.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The goal of pastoral ministry is <em>faith in our people </em>and<em> glory for our God</em>. And all of that — great faith, strong faith, indomitable faith, glorifying God — all of that spilling over for the same in the world. We want more of that to happen in the world. We don’t want our people to stumble into unbelief or into doubt when they are clobbered by some grief, loss, pain, or suffering.</p>

(Matthew 11:28)</em></p></blockquote>

<p>July marks my 20th year working with John Piper and many precious colleagues in this mission of Desiring God. It is a privilege so great that it surpasses my power to comprehend it.</p>

<p>Twenty years. That’s a generation. When I began, I hadn’t been alive much more than twenty years. Now I’m in my forties and fifty is on the horizon.</p>

<p>During this generational span I’ve gotten to be a part of Desiring God’s birth and growth, a church’s re-birth and growth,<sup>1</sup> and the birth and growth of five children. These have all been graces, overwhelmingly more than I deserve.</p>

<p>But they each have also required a lot of work, and more so as each has grown in size and complexity.</p>

<h4>Work Is Good and So Is Rest</h4>

<p>Now work is a good thing. God designed us to work with him (Genesis 2:15) and to work with all our might (Ecclesiastes 9:10). Yes, the futility to which we are all subjected (Romans 8:20) increases the difficulty and grief that infect our work this age (Genesis 3:17–19). But work is not evil (unless for evil ends); it’s just accompanied by evil.</p>

<p>The great news is that despite dogged futility, God promises to supply the strength we need for all the work of service he calls us to (1 Peter 4:11), even if it’s extraordinarily hard (1 Corinthians 15:10). So it is very good to present our bodies as living sacrifices in the holy labor of the kingdom (Romans 12:1), which encompasses everything God entrusts to us.</p>

<p>But God also designed and instructed us to rest. In fact, God considered it so important that his people rest that he built a rhythm of Sabbaths into the individual and corporate lives of Old Covenant Israel every seventh day (Leviticus 23:3), every seventh year (Leviticus 25:3–4), and every fiftieth year — the Jubilee (Leviticus 25:8–17).</p>

<p>This rhythm was intended by God to give his people regular and repeated experiences of receiving from him refreshment and provision so that they would not trust wholly in their own labors either for tomorrow’s survival or the next generation’s material security. It was a built-in spiritual discipline of laying aside works and laying hold of faith. If they observed his Sabbaths he promised them blessing (Deuteronomy 15:4–6), if they ignored them he promised them curses (Deuteronomy 28:15–68).</p>

<p>As New Covenant Israel, we now know that the fulfillment of the Sabbath is Jesus, who is both Lord of the Sabbath (Luke 6:5) and himself our Sabbath rest (Matthew 11:28). We are no longer required to keep the Old Testament Sabbath laws (Acts 15:28–29).</p>

<p>But this does not mean that we are not to rest. It means that our rest is even more profound. We rest from trying to attain holiness and God’s acceptance through keeping the requirements of the law by trusting that Jesus kept all the requirements of the law for us (Romans 8:3–5). In fact, Jesus stressed that our most important work is to <em>believe</em> him — a form of resting in his promises — not producing a lot of stuff for him (John 6:29). All our productivity is to flow from the rest of faith, otherwise it’s just sin (Romans 14:23).</p>

<p>But this more profound rest still must include rhythms of ceasing from work activities for the purpose of refreshment, reflection, renewal, and recalibration.</p>

<h4>A Failure to Rest</h4>

<p>Now for a confession: I have not done this consistently or faithfully enough over the last 20 years. As I look back, I have had too much (misplaced) faith in busy-ness (self-sufficiency) and insufficient faith that prayerful, reflective rest would result in greater blessing and more effective work. As a result, I think I’m seeing areas of my life — family, Desiring God, church — where, though there are no crises, changes need to be made.</p>

<h4>Laying Aside Restless Work</h4>

<p>So what am I going to do about this? I’m going to seek to lay aside the sin of restless work by:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Resting.</em> I’m laying aside vocational work for a season. The DG board of directors has very graciously granted me a three-month sabbatical from July through most of September as a 20th anniversary gift. During these months I plan to pursue…</li>
<li><em>Reflection.</em> It’s necessary to occasionally step out of the harried blur of laborious activity, maybe for an extended season, to pray and think carefully about what we’re doing with these vapor-lives we’ve been given (James 4:14). They’re passing quickly. We dare not waste them. One thing I plan to continue during my sabbatical is writing these Friday morning blog posts (at least most weeks) because they are very helpful reflection moments for me. So you’ll still hear from me! I’m also pursuing spiritual…</li>
<li><em>Renewal.</em> That’s a significant reason for the biblical Sabbath. Rest and reflection serve the soul’s renewal and encouragement in the faith. And out of this I will be pursuing…</li>
<li><em>Recalibration.</em> Insufficient rest and worshipful reflection lead to things getting out-of-whack. My wife, Pam, and I are looking forward to praying, discussing, and implementing ways our family can more effectively live for God’s glory in rhythms of both work and rest.</li>
</ol>


<p>I wonder if you’re like me and need to lay aside the weight of restless work? Persistent weariness, faith-wrestlings, confusion, and/or discouragement are signs to pay attention to. If so, it doesn’t require a sabbatical (although you might pray about it). Take a look at your rest and reflection habits and ask a few trusted counselors for feedback. It may be that a recalibration is in order for the purpose of spiritual renewal.</p>

<p>Something John Piper said to me sticks in my mind: “work hard and rest well.” I am finding that the latter is very important for the former.</p>

Is your first reaction to the sin in others anger? Or is it broken-hearted grief at the stench of death around them?</p>

<p>When I read Judy Nicastro’s opinion piece in <em>The New York Times</em>, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/opinion/my-abortion-at-23-weeks.html">My Abortion, at 23 Weeks</a>,” my first reaction, to be honest, was anger and bitterness. In one of the most influential newspapers in the world, yet another person, <em>this time a mother</em>, was making the case that a life with disabilities is not worth existing. She concluded that it was kind for her to kill her baby boy in her womb, even though she knew it put the other twin at risk for miscarriage.</p>

<p>And then I remembered: she is dead in her sins, and willingly, even if unknowingly, is following a murderer and liar (see Ephesians 2:1–3). Valuing life doesn’t come naturally to a person who is spiritually dead.</p>

<p>Yet the little boy, even if his life was short and very hard, could have been born. This little boy could have been held and loved by his parents. Ms. Nicastro, a self-described irreligious “old-school liberal” described her son as “desperately wanted” and she said the thought of losing him was “unbearable.” So there was common grace at work. The motherly affections embedded in her by God were completely snuffed out. And the signs of rebellious independence from God’s intentional handiwork were also evident (see Psalm 139:13–16). She and her husband would do anything to save their son, that is, on the condition that “he could have a good quality of life.” Before he was even born he had to meet some stone-hard expectations.</p>

<p>When they determined their son wouldn’t measure up, the family pediatrician pronounced the boy’s death sentence: “Termination is a reasonable option, and a reasonable option that I can support.” Two other medical professionals agreed. Not one person spoke up for the little boy, including his “conservative, Catholic father.”</p>

<h4>So Much Against the Little Ones</h4>

<p>There is so much active opposition to little humans with disabilities being allowed to breathe the air we do and feel the comfort of their parents’ arms. <em>The New York Times</em> regularly uses its leadership position to support abortion throughout a pregnancy. The President of the United States has refused to even discuss the recent House of Representatives bill that would prohibit abortion after 20 weeks. He called state Senator Wendy Davis’ remarkable energy for more abortions in Texas “something special.” Various courts in other states have already struck down state laws that would protect unborn life after 20 weeks.</p>

<p>Add to these facts the innumerable quiet conversations that are happening all around the world about how horrible it must be to live with a disability, or so people venture to imagine, many of whom have never spoken to a real person affected by disability. How many doctors are privately sharing their disdain for unborn babies through their so-called compassionate words about preventing suffering? It is all so very sad.</p>

<p>It is too easy to become cynical and calloused, to conclude that we can do nothing because the trajectory in the culture and in our laws is so against the lives of those with disabilities.</p>

<h4>Remembering Our Hope</h4>

<p>We don’t have to despair. We must be guided by Someone and something greater as we seek to save the little ones and serve their parents. We must hope in the one who made us and sustains us.</p>

<p>Because of Jesus, we know that someday abortion (and all other evil) will end and all things will be made new (Revelation 21:1–7).</p>

<p>Because of Jesus, we know that spiritually dead people can become alive (Ephesians 2:4–10).</p>

<p>Because of Jesus, we know that suffering leads to joy (Hebrews 12:1–2).</p>

<p>Because of Jesus, we know that all our sins and all our unrighteousness can be forgiven (1 John 1:9).</p>

<p>Because of Jesus, we can love the enemies of unborn children and do good to them, especially in telling them about this Jesus (Luke 6:35)!</p>

<p>Nobody is denying that this life of parenting a child with disabilities is hard; that would be foolish and wrong. And nobody should think that once the child is born that parents universally understand they made the right decision. Sentimentality about children changes nothing. But God uses these children and their stories to bring life to spiritually dead people. <em>That is my story</em>. I was dead in my sins until God crushed me through the crucible of disability and suffering, and he proved himself good and worthy.</p>

<h4>Tell the Good News</h4>

<p>So today is the day to tell stories to people who won’t understand them, indeed, cannot understand them, not until God gives them life. They should know about the God who creates boys with disabilities like my son, and how glad I am that God made him a part of my life and family and church. And they should hear from dads who trusted God when their boys and girls died very young, like <a href="http://youtu.be/Bg6Mmoer3rk">this father in Australia</a>.</p>

<p>We must make evident that God is good and sovereign over <em>all</em> things. The church has an unusual opportunity to make much of God almost everywhere in the world by how we respond to disability.</p>

<p>I easily get angry when I read opinion pieces about the necessity of abortion, and I too frequently direct that anger at the wrong things. Sin and Satan are the real enemies of the boy who was aborted by his mother. And Jesus came to both destroy the works of Satan and save sinners, including sinners like me, and mothers who abort their children. We have good news to tell! May God give you the privilege today to speak of our good and powerful King Jesus, who brings life and hope and joy, even in the hardest of circumstances.</p>

<p>“Every instance of treasuring images of sexual immorality in our hearts, every eager glance at pornography, all of our lustful gawking — everything — is paid for by Jesus in his death for sinners.” (21)</p>


<p>“The tide will begin to turn in your struggle against pornography when you begin to grasp forgiving grace and transforming grace, as you learn to repent.” (26)</p>


<p>“Pornography is a plague that has destroyed countless lives and can also destroy yours. The sobering truth is that you do not have the resources to change within yourself.” (27–28)</p>


<p>“Jesus’ grace to change you is stronger than pornography's power to destroy you. Jesus’ grace is stronger than your own desires to watch sex.” (28)</p>


<p>“Godly sorrow doesn’t fear that people will find out about your sin. Rather, you fear that God — the only person who ultimately matters — always knew. I am a very sinful man in great need of the blood of Jesus to forgive me for all the ways I have failed God.” (39)</p>


<p>“Until God is your chief concern — until sinning against him is what makes your heart break — you will never turn the corner.” (43)</p>


<p>“Employing radical measures is the path to life, while indulging sin is the path to hell. God does not forbid sexual immorality because he wants you to be miserable; God forbids it because sexual immorality leads to brokenness, sadness, emptiness, death, and hell.” (63)</p>


<p>“Though the initial stages of temptation seem innocent, fun, and even enjoyable, eventually the sin of indulging in the adulterous woman of porn will take over your life and consume your time, your strength, and your body (Proverbs 5).” (96)</p>


<p>“I have no statistics on how long the average career is for actresses in pornography, but I'll bet it's pretty short. I’m confident there are no porn actresses who are sixty years old. Probably not even forty. Why not? Because selfish men who consume porn like their women young. For such men, there's no interest in wrinkles, liver spots, or white hair. There's no attraction in crow's-feet, varicose veins, and sagging skin. In other words, there’s no interest in real women.” (96)</p>


<p>“God does not ‘hate’ sex; he hates faithless sex with forbidden women, but he loves faithful sexual expressions in the context of marriage. God loves it so much that he commands, not just that it happen, but that it be enjoyed to the point of intoxication.” (99)</p>


<p>“Only arrogant men look at pornography.” (108)</p>


<p>“Men look at pornography out of an arrogant desire to see women in a way that God does not allow. They show arrogant defiance to God's commands, rejecting the delight of sexual intimacy in marriage and deciding for themselves what they believe is better — looking at naked women in porn. They show arrogant disregard for God's call to selfless marital love. They show arrogant derision for the female actresses whom they should be seeking to respect as women who need to hear the good news of Jesus. They show arrogant disdain for their own children by hiding their sin and inviting the enemy into their home and their marriage. They show arrogant disrespect toward all those who would be scandalized if their sin were known. The root problem with men who look at porn is not neediness — it is arrogance.” (110)</p>


<p>“It is impossible to look at porn and be humble. Because this is true, it gives us a key weapon in the fight against porn.” (111)</p>


<p>“Porn is the trading of gratitude for greed. Porn trades joy in the reality God has graced you with for greed in the counterfeit world he has not.” (127)</p>


<p>“There are many strategies to pursue this joy. The most significant one is to learn to delight in God above all else.” (130)</p>


<p>“This is the vicious cycle of lust. Lust never has what it wants because it never has enough. Lust steals joy by creating an endless state of discontentment in the constant search for that one next thing you don't have yet. Lust is never happy because lust is never full.” (130)</p>


<p>“Though you may initially be drawn to Christ out of your great need to be free from pornography, your struggle against this sin is just the beginning of God's greater purpose in saving you. You are saved, not just to be free from pornography, but to know and experience the joy of walking with Jesus, of following him, and of becoming more and more like him.” (143)</p>


<p>“A living, breathing relationship with the Savior of the world will drive porn out of your life quicker than anything else. When you turn your eyes to Jesus, there isn't room for anything else in your heart because he fills it up. When you open the blinds of a pitch-black room, the sunlight drives away the darkness.” (144–145)</p>


<p>“Pornography is a wholly selfish act that eclipses the concerns, needs, and well-being of everyone around you (1 Thessalonians 4:3–7).” (153)</p>


<p>“If you are trusting in Jesus, pornography will never have the final say in your life. Forty-five zillion years from now, pornography will be nowhere in your mind as you perpetually behold the beauty of the spotless Lamb who was slain for your sin and mine. There is a day coming — and it is not far away — when you will see Jesus himself. When you see him, he will change you into his perfect likeness.” (158)</p>

<p>Four thousand times an hour, or more,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each day and night, since I was six<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weeks old inside my mother's womb,</p>


<p>My trusty heart (a metaphor<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of what?) with ceaseless double clicks<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Has beat.&nbsp;Click-click. Click-click. For whom?</p>


<p>And you, my Lady, not before,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or during, did a single drug admix,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or cause one click-click to resume;</p>


<p>Nor, when God wakened me and swore<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By his own name and crucifix<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That my new heart would live and bloom</p>


<p>Forever, were you guarantor<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of this, nor seed. Did you affix<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A root? You wear a cause costume.</p>


<p>And yet you have a noble chore,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And God decides, not heretics,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When, after birth, beyond the womb,</p>


<p>You serve. And whom. You never bore<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My germination. Candle wicks&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do not cause fire, though all assume,</p>


<p>Since you were there, and since you wore<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your guise, that you can do such tricks.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But no. Whatever you exhume</p>


<p>Lies breathless, Lady, on the floor.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You prop your corpses up with sticks<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like men, and make the air a tomb.</p>

<p>The zoo is a wonderful opportunity for the Christian — both for personal worship and worldview formation. Here’s an effort to help Christians, who should be the best of all zoo-goers, make the most of their experiences this summer.</p>

<p><strong> 1) Prepare ahead of time.</strong></p>

<p>The day before, or morning of, you may want to re-read Genesis 1–2, Psalm 8, or other biblical texts that address animals (like Isaiah 11:6–9, James 3:7, or Job 38–41 below). Pray that God would make the zoo a rich, spiritual experience as you have a chance to observe up close some of his creatures you typically don’t see.</p>

<p>Parents may want to consider rallying the troops for a short Bible reading and explanation and prayer time before hitting the road. Set the tone early that the zoo can be a profound spiritual experience of learning and worship for the children of the Father who made the animals.</p>

<p>Perhaps check the website of the zoo the week before. Most will have some feature to help plan your day and a zoo map to give you the lay of the land.</p>

<p><strong> 2) Be astounded by the animals.</strong></p>

<p>Here’s where we just dive in and enjoy the best of what the zoo has to offer. Linger and read the descriptions. Pause. Observe. Delight in the details, and discuss how God has equipped the different species for their varying settings and environments. Try to notice the distinctive features of each animal, and consider what this particular creature is saying about God. The heavens declare the glory of God (Psalm 19:1) — and so do his beasts if we have the eyes to see.</p>

<p>Compare your relative smallness to the elephant or the hippo, or the towering giraffe. Survey the raw strength and agility of the bear or the gorilla. Imagine what it would be like in the wild to stumble across a lion, “mightiest among beasts” (Proverbs 30:30), and thank God for good fences. Smile at the oddness of the ostrich and the playful penguin. Ogle at the rhino. Be sobered by the shark, the alligator, the crocodile. Laugh with the hyena and the silly monkey. Try to catch the eye of the tiger.</p>

<p><strong> 3) Be humbled to be human.</strong></p>

<p>As amazing as the animals are, don’t let this important zoo lesson be lost on you and your crowd: <em>Humans are the really spectacular creatures.</em> Celebrate with Psalm 8.</p>

<blockquote><p>What is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor. You have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the seas. (Psalm 8:4–8)</p></blockquote>

<p>The zoo is a living testimony to James 3:7: “Every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind.” It’s a zoo lesson we too often miss. What’s even more impressive than whales communicating with each other is that some zookeeper just communicated it to us with more conciseness and clarity than any animal will ever achieve.</p>

<p>Wayne Grudem draws attention to this comparative wonder in his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0310286700?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=desigod-20"><em>Systematic Theology</em></a> chapter on “The Creation of Man.” Yes, the animals are “good” (Genesis 1:21, 25), but not until the creation of humans does God say, “very good” (Genesis 1:31).</p>

<blockquote><p>Out of all the creatures God made, only one creature, man, is said to be made “in the image of God.” . . .</p>

<p>No animal will ever spend an hour in intercessory prayer for the salvation of a relative or a friend! . . . [E]ven in developing physical and technical skills we are far different from animals: beavers still build the same kind of dams they have built for a thousand generations, birds still build the same kind of nests, and bees still build the same kind of hives. But we continue to develop greater skill and complexity in technology, in agriculture, in science, and in nearly every field of endeavor.</p>

<p>Our likeness to God is also seen in our human creativity in areas such as art, music, and literature, and in scientific and technological inventiveness. . . .</p>

<p>In the area of emotions, our likeness to God is seen in a large difference in degree and complexity of emotions. Of course, animals do show some emotions . . . . But in the complexity of emotions that we experience, once again we are far different than the rest of creation. (442–447)</p></blockquote>

<p>For the Christian, a trip to the zoo is not just a chance to learn about the animal creatures, but gain perspective on the impressiveness of the human creature as well. And most of all, it’s an opportunity to learn about the Creator himself.</p>

<p><strong>4) Marvel at the Maker.</strong></p>

<p>Even more spectacular than the beasts is humanity — and even more spectacular than humanity is God. For the Christian, the progression of our amazement from a good day at the zoo goes in this sequence: from animals, to man, to the Maker himself.</p>

<p>He striped the tiger and spotted the leopard. He’s infinitely “bigger” than the elephant,
“smaller” than the tiniest critter, and admirably fiercer than the greatest lion. The raven, mountain goat, wild donkey, wild ox, ostrich, horse, hawk, eagle, Behemoth and Leviathan — all have something to say about the incomparable majesty of their Maker in Job 38–41. And not only is he the Maker of them all, but in his Son, he has stooped to add humanity to his divinity and become our Redeemer.</p>

<p>When Christians marvel at our Maker, we mean not only the God who made everything, but the God-man who was his happy agent in creation (John 1:3; Hebrews 1:2), upholds the universe now (Colossians 3:17; Hebrews 1:3), has done the decisive work of redemption (Colossians 2:13–15; Hebrews 1:3; John 19:30), and is bringing to pass a new and even more mindboggling creation.</p>

<p>If angels “long to look” into such a salvation (1 Peter 1:12), how much more would the animals?</p>

<p><strong>5) Consider the coming new creation.</strong></p>

<p>As spectacular as God’s first creation is, the consummated final creation of our Redeemer will be even better. For now, the created world and its creatures, impressive as they are, remain under a curse because of our rebellion against God (Genesis 3:14–19). If we marvel now at God’s created world, how much more will we stand in awe in the coming new earth.</p>

<p>Animals will be there, it seems, and it will be even more glorious than nature red in tooth and claw.</p>

<blockquote><p>The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together; and a little child shall lead them. The cow and the bear shall graze; their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. The nursing child shall play over the hole of the cobra, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder’s den. (Isaiah 11:6–9)</p></blockquote>

<p>God didn’t create the animals only to wipe them away, but decorate his eternal glory and serve humanity’s everlasting joy. While the Bible doesn’t promise that all dogs go to heaven, or that your favorite pet will be there, we can bank on it being brilliantly better than even the best day at the zoo.</p>

So how exactly does a pastor wisely lead people when his energy is so quickly depleted by being around people?</p>


<p>This is one of many topics Jared Wilson addresses in his forthcoming book for pastors: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1433536641?ie=UTF8&tag=desigod-20"><em>The Pastor's Justification: Applying the Work of Christ in Your Life and Ministry</em></a> (Crossway, July 31).</p>


<p>I put Wilson on the line to talk with him about introverts in the ministry, especially their strengths and pitfalls. We started by talking about his ministry and how gospel-centrality became a reality for him. Then we talked about the insecurity many pastors feel in their role. We spent the remainder of the time talking about “introversion,” what the word means, how pastoral ministry can force extroverted expectations on the pastor, and, on the other hand, how the “introvert” label can become a trump card excuse for laziness. He shares advice for pastors who are more comfortable in their study than in the fellowship hall. We talk about how introverts can protect the time they need to recharge, and he explores questions that introverts who are possibly called to the ministry need to ask early on. </p>

But there is none.</p>

<p>If I were to say we are between tsunamis or tornadoes, someone would say, “That tree just fell on my house,” or, “That was my mother whose plane crashed in Ohio,” or, “My uncle was among the tourists killed in Pakistan,” or, “My wife’s battle with cancer just ended — in death.”</p>

<p>So there is no lull. If we echo the voice of God from the Scriptures, it will always be during someone’s calamity. Which means, if we weep with those who weep, the keyboard will be tear-stained — always.</p>

<p>Today I want to focus only on one biblical theme: What are the answers to the biblical question, “Where is God?” during calamity? I call it a <em>biblical</em> question because this question <em>is</em> in the Bible. Let these examples shape the way you answer this question.</p>

<p><strong>1. God is in heaven doing all that he pleases.</strong></p>

<p>The psalmist asks, “Why should the nations say, ‘<em>Where is their God</em>?’” And he answers, “Our God is in the heavens; he does all that he pleases” (Psalm 115:2–3).</p>

<p>So one answer to the question, that is always true, is that God is reigning on his throne in heaven and doing things according to his infinitely wise and good plan. That’s why it “pleases” him. It is always wise and always good.</p>

<p>“O Lᴏʀᴅ, how manifold are your works! In wisdom have you done them all” (Psalm 104:24). “My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose” (Isaiah 46:10).</p>

<p><strong>2. God is in the same place he was when you sang in the night.</strong></p>

<p>In Job 35:9–10, Elihu says, “Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out; they call for help because of the arm of the mighty. But none says, ‘<em>Where is God</em> my Maker, who gives songs in the night?’”</p>

<p>Most of the time people don’t think about God. He is a non-factor in their lives. For example, they usually don’t say, “Where is God?” when he is giving them songs in the night.</p>

<p>For millions, God is not a worshiped treasure in times of fortune; he is a whipping boy in times of trouble. We bring him out of the back-pocket of our neglect and wag our finger in the face of the Almighty. This is very dangerous.</p>

<p>So another answer to the question, “Where is God?” is this: God is in the same place he was when he gave you thousands of good days and nights. (See also Jeremiah 2:7–8.)</p>

<p><strong>3. God is testing me in his hiddenness and will rescue me perfectly.</strong></p>

<p>The Sons of Korah sing their hope-filled lament in Psalms 42 and 43. “My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day long, “<em>Where is your God</em>?” . . .  Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation” (Psalm 42:3–5).</p>

<p>The people of God suffer calamity. And those who love the sovereignty of God are often taunted, “Where is your God now?” The psalmist answers, “I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.” In other words, sooner or later, my God will restore my fortunes — in this life, or a million-fold in the next — and I will praise him.</p>

<p>So a third answer to the question is this: My God is testing me and will come to save me at the perfect time, in life (2 Timothy 4:17) or in death (Revelation 2:10). (See also Joel 2:17–19.)</p>

<p><strong>4. God is preparing for his vengeance on those who taunt his beloved.</strong></p>

<p>The psalmist Asaph gives another blunt answer of warning. “Why should the nations say, ‘<em>Where is their God?</em>’ Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants be known among the nations before our eyes!” (Psalm 79:10).</p>

<p>God often brings his loved ones into trouble for their purifying discipline (Hebrews 12:5–11). While they are in distress, the nations may say, “So much for your good and loving God! Where is he now?”</p>

<p>The answer is, <em>He is preparing for a day of vengeance on those who taunt his loved ones</em>. “Return sevenfold into the lap of our neighbors the taunts with which they have taunted you, O Lᴏʀᴅ!” (Psalm 79:12). (See also Micah 7:8–10.)</p>

<p><strong>5. God is standing in front of them, ready to forgive.</strong></p>

<p>Finally, Jesus said to his adversaries, “I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.” They said to him therefore, “<em>Where is your Father?</em>” Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also” (John 8:18–19).</p>

<p>Where is God when non-Christians scoff at Jesus, saying, “Where is your Father?” The answer is, <em>He is their midst</em>. He is pursuing them. He is on the way to the cross to open a way for his enemies to be rescued from his vengeance. He is standing in front of them: “Before Abraham was, I am” (John 8:58).</p>

<p>And so it is today. When skeptics deride the suffering followers of Jesus, and say, “Where is your so-called loving Father?” the answer is this: He is right there in front of them. His people are his witness to the world. And what we say is, The Lᴏʀᴅ reigns. And if you will trust his Son, he will turn all your losses (like ours) into everlasting gain. That is why we “rejoice in tribulation” (Romans 5:3).</p>

<p>From the book, page 44:</p>

<blockquote><p>Never forgot that when we are dealing with any pleasure in its healthy and normal and satisfying form, we are, in a sense, on the Enemy’s ground. I know we have won many a soul through pleasure. All the same, it is His invention, not ours. He made the pleasures: all our research so far has not enabled us to produce one. All we can do is to encourage the human to take the pleasure which our Enemy has produced, at times, or in ways, or in degrees, which He has forbidden. Hence we always try to work away from the natural condition of any pleasure to that in which it is least natural, least redolent of its Maker, and least pleasurable. An ever increasing craving for an ever diminishing pleasure is the formula. It is more certain; and it’s better <em>style</em>. To get the man’s souls and give him <em>nothing</em> in return — that is what really gladdens Our Father’s Heart. (C.S. Lewis, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060652896/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060652896&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=desigod-20"><em>The Screwtape Letters</em></a>, 44)</p></blockquote>

We see it in the <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/live-bold">church’s boldness</a> — that is, the church’s outspoken clarity about the identity and significance of Jesus.</p>

<p>This boldness actually hems up the entire story of Acts with its key appearances in Peter’s first sermon (Acts 2:29) and Paul’s concluding hospitality ministry (Acts 28:31), not to mention several mentions throughout the gospel’s advance (Acts 4:13; 29, 31; 9:27–28; 13:46; 14:3; 18:26, 28; 26:26). From start to finish, and everywhere in-between, we see that the life of the early church was consumed with Jesus. They knew him and were open about him. This is the boldness that characterized the church then and should characterize the church today. But how exactly?</p>

<h4>Getting to the How</h4>

<p>How do we live with this kind of clarity and outspokenness about Jesus? How do we live bold?</p>

<p>It has to do with knowing Jesus. I mean, <em>really</em> knowing Jesus, as if our lives depended on it. I think that’s what’s happening in the portrait we see from Acts. Back then, and here now, grasping the glory of Jesus isn’t an extracurricular activity to our discipleship, <em>it is our discipleship</em>. Who he is defines who we are. If we know anything, let us know him. For if we can convince our neighbors to vote like us, but we know not Jesus, we are just pushy religious people. And if we are well read, and understand the numerous pitfalls among the emerging millennial generation, and if our church has a podcast, so as to be heard, but we know not Jesus, we are nothing. Nothing. And the list could go on.</p>

<p>So then, let us know Jesus. Let us press on to know Jesus, theologically, biblically, personally.</p>

<p>What I hope to do in the rest of this post is sketch a vision for knowing Jesus like this, which implies two things I want to make clear. First, knowing Jesus like this is not the full experience of how I know him now. I have come to know Jesus (or rather be known by Jesus, Galatians 4:9), but I am not writing as an aged saint with decades of communion in my background. I am writing as a mere disciple with a vision — one who has tasted and seen Jesus’s goodness and who, by grace, has an appetite for more. So hear my words as aspiration and hope, not as experience and advice. I am writing as someone like you.</p>

<p>Second, this vision of living bold isn’t an over-romanticized view of the early church. The first-century Christians had their own troubles. And in fact, much of the theological truth we understand about Jesus today has come as the gold of yesterday’s doctrinal furnaces. This is not an exercise to “get back” so much as to step forward — to build upon the grace given to our forefathers in order to wait well now for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is vision. And every vision must navigate between the extremes of historical adulation and chronological snobbery. Only one has ever done it perfectly. We must live as faithfully as we know how for such a time as whenever it is. And an indispensable part of that in every generation of the church is to know Jesus. Here is a snapshot of what that might look like today.</p>

<h4>To Know Jesus, Theologically</h4>

<p>This is the nuts and bolts section. Jesus is God of God, Light of Light, True God of True God. He is “begotten, not made,” the early creed said. He is of the same essence as the Father. He is the second person of the triune God — the one God in Trinity and Trinity in unity, having neither persons blended nor essence divided. The person of the Father is distinct, the person of the Son another, and that of the Holy Spirit still another. But the divinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is one. Their glory is equal, their majesty coeternal. And it was through the Son — the uncreated, immeasurable, eternal Son — that all things were made. And it was him, who for us and our salvation, came down from heaven by the power of the Holy Spirit, became incarnate by the virgin Mary, and was made truly human. Fully God, fully man, one person with two natures — glorious hypostatic union. This is Jesus.</p>

<p>Do we know him like this? Over centuries, the church has pressed deep into biblical concepts to faithfully articulate the identity of Jesus and guard against error. Individuals and communities devoted their lives to this cause. Over against the encroaching tides of new thought-systems and complex philosophical cultures, orthodox doctrine has persevered. The truth has stood, and stands. And we should know it. The Athanasian Creed (from which much of the preceding paragraph borrows) claims that knowing Jesus theologically is a matter of life or death. To not keep the doctrine of the Trinity (including the doctrine of Christ) means you will “doubtless perish eternally.” Again, this is not extracurricular to the Christian life. This is the heart and center.</p>

<p>Practically, I think a good step in this direction is to memorize the <a href="http://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/creeds/nicene-creed">Nicene Creed</a> The idea is not that every Christian become a seminary-level expert on Christology. Rather, the hope is that we would be acquainted with the primary theological categories and have at least one creedal go-to. The Nicene is a good one.</p>

<h4>To Know Jesus, Biblically</h4>

<p>The triune God has revealed himself preeminently in Jesus Christ. And his testimony is the organizing principle of Scripture. We should know him there.</p>

<p>The Bible is the story of God’s glory and grace that stretches centuries and cultures and literary genres, all pointing to and holding up the definitive witness of Jesus — who is the Word of God made flesh (John 1:14), the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature (Hebrews 1:3), the Lamb who was slain before the foundation of the world (Revelation 13:8), in whom all the fullness of deity is pleased to dwell (Colossians 2:9), who upholds the universe by the word of his power (Hebrews 1:3).</p>

<p>Jesus reminded his disciples that everything written about him in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled (Luke 24:44–45). Peter said that God foretold <em>by the mouth of all the prophets</em> that his Christ would suffer (Acts 3:18). Paul said that the gospel mystery of Jesus was made known through the prophetic writings (Romans 16:25–27). From Genesis to Revelation, the Book is about Jesus. That’s the point in the Redeemer mentioned in Genesis 3 who would come to crush the serpent (Genesis 3:15). That’s why God promised Abraham that through his offspring all the peoples of the earth would be blessed (Genesis 12:1–3). That’s why he told Moses that there would be a prophet like him who would rise up in Israel and speak his word (Deuteronomy 18:15). That’s why God told David that he would have a son who would be enthroned as King forever (2 Samuel 7:16), a King to whom Solomon still looked and the prophets eagerly proclaimed.</p>

<p>The Redeemer, the Son, the Prophet, the King — he’s the one the whole world longed for. And then he came. Born in Bethlehem, in a stable, the promised one came. And he lived the perfect life, tempted in every way we’ve been tempted, yet he never sinned. He trusted his Father and was faithful to the end, to the point of death, even death on a cross. On a cross. A cross where he suffered in the place of sinners, where he was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities. The cross of his condemnation brought us peace. The scene of his forsakenness became the grounds to our adoption. Jesus, by faith in him, reconciles us to the Father. Jesus makes us no longer enemies, but sons and daughters. No longer dead in Adam and destined for wrath. But now, because of Jesus, we are alive in him, alive to God, filled with his Spirit, and drawn into this very story of his glory.</p>

<p>Practically, this means we read the Bible. Jesus’s people are Bible-people. Let us read it through, and study it, and memorize it, and every time we open its pages breathe this prayer with our hearts: “Show us Christ.”</p>

<h4>To Know Jesus, Personally</h4>

<p>We want to know Jesus theologically and biblically because we know him personally, and in order to know him more personally. We can’t extract any of these perspectives if we’re to <em>really</em> know him, and especially not this one.</p>

<p>If we focus exclusively on the theological side, it could become all about not falling into error. If we focus exclusively on the biblical side, it could dwindle down to a cerebral exercise of one exegetical discovery after another for the sake of exegetical discovery. But if we know him personally, the uncreated Son is the one who saved us. The Suffering Servant is the one who suffered for my sins. The priest after the order of Melchizedek is the one who prays for me, who knows all of my failings and weaknesses and who never tires to plead for me. If we know him personally, he is not just the Jesus of theological categories, or the Jesus of canonical testimony, he is Jesus <em>my Lord and my God</em>. Jesus, <em>our Savior</em>.</p>

<p>Practically, this means we commune with him as we learn of him. It means we think about Jesus and we talk about Jesus. It means we love him.</p>

<p>This is the joy we have been saved to, that we know Jesus, and in knowing him, live in outspoken clarity about his identity and significance.</p>

The God of the universe focused his special revelation and redeeming work on one small ethnic people, Israel, for 2,000 years — from the calling of Abram in Genesis 12 to the coming of Christ. For all that time “he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways” (Acts 14:16).</p>

<p>Then at the entry of his Son into the world, all this changed.</p>

<p>As Jesus was leaving to return to heaven he said, “Repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in [my] name <em>to all nations</em>” (Luke 24:47). “Go therefore and make disciples <em>of all nations</em>” (Matthew 28:19). This was a pivotal change in the history of the world.</p>

<h4>God’s Careful Planning</h4>

<p>But the command to disciple all the nations was not an afterthought. It was the plan from the moment God chose Israel. God said to Abram, “In you all the families of the earth shall be blessed” (Genesis 12:3).</p>

<p>Then Paul applied this to the gospel of justification through faith in Christ: “The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, ‘In you shall all the nations be blessed’” (Galatians 3:8). So God was getting ready to reach the nations with the gospel of Christ when he chose Abram 2,000 years before Christ came.</p>

<p>Why, then, such a long delay, before Christ came and the Great Commission was given in his name?</p>

<h4>Why the Long Delay?</h4>

<p>Because in God’s wisdom he knew that the nations of the world would grasp the nature of Christ and his work better against the backdrop of Israel’s 2,000 year history of law and grace, faith and failure, sacrifice and atonement, wisdom and prophecy, mercy and judgment.</p>

<p>Here’s the way Paul put it in Romans 3:19–20: “Whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that <em>every mouth</em> may be stopped, and <em>the whole world</em> may be held accountable to God. For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight.” In other words, God spoke for 2,000 years to Israel so that the “whole world” would realize that there is no hope of getting right with God through “works done by us in righteousness” (Titus 3:5).</p>

<h4>Lesson Book for the Nations</h4>

<p>Israel’s history is not just about Israel. It’s about “every mouth” and “the whole world.” This was not a 2,000-year detour. God was writing a lesson book for the nations. It’s not an accident that our Bible has the Old Testament in it.</p>

<p>When Paul preached to the non-Jewish Greeks on Mars Hill, he said that up till now the “times of ignorance” held sway. God had let them go their own way. But no more. “Now God commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will judge <em>the world</em> in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead” (Acts 17:30–31).</p>

<h4>The “Now” of All Nations</h4>

<p>This is the “now” we live it. And it is a thrilling “now.” “<em>Now</em> God commands all people everywhere to repent.” The risen Christ authorizes this command. He will be with us in its fulfillment.</p>

<p>We live in the “now” of “all nations.” God prepared for this moment for 2,000 years before Christ. He has been pursuing it for 2,000 years since Christ. Jesus is alive and mighty to save. And it is harvest time.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DGBlog/~4/sqGH1UnWDvA" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0500";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DGBlog/~3/sqGH1UnWDvA/the-thrilling-now-of-christian-mission";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"desiringgod.org-blog-post-5325";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0";a:1:{s:8:"origLink";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/the-thrilling-now-of-christian-mission";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:19:"

<p>“The Professor,” Digory Kirke, proved to be a well-travelled and advantageous ally for the children in C.S. Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia, and our own professor-friend Joe Rigney is a well-travelled guide to show us (and our children) through the wardrobe and into Lewis’s fantasy world.</p>

<p>Joe teaches Christian worldview at Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary. We both have a pair of young sons we’re eager to soon introduce to Narnia. Before diving in, I thought it would be good to glean what I could from Joe, and hit record for your sake.</p>

<p>In this new episode of Theology Refresh, Joe gives all Lewis readers — but especially parents of young children — some ideas on why turn to Narnia, which book to start with, and how to wisely step into Lewis’s fantasy world of talking animals, mythical beasts, magic, glimpses of glory, and lessons about the real world. The Narnia tales are not only one of the great literary accomplishments of the twentieth century, but a poignant tool for bringing up our children in the discipline and instruction of the Lord (Ephesians 6:4).</p>

That would have been costly.</p>

<p>And Abraham is not alone. God calls each of us to obedience that’s costly, like loving our enemies, sharing the gospel, forgiving those who hurt us, and battling sin.</p>

<p>So how did Abraham obey, when it was so costly?</p>

<h4>Two Simple Words</h4>

<p>God tells us in Hebrews 11:8, “By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance.”</p>

<p>There’s the secret. Abraham obeyed <em>by faith</em>. So what does that mean?</p>

<p>If you were going to travel <em>by bike</em>, that means the bike is <em>how</em> you would travel. The bike is <em>what you would use</em> in order to travel. In the same way, if you were going to obey <em>by faith</em>, that means faith is <em>how</em> you would obey. Faith is how we pursue Christian obedience.</p>

<p>But how does that work?</p>

<h4>Trusting God’s Promises</h4>

<p>Faith means trusting God’s promises — trusting all that God promises to be to us in Christ Jesus. So if faith means <em>trusting God’s promises</em>, and Abraham obeyed <em>by faith</em>, that means Abraham obeyed <em>by trusting God’s promises.</em></p>

<p>We can see that this is how God wanted Abraham to obey, by noticing what God says to him. God starts with a command: “Now the Lᴏʀᴅ said to Abram, ‘Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you’” (Genesis 12:1).</p>

<p>But God follows this command with astonishing promises:</p>

<blockquote><p>“And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.” (Genesis 12:2–3)</p></blockquote>

<p>So <em>how</em> did God want Abraham to obey? Not by just focusing on the command. Not by just saying, “I’m supposed to do this. God commands me to do this. This is the right thing to do.” No. God wanted Abraham to obey <em>by faith — by trusting God’s promises.</em> God wanted the worth of his promises to so capture Abraham’s heart so that he <em>wanted</em> to obey.</p>

<h4>It’s Not Easy</h4>

<p>But that would not have been easy. One reason is because Abraham’s indwelling sin would urge him not to trust God. The other is because God’s promises were future and thus unseen to Abraham.</p>

<p>So, like all of us, Abraham would have needed to pray and ask God to strengthen his faith (Mark 9:24). He would have known that faith comes by prayerfully hearing God’s word (Romans 10:17).</p>

<p>So he would have prayed and set his heart on trusting God’s promises until the Holy Spirit strengthened his faith so he knew and felt — <em>if I obey, God will</em> . . .
• <em>make of me a great nation</em>
• <em>bless me so I will be a blessing</em>
• <em>bless those who bless me and curse those who dishonor me</em>
• <em>bless all the peoples of the earth through me (my descendant, the Messiah).</em></p>

<p>Then, when Abraham trusted all that God would do for him, he would obey —</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Sarah, God has told me something wonderful. He promises that if we go to a land he will show us, he will make of us a great nation. He will bless us and make us blessings. And he will bless the whole earth through us. Let's start packing!</em></p></blockquote>

<h4>Obeying by Faith</h4>

<p>Abraham obeyed by faith; by trusting God’s promises. But what’s shocking is that many of us try to obey without trusting God’s promises.</p>

<p>Here’s an example. Most of us are familiar with the command of Colossians 3:23 — whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men. We know that command. We’ve tried to obey that command. But have we obeyed that command by faith? Do we know the promise God attaches to that command to help us obey? If we don’t, then how can we have been obeying by faith?</p>

<p>So what’s the promise? Look at the larger context. “Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward” (Colossians 3:23–24).</p>

<p>Did you notice <em>how</em> we are to obey?  It’s by knowing — by trusting — that from the Lord we will receive the inheritance as our reward.</p>

<p>So God does not just want us to work heartily. God wants us to work heartily, because we <em>know</em> and <em>trust</em> his promise that he will mercifully reward our undeserving work with the inheritance of more joy in him forever.</p>

<h4>Lifting a Rocket Ship</h4>

<p>Imagine a huge rocket ship called Obedience. It’s made to be powered by a fuel called Promises, which is ignited by Faith. So don’t ignore the fuel of the Promises. Don’t try to lift the rocket ship of Obedience by your own power.</p>

<p>Instead, ignite the fuel of the Promises by Faith. And watch Obedience blast off.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DGBlog/~4/aMlixaA2PCI" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 10:39:00 -0500";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DGBlog/~3/aMlixaA2PCI/god-s-gracious-path-to-costly-obedience";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"desiringgod.org-blog-post-5323";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0";a:1:{s:8:"origLink";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/god-s-gracious-path-to-costly-obedience";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:19:"

(Philippians 4:8)</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Want to refresh your soul? Want to run with more endurance today? Cease to be the focus of your attention.</p>

<p>The state of your soul depends on what occupies your mind. If your self is occupying your mind, forget peace and contentment. You don’t find those in a vacuum of needs and sinful cravings. And forget loving others. A self-preoccupied soul might like the idea of being viewed by others as loving, but ends up finding others obstacles that plug up its craving vacuum.</p>

<p>And forget joy. The soul does not find satisfaction in the self. It’s not designed to. It’s designed to find supreme satisfaction in Someone else (Psalm 107:9), and then to enjoy everything else because of that Someone else (1 Timothy 6:17).</p>

<h4>The Self Will Never Satisfy the Soul</h4>

<p>The soul is designed to worship, but not to worship our self. The self is not glorious enough to captivate the soul. We know this. Yet our fallen selves don’t want to believe it. We’re drawn again and again into the hopeless labyrinth of deception that is self-worship. We know we’re not worship-worthy—no matter how many self-affirming pop psychology mantras we chant. And yet we try over and over to satisfy our souls with other people’s praise—and if possible, worship—of our self. Our fallen natures seem to believe that if enough people admire us we just might believe we’re admirable.</p>

<p>Self-preoccupation is <em>disorienting</em>, because when we’re looking at ourselves we aren’t looking to Jesus (Hebrews 12:2) and we aren’t looking at the road we are running on (Hebrews 12:1). It’s <em>disappointing</em> because we never find in ourselves what we’re looking for. Therefore, it frequently leads to <em>discouragement and despair</em>. Ironically, we are then often lured into self-centered introspection, which leads us into a vicious cycle of self-improvement efforts, self-indulgence, self-disillusionment, new self-resolves, etc., etc.</p>

<h4>How to Lay Aside the Old Self for the Sake of Joy</h4>

<p>Self-preoccupation really is a sin that “clings so closely” (Hebrews 12:1). It’s hard to lay it aside. It’s so much a part of us that we can despair of ever really changing. “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible” (Matthew 19:26). The Bible tells us how to do this:</p>

<p>1. <strong>Deny yourself</strong> by getting your eyes off yourself. But remember, Christian self-denial is hedonistic because you’re denying yourself of what robs life in order to gain life.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>“If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.” (Matthew 16:24–25)</em></p></blockquote>

<p>2. <strong>Look to Jesus</strong> (Hebrews 12:2) and all that God promises to be and do for you through him. Only he will satisfy your soul (Psalm 63:1-3) and only he has the words of eternal life (John 6:68).</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. (Colossians 3:2)</em></p>

<p><em>But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. (Matthew 6:33)</em></p>

<p><em>Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. (Philippians 4:8)</em></p></blockquote>

<p>3. <strong>Serve others.</strong> Strike a blow at self-preoccupation by focusing on others’ needs and concerns. Our Lord’s commands to love one another (John 13:34) and serve one another (John 13:14) have a double-edged benefit for us: they give us the blessing of giving and liberate us from the tyranny of self.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>“It is more blessed to give than to receive.” (Acts 20:35)</em></p>

<p><em>Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. (Philippians 2:3–4)</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Worldly hedonists believe that narcissism is the path to joy. That is a horrible lie. Christian Hedonists know that narcissism is the death of joy, because only God is our “exceeding joy” (Psalm 43:4, Psalm 16:11).</p>

<p>So join me today, for the sake of God’s joy, our joy, and others’ joy, in laying aside the weight of self-preoccupation by denying ourselves lifelessness, looking to Jesus who is our life (John 14:6), and giving life to others by serving them.</p>

<p>We have all felt this at some point in our lives. It’s the idea that we’ll discover the happiness we desire if we could only improve our circumstances. It’s actually what sparked the Women’s Movement in the 1960s, as Mary Kassian explains in this short video.</p>

<p>If women could just change their circumstances, if we could just get out of these traditional roles, “then we’d be happy.” But the fact is: women are not happier today. The happiness we long for is not “out there,” but it’s only found in a relationship with Jesus.</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>


<p>As many of you may know, the Pipers have left Minneapolis for a year to make space for the new leadership at Bethlehem. They are now settled in Tennessee, renting the home of an extended family member for the months ahead. For the first time, John is on staff full time at Desiring God, and he has plenty of travel and writing to fill his calendar as he works remotely for this season.</p>

<p>So what will John be doing? Here’s a short portion of an update and invitation he sent last week to some of our financial partners.</p>




<p><blockquote>There are over 20 speaking engagements, including three trips overseas. I’ve plunged into three book projects. The first is <em>Five Points: Towards a Deeper Experience of God’s Grace</em>. The second is <em>A Godward Heart: Treasuring the God Who Loves You</em>. Third is a new volume in the series <em>The Swans Are Not Silent</em>. I’m working on a new Bible-teaching idea for the Web that we hope to roll out during the coming year, and I record Ask Pastor John for release five days a week....</p>




<p>With our fiscal year ending June 30, we are praying toward a goal of $255,000, representing 6.2% of our $4,152,254 annual budget. That’s what we need to press on with next year’s expanded goals. Thank you for anything you are able to give. I love this ministry and feel affection for every kind of support.</p>


<p></blockquote></p>

<p>We are joyfully committed to helping people everywhere understand and embrace the truth that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him. Whether you’ve been a long-time friend of the ministry, or you’ve been newly introduced to Pastor John’s teaching, we’d love to have you <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/about/support-dg">join us in this mission</a> as we work together for the increase of joy (2 Corinthians 1:24).</p>




<p>In Christ,</p>




<p>Scott Anderson<br>
Executive Director</p>

<p>P.S. We hope that you’ll be encouraged by this video. It provides a glimpse into the Spanish translation efforts in which we are engaged through the life and ministry of one of our translators, Luis Mendez.

Strangers, friends, blogs, and books freely offer their candid encouragements. I remember one occasion years ago when I was buying a package of preschooler underpants. The store clerk smiled and said, “When you start their toilet training you’re going to feel like there’s urine everywhere. But don’t worry, you’re not alone.” The woman behind me in line echoed her. “Ain’t that the truth!” There’s no doubt about the fact that we receive a special kind of encouragement knowing we’re not alone.</p>


<p>Believers in Christ are surrounded by “so great a cloud of witnesses” who walk by faith, their lives a testimony to the ultimate grace and the greatest peace. The grace and peace these men and women know keeps them going through heart-wrenching trials and even physically-threatening ordeals. God has given them eyes of faith to see our joy-pursuing, cross-enduring, shame-despising Christ who is exalted over all things and is seated at his right hand.</p>


<p>Having been given all authority in heaven and on earth, Jesus Christ gives us our marching orders and assures us with absolute certainty that he is always with us — even to the end of the age (Matthew 28:20).</p>


<p>We’re not alone.</p>


<h4>For the Small Stuff</h4>


<p>My everyday life is not replete with dangers to body and soul around every corner. I’m more likely to encounter a sibling squabble or some kind of monument to my own homemaking procrastination when I round a corner in our home. It’s tempting to consider Christ’s presence as only available for “the big stuff.” Even though I understand my work in the home as facilitating disciple-making to the praise of God’s glory among the nations, my disparaging heart attitude about the repetitive work of ordinary life reveals these fear-filled questions: Does this matter to the Lord? Is he with me?</p>


<p>I often echo Paul’s prayer for the Ephesians and ask it for myself and for others who need encouragement. What kind of assuring joy we would know as the Lord enlightens the eyes of our hearts to know the hope to which he has called us, and the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints (Ephesians 1:18)! What kind of thrilling peace we can rest in knowing that Christ’s rock-steady presence in our lives is never, ever diminished by our foggy, shifting doubts!</p>


<p>Jesus is not absent from our domestic lives as we serve his disciple-making purposes. If he’s with you to the end of the age …</p>


<p>… then he’s with you to the end of packing the last box before a move.</p>


<p>… then he’s with you to the end of a dating relationship that is (finally!) culminating in a Christ-exalting marriage.</p>


<p>… then he’s with you to the end of the adoption paperwork when the judge declares, “Congratulations!”</p>


<p>… then he’s with you to the end of a difficult school year.</p>


<p>… then he’s with you to the end of cleaning a mess that is so profuse you’re not sure whether to laugh or cry.</p>


<p>… then he’s with you to the end of an awkward silence you’re not sure how to resolve.</p>


<p>… then he’s with you to the end of a long night awake with a colicky infant.</p>


<p>… then he’s with you to the end of the month when the budget isn’t working.</p>


<h4>Supreme Treasure</h4>


<p>Drawing comfort from Christ’s abiding presence makes all the difference in the way we live our lives in the home. Through the gospel of God, which is his very power for salvation, we have been given Christ as our supreme treasure. God’s amazing grace to us in Christ Jesus is the hope to which he has called us, and Christ himself is our glorious inheritance. Because of Jesus our lives are cups that are filled to overflowing with blessings, as John Newton so famously penned,</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The Lord has promised good to me,</p>
<p>His word my hope secures.</p>
<p>He will my shield and portion be</p>
<p>As long as life endures. (Amazing Grace)</p>
</blockquote>


<p>“As long as life endures” is but a short while, and then eternal life endures forever and ever. Christ will be our shield and portion to the end of the age ... and to the end of this week’s ironing.</p>

Rarely does one turn such manifest angst to articulation and channel such blood-earnestness into precise words.</p>

<p>Blaise Pascal burned with the kind of intensity and aggression uncharacteristic of those who have long, peaceful lives. He was a fierce flame with a short wick.</p>

<p>It was June 19, 1623 — 390 years ago now — that Pascal was born in Clermont, France, to a mother who would die when he was only a toddler. He himself would live a sickly and painful life and wouldn’t even see his fortieth birthday — though he left an indelible impression. While the world had him for less than four decades, the church only had him for eight years — from his “second conversion” in 1654 to his early death in 1662. But they were a very productive eight.</p>

<h4>Prodigy, Physicist, Philosopher</h4>

<p>His is one of the great minds of Western civilization — indeed, the history of the world. He was a child prodigy and first a mathematician and physicist, then a philosopher and theologian. A contemporary of René Descartes (1596–1650), the father of modern philosophy, Pascal was wise enough to be “the <em>only</em> philosopher until the nineteenth century who did <em>not</em> climb onto Descartes’s new methodological bandwagon” (Peter Kreeft, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0898704529?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=desigod-20"><em>Christianity for Modern Pagans</em></a>, 9).</p>

<p>If only Western philosophy en masse had Pascal’s resistance to the false prophet his fellow Frenchman has proved to be. Scoffing at Descartes’s program for certainty, utility, and ease, Pascal found him “pointless, uncertain, and arduous.”</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Descartes</em>. In general terms one must say: . . . Pointless, uncertain, and arduous. Even if it were true we do not think that the whole of philosophy would be worth an hour’s effort. (Pensées #84)</p></blockquote>

<h4>Arrows into Modern Pagan Hearts</h4>

<p>Because he refused to swallow Descartes’s pill of naively applying the scientific method to every discipline, Pascal’s seventeenth-century writings prove hauntingly relevant today in a postmodern milieu in which more and more are awakening from the Enlightenment’s folly.</p>

<blockquote><p>Pascal is the first postmedieval apologist. He is “for today” because he speaks to modern pagans, not to medieval Christians. Most Christian apologetics today is still written from a medieval mind-set in one sense: as if we still lived in a Christian culture, a Christian civilization, a society that reinforced the Gospel. No. The honeymoon is over. The Middle Ages are over. The news has not yet sunk in fully in many quarters.</p>

<p>It has sunk in to Pascal. He is three centuries ahead of his time. He addresses his apologetic to modern pagans, sophisticated skeptics, comfortable members of the new secular intelligentsia. He is the first to realize the new dechristianized, desacramentalized world and to address it. He belongs to us. . . . I know no pre-twentieth-century book except the Bible that shoots Christian arrows farther into modern pagan hearts than [Pascal’s] <em>Pensées</em>. (Kreeft, 12–13).</p></blockquote>

<h4>Pascal’s Inferno</h4>

<p>While there’s nothing especially notable about his physical birth on June 19, 1623, his seeming new birth, bursting into the spiritual world, came in a blaze of glory he simply called “Fire.”</p>

<p>It was November 23, 1654. He was 31 years old. For two hours, from about 10:30 PM until 12:30 AM, he experienced a kind of spiritual inferno. He journaled the experience on a piece of a paper he sewed into his coat to keep near his heart.</p>

<blockquote><p>Fire.<br/>
“God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob,” not of philosophers and scholars.<br/>
Certainty, certainty, heartfelt, joy, peace.<br/>
God of Jesus Christ.<br/>
God of Jesus Christ. . . .<br/>
Joy, joy, joy, tears of joy. . . .<br/>
“And this is eternal life, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.”<br/>
Jesus Christ.<br/>
Jesus Christ. . . .</p></blockquote>

<p>Some call it his “second conversion,” but it very well may have been his first. From then on, Pascal was a different man. He would be dead before age 39, but the next eight years were given to an entirely fresh Godward orientation of his intellect and vocation.</p>

<h4>Pascal’s Wager</h4>

<p>The most famous of his ideas is “the wager.” It’s an attempt to appeal to the unbeliever who might be interested in the faith and to the believing who are weak in faith. Neither those who were dead set against God’s existence, or those fully convinced of it, would have much to gain from his “gamble.” But he hoped such reasoning might find traction with those in the middle.</p>

<p>The essence of the wager is that it is wiser to “bet” on God existing, live accordingly, and end up being wrong than to “bet” that God doesn’t exist and find out in the end that he does. He develops it most fully in <em>pensée</em> #233 (in <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pascal/pensees.toc.html">Trotter’s translation</a>), but there’s a short summary angle on “the wager” in #241: “I should be much more afraid of being mistaken and then finding out that Christianity is true than of being mistaken in believing it to be true.” Kreeft comments,</p>

<blockquote><p>The Wager is not an attempt to prove that God exists. It is not a new argument for the existence of God. Rather, it tries to prove that it is eminently reasonable for anyone to “bet” on God, to <em>hope</em> that God is, to invest his life in God. It moves on the practical, existential, human level rather than the theoretical, metaphysical, theological level. (291)</p></blockquote>

<h4>Pascal’s <em>Pensées</em></h4>

<p>Three times now we’ve quoted from the <em>Pensées</em>, his most important work, which deserves at least a brief explanation. <em>Pensées</em> is French for “thoughts.” When Pascal died in 1662, he was hard at work on his magnum opus, to be titled <em>Apology for the Christian Religion</em>. He left hundreds of fragments of his thoughts — some longer and likely near completion, and others shorter and more rudimentary. After his death, his “thoughts” were assembled and published in 1669. This is what we know as the <em>Pensées</em>.</p>

<p>One more of Pascal’s thoughts worth giving special note to is #425 (<a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pascal/pensees.toc.html">Trotter’s translation</a>). Twice in the opening pages of <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/books/desiring-god"><em>Desiring God</em></a>, John Piper quotes from this important <em>pensée</em> through which he was making seminal discoveries about God’s wiring us for satisfaction in him. The first is “all men seek happiness.”</p>

<blockquote><p>All men seek happiness. This is without exception. Whatever different means they employ, they all tend to this end. The cause of some going to war, and of others avoiding it, is the same desire in both, attended with different views. The will never takes the least step but to this object. This is the motive of every action of every man, even of those who hang themselves.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second is “the infinite abyss.”</p>

<blockquote><p>There was once in man a true happiness of which there now remain to him only the mark and empty trace, which he in vain tries to fill from all his surroundings, seeking from things absent the help he does not obtain in things present? But these are all inadequate, because the infinite abyss can only be filled by an infinite and immutable object, that is to say, only by God Himself.</p></blockquote>

<p>(For more on how Pascal and C.S. Lewis conspired for a powerful modern-day apologetic for Piper, see <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/books/desiring-god"><em>Desiring God</em></a>, pages 19–21.)</p>

<h4>Struck Dead in Infinite Mercy</h4>

<p>Pascal died August 19, 1662, on the heels of a long, painful illness. The church might think it a tragedy to lose such a one at this young age, but Kreeft glimpses a divine mercy.</p>

<blockquote><p>In 1662 God in his infinite mercy struck Pascal dead at the tender age of thirty-nine, before he could complete the greatest book of Christian apologetics ever written.</p>

<p>We stand stupefied most of the time at the way God runs the world; but occasionally we get a hint, a little lifting of the curtain and a glimpse backstage. I think we have such a glimpse here. Why didn’t God let Pascal finish the book for which the <em>pensées</em> are only the scattered notes, like a scholar’s storm-struck study? Everyone who reads the <em>pensées</em> can sense the reason: they are too lively, too <em>alive</em>, to be contained in a book. (10)</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether Pascal’s thoughts are too alive to be contained in a completed book or not, you’ll have to judge. Read Pascal’s <em>Pensées</em> for yourself (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0898704529?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=desigod-20">Kreeft’s “festooning”</a> is a good place to start or <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pascal/pensees.toc.html">Trotter’s translation online</a> — or T.S. Eliot’s translation, currently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0082ST3K0?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=desigod-20">free on Kindle</a>), and feel the warmth firsthand from a blaze still strong enough to warm the hearts of modern pagans and Christians alike, just in time for the challenges of the twenty-first century.</p>

<p>There is truth in saying, “love is a choice” or “love is a decision.” It is true that if you don’t feel like doing good to your neighbor love will incline you to “choose” to do it anyway. If you feel like getting a divorce, love will incline you to “choose” to stay married and work it out.</p>

<p>If you shrink back from the pain of nails being driven through your hands, love will incline you to say, “Not my will but yours be done.” That’s the truth I hear in the statements: “Love is a choice,” or “Love is a decision.”</p>

<p>But I don’t prefer to use these statements. Too many people hear three tendencies in them that those who use the statements may not intend.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Saying “love is a choice” sounds like the tendency to believe love is in our power to perform, even when we don’t feel like it.</p></li>
<li><p>Saying “love is a choice” sounds like the tendency to make the will, with its decisions, the decisive moral agent rather than the heart, with its affections.</p></li>
<li><p>Saying “love is a choice” sounds like the tendency to set the bar too low: If you can will to treat someone well, you have done all you should.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I disagree with all three of these tendencies.</p>

<p>In their place I would say:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Both at the level of desiring to do good, and the level of willing the good we don’t desire, we are totally dependent on the decisive grace of God. All that honors Christ — both affections and choices — are gifts to fallen sinners (1 Corinthians 4:7; Galatians 5:22).</p></li>
<li><p>Beneath the will, with its decisions, there is the heart, which produces our preferences, and these preferences guide the will. “The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks” (Luke 6:45).</p></li>
<li><p>If our love is only a choice, it is not yet what it ought to be.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Here are some of the verses from Scripture that cause me to shrink back from the statement, “Love is a choice,” or “love is a decision.”</p>

<h4>God’s love for his people is more than a decision.</h4>

<blockquote><p>“The Lᴏʀᴅ will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing” (Zephaniah 3:17).</p>

<p>“I [the Lᴏʀᴅ] will rejoice in doing them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul” (Jeremiah 32:41).</p>

<p>“As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you” (Isaiah 62:5).</p>

<p>“How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel?. . . My compassion grows warm and tender” (Hosea 11:8).</p></blockquote>

<h4>Our love for God is more than a decision.</h4>

<blockquote><p>“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind” (Matthew 22:37).</p>

<p>“There is laid up for me the crown of righteousness . . . for all who have loved his appearing” (2 Timothy 4:8). (That is we long for Jesus to be here; we desire him.)</p></blockquote>

<h4>Our love for fellow believers is more than a decision.</h4>

<blockquote><p>“Love one another with brotherly affection” (Romans 12:10).</p>

<p>“Love one another earnestly from a pure heart” (1 Peter 1:22).</p>

<p>“Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you” (Ephesians 4:31–32). (These affectional dimensions are what it means to “walk in love” according to Ephesians 5:2.)</p>

<p>“Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians 9:7).</p>

<p>“Love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant . . . It is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth” (1 Corinthians 13:4–7).</p></blockquote>

<h4>Our love for our enemies is more than a decision.</h4>

<blockquote><p>“But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you” (Matthew 5:44). (A prayer for our enemy to be blessed without a heartfelt desire that he be blessed is hypocrisy.)</p></blockquote>

<p>It is important to hear me say, “<em>more</em> than a decision.” I am not denying there are crucial choices and decisions to be made in a life of love. I am not denying that those choices and decisions are part of what love <em>is</em>. So I am not saying the statements “love <em>is</em> a choice” or “love <em>is</em> a decision,” are false.</p>

<p>But I am jealous that the richness and depth (and human impossibility) of what love is in the Bible not be lost. Hence this little pushback.</p>

These are like reflexes. You don’t choose them. They spring up unintentionally from your heart, usually in response to the people around you.</p>

<p>It may be anger, anxiety, envy, resentment, self-pity, disgust, frustration, discouragement, lust, irritability, impatience, hard-heartedness, brusqueness, unkindness, withdrawnness.</p>

<p>When any one of these attitudes springs up unbidden, you hate it. You have fought it for years with gospel-faithfulness, trusting in the blood of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit to cover it and conquer it.</p>

<p>Still it returns. You weep over it, and ask your closest friends to pray for you. There is a short season of reprieve. And there it is again stamping you. Telling you: <em>This is who you are</em>. You say no. <em>In Christ, this is not who I am. His stamp is on my life</em>. True. But O you would be done with this! O to be new, through and through! Not in such a limited way.</p>

<p>Is there a remedy? Is there a key?</p>

<p>No. There are a thousand.</p>

<p>The point of this post is to remind us that “<em>every</em> Scripture is profitable for training in righteousness” so that we might be “complete, equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:16–17). <em>Every</em> verse is profitable. Thousands of them.</p>

<h4>Do Not Give Up</h4>

<p>In other words, you don’t know what word of God will suddenly (or gradually) be used by the Holy Spirit to give the long-awaited victory. God has his reasons for why he allows us to fight so long. But he never intends us to give up on Scripture.</p>

<p>Owen wrote his <em>Mortification of Sin</em>. Ryle wrote his <em>Holiness</em>. Bridges has written his <em>Transforming Power of the Gospel.</em> Chapell his <em>Holiness by Grace</em>. Piper his <em>Future Grace</em>. And when they are all done, hundreds of verses remain untouched and profitable. God has said so much more than any of us has said.</p>

<p>Don’t give up the fight. God’s designs are to bring a surprising verse into your heart in a surprising moment in a surprising situation and do a surprising work of transformation.</p>

<h4>The Immeasurable Moment</h4>

<p>For example, you may be reading one morning and see for the hundredth time Psalm 90:12, “So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom.” And in a way that never happened before you feel how utterly short and fragile and uncertain and precious your life is. You feel, as never before, the connection between a wise way of life and the shortness of life.</p>

<p>And in that surprising awareness of death — that deeply felt awareness — you recall what James says about wisdom. You have never made this connection before in your whole life. You recall that James says, “the wisdom from above is gentle and full of mercy” (James 3:17).</p>

<p>Then you sense what God is doing. All your life, you have struggled with being harsh rather than gentle. Your reflexes are not merciful. And now, God is touching you at a place you have never been touched before. He’s making a connection in your heart that you have never made before. The connection between your coming death and your unkindness.</p>

<h4>Awakened to a New Possibility</h4>

<p>And the point is not that after death you will have to give an account. That’s true. But that is not what God is doing now. He is awakening in you a new possibility of life. He is opening you to a kind of gentleness and peace and kindness that could actually begin to feel natural to you. The shadow of your death is softening you. The numbering of your days is shaping in you a humble, gentle, heavenly wisdom. Your heart is actually softening.</p>

<p>This long-standing struggle with the reflexes of hard-heartedness, and unmercifulness, is suddenly (or gradually) different. Death is doing a strange and sweetening and wonderful work.</p>

<p>Will it last? Perhaps. If not, there are 999 more verses waiting to do their surprising work. You do not know what victories await. Read on. Pray on. Believe all things. Hope all things. “<em>Every</em> Scripture” is profitable. God is not done with you.</p>

<p>“O Lᴏʀᴅ, make me know my end and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting I am!” (Psalm 39:4).</p>

This simply means that ebooks are still on the rise. More and more users like to carry their libraries in their hands. And this matters for the mission of Desiring God.</p>

<p>Though it won’t replace good old-fashioned books, the upward trend of ebooks has created a new platform for us to spread our message — that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.</p>

<p>Over the past year we’ve created 14 new titles exclusively released as ebooks, all free, available in three different file formats to fit whichever mobile device you use. They have included specially curated content from John Piper on particular topics, reformatted single messages, combined articles from leading pastors, and foundational teaching from Piper’s corpus, along with introductory sections written entirely new. The topics range from how to listen to sermons to advice on marriage to the influence of C.S. Lewis.</p>

<h4>The Current List</h4>

<p>Below is the full list of our ebook exclusives over the past year. More are in the works. Here’s a chance to download the ones you may have missed, and a chance to help us get the word out if you’d like. Thank you for your reading and partnership!</p>

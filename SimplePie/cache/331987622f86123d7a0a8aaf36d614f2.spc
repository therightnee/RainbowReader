</p> <p class="p1"><i>With <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/situation-critical/">Situation Critical</a>, we present artists with various life situations-- some joyous, some terrible, some bizarre-- to find out which songs, albums, or bands they would turn to under those specific circumstances. This time, we spoke with eclectic singer/songwriter <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30204-father-john-misty/">Father John Misty</a>, who is currently <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/51341-father-john-misty-expands-tour/">on tour</a> in support of his 2012 album </i><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16597-fear-fun/">Fear Fun</a><i>.</i></p> <hr /> <p class="p1"><b>You're in the car with your grandparents...</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>My grandparents are dead, so I'd probably put on "Monster Mash".</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/AxcM3nCsglA?rel=0" width="624" height="468" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1"><b>You're DJ'ing your best friend's wedding...</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Justin Bieber's "That Should Be Me".

When you’re on a flight, things start to get very existential very quickly: “Why the fuck am I doing this?” Sometimes, the most counterintuitively comforting thought on a long plane ride is that I have a lot more plane rides to take in my life before it’s all done.</p> <p class="p1">The worst part of any flight is going through customs-- like when you reach into your backpack in Australia and realize you’ve brought a glass pipe from home with you. The worst flight that I’ve ever been on was when I was flying into Chicago in a snowstorm three years ago to make a record with <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6367-steve-albini/">Steve Albini</a>. There was a power outage, all the lights went out, the plane dipped really quickly, and everyone screamed, “We’re dying now.” When the lights came back on, it was one of those collective human moments where everyone was taking stock of whether or not they wanted to keep living. The worst part was that, around this time, I was having this really disturbing peace about dying, so that was an undesired moment of staring into the mirror. I always respond to trauma like that by eating, so when the flight landed, I had a cab take me straight to [deep-dish pizza chain] Giordano’s. I sat in a booth soaking wet, staring into the distance, joylessly consuming an entire pizza.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/6sxX2clORqI?rel=0" width="624" height="468" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1"><b>You're using your parents' computer and can only listen to music via YouTube...</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>I'm still not allowed to use the computer at my parents' house due to the pornography I looked at in high school. I still have to ask them for the password and then deal with their sigh of consternation. But I would probably show them clips of myself, to convince them that I’m doing something worthwhile with my life.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/n6ubw2XzxsM?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1"><b>You're sick with the flu...</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>It's tough for me to find something to focus on when I'm in that nauseous state. I was profoundly hung over the other morning, and there were all of these books by my bed that I had to turn around, because I can’t even read words when I’m nauseous. Maybe I'd listen to side B of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/">Neil Young</a>'s <i>On the Beach</i>.</p> <p class="p1">I got real sick in Paris one time, to the point where I had to drop off a tour and stay there for three days. That was pretty brutal, especially because there are so many alien smells in Paris. Especially in grocery stores-- they’re not as addicted to the smell of antibacterial goo in Europe as we are here. One time, I gave myself alcohol poisoning a couple of days in a row, and I completely wiped all the sodium out of my body. I had to go to the hospital, and they brought in four different people to take my blood because they couldn’t believe it. They were like, "You have the blood sodium level of a sick 80-year-old woman." That was definitely the worst I’ve ever felt-- even crying in pain took too much energy.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CKgj1FNToWY?rel=0" width="624" height="468" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1"><b>You're about to play music for your newborn child for the first time...</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>I'd play some <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/24824-plastic-ono-band/">Plastic Ono Band</a> and be like, “This is what you’re in for, motherfucker.

When I was 20, I dropped out of school, moved to Octavia, New York-- which is in the middle of nowhere-- and worked at a Pizza Hut for six months. I ended up giving away 100 free pizzas because I refused to ask people if they wanted to take advantage of whatever promotions they were offering at the time. I was also a session drummer in Buffalo-- just these terrible session gigs where people would come in with their demos and me and this guy played bass for them. I was like, “Why did I drop out of college?” [<i>laughs</i>]</p> <p class="p1">So I had this mile-long walk home through snowy farmland in a Pizza Hut outfit. This was in the time of the Discman, when you'd have one album at your disposal and you'd shoehorn all of your experiences into the aesthetic of that album, which could be very satisfying.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RDRDH0u0Ptc?rel=0" width="624" height="468" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1"><b>You're settling down for some light reading...</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>I don’t do any light reading. I only do <i>heavy</i> reading, and I don’t like to listen to music when I’m reading. But if I was reading <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, I might listen to the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> soundtrack. I remember when I was reading <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/">Miles Davis</a>' autobiography, I was more or less listening to his discography chronologically as I was going along with the book. I would play a game where, any time in the book that Miles did heroin, I'd do heroin.

I like watching people when that one's on, because when they hear the saxophone solo, they assume that they know exactly what they’re in for. But that tune has this really bizarre way of sneaking up on you. I like to coerce people into liking things before they’re prepared to.</p> <p class="p1">My best game at bowling was upwards of... 70. Without bumpers. My first game is always incredible, and then I start playing head games with myself and lose. When I worked construction, I used to bowl all the time. That was when you could smoke in the bowling alley.

</p> <p><i><small>Photos by <a href="http://www.mikaelgregorsky.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mikael Gregorsky</a></small></i></p> <p class="p1">There is no sign above the door of the studio where Archy Marshall, aka <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29959-king-krule/" target="_blank">King Krule</a>, is recording his debut album, the upcoming <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/51450-king-krule-announces-debut-album-6-feet-beneath-the-moon-shares-easy-easy/"><i>6 Feet Beneath the Moon</i></a>. The place is tucked away on a backstreet in South London and, thanks to that blank exterior, looks more like an abandoned storeroom. Inside is a different story: It’s compact but full of gear, including an old upright organ in the hallway that Marshall heads straight for after strolling in a little late, banging out an abrupt melody before nodding a hello. </p> <p class="p1">The night before our interview in late April, Marshall hosted a show on <a href="http://rinse.fm/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rinse FM</a>, introducing tracks by Afrobeat legend <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/">Fela Kuti</a>, "Back in the Day" 90s rapper <a href="http://youtu.be/q0WMSovOboY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ahmad</a>, UK post-punk act <a href="http://youtu.be/nonGWDxcJNA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The The</a>, and his own "casual" hip-hop side project <a href="http://edgarthebeatmaker.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edgar the Beatmaker</a> in that yawning London drawl of his. There’s a humble eloquence to the lines that Marshall traces between the times with his music selections, a respectful stance that resounds throughout his own productions including <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16011-king-krule/">his breakout 2011 EP</a> and last year's <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14055-rock-bottom/">"Rock Bottom"</a>/<a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14270-octopus/">"Octopus"</a> single.</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/kk6242.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p1">In conversation, he seems older than his 18 years. (Marshall turns 19 on August 24, the same day his album will be released.) There are no monosyllabic answers or any of the sentence buffers that pepper his contemporaries’ speech. While he’s way too laid-back to be overly earnest, <i>6 Feet Beneath the Moon</i> has clearly been a very serious pursuit. After spending time pursuing a variety of one-offs-- mixtapes from his beat-driven project <a href="https://soundcloud.com/djjdsports" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DJ JD Sports</a>, Edgar the Beatmaker, a support gig for retro NYC rap act <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30729-ratking/">Ratking</a> for which he provided breezy 90s beats for his friend Rago Foot to spit over, a <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/50755-listen-mount-kimbie-featuring-king-krule-you-took-your-time/">collaboration</a> with electronic duo <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28459-mount-kimbie/">Mount Kimbie</a>-- he's buckling down, even canceling a string of UK gigs to focus on the record.</p> <p class="p1">The bits of it that I get to hear peel back the bruised teenage portrait that his 2011 EP painted to reveal the alert and engaged young man at the helm of those Rinse shows. Sauntering through jazz, hip-hop, and post-punk, he whips up stinging personal stories with startling lyrical dexterity, as heard on first single "Easy Easy", below. “I like the quick satisfaction of getting your point across in two lines,” he says, calling himself a poet and dismissing his early lyrics as “shit.” Marshall knows he’s stepped up and he hopes everyone else will realize it, too. </p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9i35KOGBYBo?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p3"><b><b>Pitchfork:</b> What sort of sounds have you been working with for this album?</b></p> <p class="p1">King Krule: I’ve mainly been sampling jazz because the tone of the chords are expressive in itself, so it’s quite nice to write over. It’s got interpretations of a lot of different genres, too, a lot of dubby-ness and experimental stuff. Just fucking around with a lot of weird equipment: an organ, a synth by EMF which is some crazy thing that you can run vocals through and make it sound like you’re in a tiny box, Moogs, Moog Phasers, Wasp distorters. Tape delays and super-echoes to get that get that more dubby, live feel. I’ve just been recording a lot of stuff and seeing what works.</p> <p class="p3"><b><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/kk6244.jpg" alt="" /></b></p> <p class="p3"><b>Pitchfork: Based on your music as well as your radio selections, you seem to have a knack for making connections between disparate genres and eras.</b></p> <p class="p1">KK: It’s just me being into sampling and seeing how a lot of really good producers have made some of their best work from a 10-second sample. When I was younger I used to do that a lot: I would hear a part of a song that would really relax me and then put it on repeat. That would send me to sleep. It was quite obvious classical music, people like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_Cafe_Orchestra" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Penguin Cafe Orchestra</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/13319-erik-satie/">Erik Satie</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Debussy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Claude Debussy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Ravel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maurice Ravel</a>.  </p> <p class="p3"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/kk6243.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p3"><b><b>Pitchfork:</b> Lyrically, you often pick away at the struggle of living. Is that something you're consciously trying to do?</b></p> <p class="p1">KK: Definitely. All the issues I address are within myself, it’s what comes naturally. It’s a reaction to something that’s just happened; it’s good to write down your opinion on it. I like setting scenes and then delving in and concluding it somehow. All the subject matter comes from something that has happened. It’s a very nice release. </p> <p class="p3">I just like documenting my perspective as well, because then if something else happens in the situation that changes your perspective, it’s good to have something there to remind you of that period in time. Documentation’s cool; I like that.</p> <p class="p3"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/kk6245.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p3">
Mount Kimbie: &quot;You Took Your Time&quot; [ft.

It was really good to build that relationship. Then they introduced me to [this studio]-- they started recording stuff down here. They did all the music to this one track, which really inspired me to write something quite dark over the top, because I was going through some dark things during that period of time. It was good to have that release, especially because I wanted to work on that album. I’ve loved their stuff for such a long time. I really liked having an input on it, lyrically. I want to do it live as well. </p> <p class="p3"><b><b>Pitchfork: </b>Your songwriting is so strong and of its own mind, do you feel connected to songwriters from other eras?</b></p> <p class="p1">KK: Yeah. Sometimes I’ll listen to a lyric and I’ll be so pissed off that I didn’t write it. [<i>laughs</i>] </p> <p class="p3"><b><b>Pitchfork: </b>Like what?</b></p> <p class="p1">KK: Like every <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/">OutKast</a> track. That’s the shit. And there’s this one track, “When Your Lover Has Gone”-- I think it comes from a musical-- but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Freshmen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Four Freshman</a> did it in 1959. <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/0m8a6AcGr1K7FWIoz0vyAu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">That version of the song</a> is really something I wish I’d wrote.</p>

</p> <p class="p1"><i><small>Photos by Ari Marcopoulos</small></i></p> <p class="p1"><a href="http://arimarcopoulos.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ari Marcopoulos</a>' artistic philosophy is sneakily simple. "If you show interest in something somebody does, most people are quite open," the 56-year-old tells me over the phone from his Brooklyn home. This is how he's managed to capture endless reams of candid, off-the-cuff photos of hip-hop legends, athletes, his own family, and complete strangers for more than three decades. Listening to the Holland native speak in a series of excitable jags over the course of an hour, it becomes clear how he's able to get people to let their guard down: It's easy to trust someone who deeply cares about their work.</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/arischoolyd624.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p1"><i><small>Schoolly D</small></i></p> <p class="p1">After moving to New York in 1979, he became fascinated with the city's burgeoning rap scene, from the fat laces he saw on the 6 train, to the hypnotic bass making its way downtown. "There was nothing cooler than going to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxy_NYC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Roxy</a> and seeing <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/581-afrika-bambaataa/">Afrika Bambaataa</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1852-grandmaster-flash/">Grandmaster Flash</a>, or <a href="http://youtu.be/S86qGS3dSsU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fantasy Three</a>," he recalls. "It was the best music I’d ever heard." That passion led to impromptu meetings with <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/10584-ll-cool-j/">LL Cool J</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/">Public Enemy</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3617-run-dmc/">Run-D.M.C.</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/22091-schoolly-d/">Schoolly D</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/">the Beastie Boys</a>, and others. (A book of his Beasties shots, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1576871088" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Pass the Mic</i></a>, was published in 2001.) But how did this tiny white guy from across the Atlantic ingratiate himself to the kings of 80s rap? Simple: talking to people, making connections, showing interest. "I studied and learned," he says. "Before I met Public Enemy, I had read Malcolm X’s biography and knew about Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. I was able to talk about those things."</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/arikrschuck624.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p1"><i><small>KRS-One and Public Enemy's Chuck D</small></i></p> <p class="p1">So when <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/">Jay-Z</a> reached out to him to shoot the artwork for <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18247-jay-z-magna-carta-holy-grail/"><i>Magna Carta Holy Grail</i></a>-- a connection likely inspired by Marcopoulos' 2012 book <a href="http://www.andrewroth.com/publications/ari-marcopoulos-out-to-lunch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Out to Lunch</i></a>, which includes <a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/80a270d6da16e813a4c21cfe98792ab1/tumblr_mp4j2hd49T1qd7efxo3_1280.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a spread featuring Jean-Michel Basquiat and Rakim on opposite sides of the spine</a>-- he was naturally excited by the prospect. He ended up shooting all of the photos for the album's booklet as well as the cover, which shows <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/120013623" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Italian sculptor Battista di Domenico Lorenzi's 16th century sculpture <i>Alpheus and Arethusa</i></a>, taken at Manhattan's <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>. And while his cover subject was quite literally set in stone, Marcopoulos still manages to give it life through angles, composition, and breathing greys. The image may be a far cry from the round-the-way kids in Lee jeans and shell toes he shot in the 80s, but it's still quintessentially New York, just another stop on the 6 train. (All black-and-white photos below are featured in the <i>Magna Carta Holy Grail </i>booklet.)</p> <p class="p2"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/magnabook6242.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: What was it like working with Jay-Z on this project?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>Ari Marcopoulos: When dealing in advertising, or commercial work, or album-cover work, my experience is that you’re not really involved in the decision process. But this felt more like a commission, a true collaboration. He wasn’t overbearing. I wasn't just filling in the squares. It was one artist asking another artist to help him, to create something for him. The cover image was a result of the conversations I had with him about the record and its lyrics. He sat down across from me and basically explained the album, song by song, then he rapped each one a cappella-- that was definitely something to remember for me. But it was also a dialogue. I’m comfortable speaking my mind, I don’t care who I’m with. So I listened to the music, created a list, and then went around for a week shooting. </p> <p class="p2"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/magnabook624.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: How did you end up taking the cover shot at the Met?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>AM: The Met is a classic New York institution. Almost all the pictures in the booklet were shot in New York. That was important. We just wanted to represent the city. I love New York. I live in Brooklyn. I’m a Knicks fan. And if you’re really a New Yorker, you know you can get into the Met by just paying a penny-- even though the suggested donation is $25. And the idea that you can go to that place and see such rich culture basically for free makes it much more open and much more New York. I’m always surprised when I go with people and they say, “How much is it to get into the Met?” I’m like, “Dude, you can pay what you want.” It’s a little bit of a litmus test. [<i>laughs</i>] </p> <p class="p2"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/magnacovblanke.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: What drew you to that one sculpture in particular?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>AM: Thinking of the album title and issues of power, passion, and duality-- he talks about how people that love you can also hurt you most-- I first went to the Greco-Roman section at the Met. But there wasn’t much drama to those sculptures, they were more straightforward. So I went to the later periods in European sculpture and saw that sculpture from Florence called <i>Alpheus Arethusa</i> by Battista di Domenico Lorenzi.</p> <p class="p2">I like how one person is turning away, but he has his arm reaching around-- even though they’re together, they’re also going away from each other. For me, the album is about this duality: being rich and figuring out how you can help others in a good way, and not just handing money out. Like: If you give a bum five dollars and he gets drugs or beer, did you actually do him right? Or do you find a more structural way of helping people with the money that you have? I had a hard time because I don’t really work with visual puns or metaphors in my work, but I tried to get at that with the cover. It's an ambiguous image.</p> <p class="p2"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/magnabook6245.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: It invites many different interpretations, like a Rorschach test.</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>AM: Exactly. It’s open-ended, but it has drama to it. And I photographed it in the same way I usually take pictures-- I react very quickly to things. I didn’t go up there and take a whole roll of film of this sculpture. I took one picture of it. I didn’t spend hours at the Met either. I was there for maybe 30 minutes. I just looked around, saw the sculpture, looked up at it, boom, picture. Done. Very fast.</p> <p class="p2">But it wasn’t like I took that picture and was like, “This is the cover.” I worked on the selection process with [graphic designer] <a href="http://brianroettinger.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brian Roettinger</a>-- he does graphics for <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5313-no-age/">No Age</a>-- and <a href="http://www.amoveocompany.com/willo-perron/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Willo Perron</a>, the album's creative director. In the end, I felt that was the image that should be on the front. When we presented it to Jay, he immediately was like, “Yes.” He loved it. And then he took another image of a different sculpture and said, "Maybe this is better." But within minutes he was like, “Naw, naw, naw-- the cover is the original image that you put there.” For me, that affirmed that this truly was a collaboration, a two-way street. </p> <p class="p2"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/magnabook6246.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: Do you think Samsung's involvement with the roll-out of this album somehow lessens the art therein?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>AM: No. For me, I’ve never done anything on this scale before. Trust me, whether it's Samsung, Apple, Nokia, or whatever, all these huge companies-- I don’t prefer one or the other. Some of them do great things, some of them do not-so-great things. But in the end, when I went down to Times Square and saw my giant photo of Jay-Z on the NASDAQ building, it didn’t look like a product that Samsung made, it looked like <i>my</i> product. I was proud and happy and excited to see my picture there. And if some people consider that selling out, that’s fine by me. I know what I did.</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/magnanast.jpg" alt="" /></p>

</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>A couple of years ago, when I had one of those desk jobs where you have time to sit around and read the internet all day, I had two favorite pastimes: reading articles about "millennials," and cringing at them. Like a lot of my peers, I&#8217;ve always had an uncomfortable relationship with the M-word, and even now my fingers cramp up when I try to type it without a protective force field of scare quotes. I don't think I've ever met anyone who self-identifies as a "millennial," and when people my age (26) hear that word, it generally strikes us as a story being written without our consent-- like a cheesy made-for-TV movie about our lives.&#160;</span>But, with or without our approval, it seems like a new one of these articles crops up every other day, an endless series of jabs at the pause button, each one trying to capture a more perfectly composed freeze-frame of <i>right now</i>. They are usually written by people from previous generations and published in places like&#160;<i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> and <i>Time</i>; I even have a recollection of one in Amtrak&#8217;s seatback magazine, illustrated by a dynamic photo of a Cool Millennial Dude in sneakers and a business suit, breakdancing on a conference table.</p> <p dir="ltr"><span> I remember this last one vividly, because I read it on a momentous occasion: the first business trip of my &#8220;adult&#8221; life. In this case, the scare quotes are there to indicate that I had to sheepishly phone home and borrow money from my parents to front the cost of the train ticket until my office reimbursed me. And yet, even as I sat there acting out a real-life Lena Dunham punchline, I still remember coming to the end of this Amtrak article about &#8220;millennials in the workplace&#8221; and thinking: &#8220;This isn&#8217;t me, exactly.&#8221;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/Screen%20Shot%202013-07-09%20at%203.30.46%20PM.png" alt="" width="620"><br></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>This was the year, let's call it 2010, that I first felt my sense of time breaking down completely. It was, not coincidentally, the first year I had a desk job and thus the first year I spent eight-plus hours a day in front of a screen. The days lapsed in disorienting flickers in the bottom right hand of my screen: 9:51 a.m. turning to 12:33 p.m. and how did it get to be 5:36 p.m. in what seemed like a couple of blinks. But even when I looked up from my monitor, a shift seemed to be happening on a larger scale, too. For one thing, the nostalgia cycle was all out of whack. The 90s were back, but simultaneously so were the 80s, and the 70s, and the 60s-- </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPKe9OfWs-M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>and the 1890s</span></a><span>. Mythic records and out-of-print cult movies I'd spent half my life searching for were now available in a single, anticlimactic click, and the </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2pt2-F2j2g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>Willy Wonka-brite</span></a><span> buffet of the internet meant that everybody was gorging on the recent past, but perhaps at the expense of the now. The wheels of time started to resemble a jammed cassette: The past was coiling over on itself in such a tangle that it didn&#8217;t feel like there was much room for the present. And maybe that was part of the reason why I found the vague idea of &#8220;millennials&#8221; so difficult to identify with, to claim as my own.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Accordingly, as a music fan, 2010 was the year I really started to worry that we were losing the thread. It was easy to say what 1991 or 1994 or even 1999 &#8220;sounded like,&#8221; but what did 2010 sound like? Even in retrospect, would it have any solid identity? Did it need to? In time, would the expectation of &#8220;progress&#8221; become an outdated relic? Music critic Simon Reynolds&#8217; 2011 book </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Retromania-Pop-Cultures-Addiction-Past/dp/0865479941" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Retromania</i></a><span> thoughtfully took up these and plenty of related questions, and though his tone was encouragingly hopeful (spoiler-- the last line of the book: &#8220;I still believe the future is out there&#8221;), I just as often found myself mulling over a quote he included from the computer scientist Jaron Lanier&#8217;s polemic </span><i>You Are Not a Gadget</i><span>: &#8220;Play me some music that is characteristic of the late 2000s as opposed to the late 1990s.&#8221; I constantly updated a mental list of things I&#8217;d play Lanier to prove him wrong-- Nicki Minaj! Flying Lotus! The Weeknd! Rustie! Frank Ocean! Grimes!-- but the truth is that deep down, exhausted by unimaginative revivalists and photocopied nostalgia, a skeptical voice nagged in my head almost constantly: </span><i>Maybe it&#8217;s true.

The article&#8217;s title was a play on a song he proposed as a kind of generational anthem, a track off <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/">Vampire Weekend</a>&#8217;s 2008 <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11058-vampire-weekend/">debut album</a>, &#8220;The Kids Don&#8217;t Stand a Chance&#8221;.</p> <p dir="ltr">The term &#8220;millennial&#8221; was around when Vampire Weekend put out that first record (it actually goes all the way back to 2000, when Neil Howe and William Strauss published the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0375707190" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Millennials Rising</i></a>), but it wasn&#8217;t nearly as ubiquitous or exhaustively debated as it is right now. In this moment of SEO-crazed &#8220;content creation&#8221; and clickbait contrarianism, millennials have become <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/food-nutrition/facts/is-milk-good-for-you.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>the new milk</span></a>: one minute their iconoclasm and disillusionment and dogged self-aggrandizement is good for society, the next they&#8217;re said to be corroding its very skeleton with their selfies and parents&#8217;-basement apartments and inextinguishable sense of entitlement. (Somehow the exclamatory title of this recent Salon op-ed speaks volumes about thinkpiece fatigue:<a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/05/25/i_dont_hate_millennials_anymore/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Hate Millennials Anymore!&#8221;</a>) So earlier this year when Vampire Weekend put out their third album&#160;<a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17963-vampire-weekend-modern-vampires-of-the-city/"><i>Modern Vampires of the City</i></a>-- a record that dares not only to take the Lord&#8217;s name in vain but to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-BznQE6B8U" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>pitch-shift it</span></a>, and to deliver such shruggingly anthemic lines as &#8220;I&#8217;m not excited, but should I be?/ Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?&#8221;-- it&#8217;s no wonder that fans and critics alike were going to <a href="http://nation.time.com/2013/05/09/poll-whos-the-most-influential-millennial/slide/vampire-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">try</a> to make the M-word stick to it.</p> <p dir="ltr">And I&#8217;m not sure which surprises me more: the fact that the band hasn&#8217;t really tried to shake the word off (when faced with the term &#8220;millennial unease&#8221; in a recent <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9125-vampire-weekend/">Pitchfork interview</a>,&#160;frontman Ezra Koenig replied with a laugh: &#8220;I like that phrase. It&#8217;s a concise way to describe a lot of the feelings on the album.&#8221;), or the fact that talking about this record has marked one of the first times in my life that I don&#8217;t feel entirely icky using it. Maybe that&#8217;s because-- although it&#8217;s obviously meticulously crafted-- <i>Modern Vampires</i>' aphorisms feel so nonchalant that their resonance comes off like a happy accident. It&#8217;s not a political record, but it&#160;specifically captures something elusive about what it feels like to come of age in an era that is simultaneously hopeful and post-<span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HOPE</a>, and&#160;</span>when the limitlessness of the internet has become so thoroughly internalized that any direct talk about it runs the risk of being unforgivably cheesy (<a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9125-vampire-weekend/"><span>Koenig</span></a>: &#8220;Even the word blog sounds a little grandma-y&#8221;).</p> <p dir="ltr">So the slyest-- and maybe smartest-- thing about the omnivorously referential <i>Modern Vampires&#160;</i>is that it manages to be earnest but never<i> too</i> on the nose. Chief arranger Rostam Batmanglij envelops the music in a dense-yet-airy fog, which provides the perfect foundation for Koenig's lyrics, which are at once hyper-articulate and playfully evasive. &#8220;The perfect tone is halfway between deeply serious and totally fucking around,&#8221; Koenig said, pointing specifically to the single &#8220;Diane Young&#8221;. The band thought about calling the song &#8220;Dying Young&#8221;, but quickly decided to go with a cheeky homophone instead; &#8220;Dying Young&#8221; sounded &#8220;so heavy and self-serious.&#8221; And maybe that seemingly tiny pivot is the most profoundly millennial thing about it. How do you make a record about post-ironic characters who cringe at the phrase &#8220;post-irony,&#8221; a record that sneakily defines a generation that&#8217;s always going to approach something generation-defining with an air of "this isn&#8217;t me, exactly?" The answer may exist somewhere in the space between dying young and &#8220;Diane Young&#8221;.</p> <p dir="ltr"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/Screen%20Shot%202013-07-09%20at%203.31.16%20PM.png" alt="" width="620"></p> <p dir="ltr">Both sonically and lyrically, the album&#160;is richly panoramic, but one particular thing that strikes me every time I listen is how often it references time. From the persistent second hand tick in &#8220;Don&#8217;t Lie&#8221; to the way the refrain &#8220;there&#8217;s a lifetime right in front of you&#8221; becomes, in a flicker as unceremoniously devastating as a lost afternoon lapsed on a digital clock, &#8220;there&#8217;s a headstone right in front of you.&#8221; There&#8217;s something strange, illogical, and uneasy about the way time passes on this record; you could definitely say it&#8217;s on some <a href="http://dlisted.com/2009/01/09/daaaaaaaamn-this-is-some-benjamin-buttons-shit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span>Benjamin Button shit</span></a>. Koenig&#8217;s characters age erratically (&#8220;young hips shouldn&#8217;t break on the ice&#8221;) or live, stubbornly, forever (&#8220;hold me in your everlasting arms&#8221;), but it&#8217;s a testament to Batmanglij&#8217;s vision that you feel this tug-of-war between past and future on a wordless, gut level too. We&#8217;re living, as the writer Michelle Orange observes in her very good new essay collection <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0374533326" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>This Is Running for Your Life</i></a>, &#8220;in a time that is no time and only time and all times, all the time.&#8221;&#160;<i>Modern Vampires&#160;</i>renders exactly what that sounds like and acknowledges it as a perfectly good reason for an identity crisis. Somewhere between the lines, though, it also reassures-- "oh, sweet thing"-- that this is not the end of the world: to some extent, things have always been this way. Time marches on.</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The album's centerpiece (and my favorite song of the year so far), &#8220;Hannah Hunt&#8221;, feels simultaneously hyper-modern and timeless. It&#8217;s about the allure of going off the clock and off the grid, which might seem like a distinctly 2013 concern to somebody who&#8217;s never read </span><i>Walden</i><span> or heard &#8220;Born to Run&#8221;. So maybe the only new thing about &#8220;Hannah Hunt&#8221; is its context-- that it sees human connection as a potential relief from today's&#160;</span><i>no time and only time and all times, all the time</i><span>. It&#8217;s a break-up song, and a devastating one at that, but in this four-minute world, love is both a freeze frame amidst the rush and a belief in the primacy of the present: &#8220;You and me, we got our own sense of time.&#8221;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/Screen%20Shot%202013-07-09%20at%203.33.15%20PM.png" alt="" width="620"><br></span></p> <p>Last month, two of my friends got married and, as everyone moved from an antiquarian, marble-surfaced atrium to the adjacent reception hall, one of the first songs they played was Vampire Weekend's <a href="http://youtu.be/_mDxcDjg9P4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Step"</a>. &#8220;Wedding DJs playing Vampire Weekend!&#8221; seems like a detail someone might include, with outsized anthropological significance, in an article about millennials getting married-- though, if I were to read something like it now, my response would be, &#8220;Well yeah. And... ?&#8221; Sometimes it takes a record to clarify something very obvious, and in this case it's something young people have been allowed to believe since the beginning of time: Our present is just as good as your past.</p>

Speedy Ortiz: &quot;Tiger Tank&quot; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/carparkrecords/speedy-ortiz-tiger-tank/s-Z8geX"> on SoundCloud</a>. </span></p> <p>"I got a boy in a hardcore band/ I got a boy likes to fuck to Can/ Then there's the boy sings those sad songs I like/ I got too many boyfriends to see you tonight."</p> <p>Thus goes the chorus to last year's debut single by <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31267-speedy-ortiz/" target="_blank">Speedy Ortiz</a>, a band working in the angular, abrasive tradition of independent rock'n'roll with a gender-blurring poet of a frontwoman. The track is sarcastically titled <a href="http://speedyortiz.bandcamp.com/track/taylor-swift" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"Taylor Swift"</a>. "You hear so many songs about dudes who brag about how many different women they can pull," explains the quartet's 25-year-old singer and songwriter Sadie Dupuis. "So here's my response to that. Winky face." While the band's subject matter and lexicon have expanded to a smart array of emotional, empowering narratives, it's that core-- wry wit that's both funny and sharp-- that makes up of the essence of Speedy Ortiz.</p> <p>I'd first met Dupuis a few years ago through her old grungy Brooklyn band <a href="http://quilty.bandcamp.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quilty</a>; a Manhattan native, she studied poetry at M.I.T. and Barnard before heading to the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she's currently finishing her MFA. It's there that she joined up with drummer Mike Falcone (who studies library science in New Haven), guitarist Matt Robidoux (a guitar teacher who runs the label <a href="http://www.hiddentempletapes.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hidden Temple</a>), and Polvo-worshipping bassist Darl Ferm at the beginning of last year, quickly releasing "Taylor Swift" and the five-track <i>Sports</i> EP. </p> <p>While those records showed promise, their debut LP, <i>Major Arcana</i>, out this week via <a href="http://carparkrecords.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carpark</a>, is an exciting dive forward. It offers nods at legendary 90s alt rock wordsmiths like <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/">Liz Phair</a> and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/">Pavement</a>-- Dupuis once fronted an all-female Pavement cover band called Babement-- while igniting its own <a href="http://speedyortiz.bandcamp.com/track/suck-buddies" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">anti-cool</a> persona, and gesturing towards something singular. Her lyrics are clever and literary, offering so much to latch onto and explore that they all but demand a strong cult following.</p> <p>
Speedy Ortiz: &quot;No Below&quot; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/carparkrecords/speedy-ortiz-no-below/s-yPP1h"> on SoundCloud</a>. </p> <p>Speedy wears its basement roots proudly-- while the dudes and I are waiting for Sadie to finish a massive vocal take of album highlight <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15591-speedy-ortiz-no-below/" target="_blank">"No Below"</a> during a video shoot in Brooklyn's Greenpoint neighborhood, we discuss the obscure intricacies of the Brattleboro, Vermont, freak scene. Though the band hasn't played Boston much recently due to the city's crackdown on house shows, their favorite venue in their tight-knit Northampton scene is Robidoux's house, which has hosted shows for eight years. It's also near <a href="http://www.feedingtuberecords.com/Feedingtuberecords.com/WELCOME_TO_FEEDING_TUBE_RECORDS.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Feeding Tube Records</a>, started in part by local <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3874-thurston-moore/">Thurston Moore</a>, with whom they toured in 2012.</p> <p>I spoke with all four members of the group about the Massachusetts rock scene, reclaiming rap stereotypes, gender neutral voices, LiveJournal, and more.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>"Our biggest connection to 90s bands is that they <br />had tons of personality. Over the last decade, there have <br />been so many boring, dime-a-dozen bands. We don't relate to them."</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Pitchfork: There seem to be some pretty undeniable reference points to music from the 90s on your album: Liz Phair, Stephen Malkmus, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1920-helium/">Helium</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3358-polvo/">Polvo</a>.</b></p> <p>Sadie Dupuis: I grew up listening to those things over and over.</p> <p>Matt Robidoux: I don't listen to those bands now though.</p> <p>Darl Ferm: I haven't listened to Pavement in a while.</p> <p>SD: I still do-- and we all listened to Pavement on the way here today.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: We're all around the same age, and we were little kids when this stuff was first coming out. How did you get into these bands from the 90s?</b></p> <p>SD: I would steal my dad's CDs. He would go to the Virgin Megastore-- R.I.P.-- and buy a bunch of stuff he would never open, because the clerk told him it was cool. I definitely stole Sebadoh when I was maybe 12, and Liz Phair. <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4427-unwound/">Unwound</a> is a big thing I still listen to.</p> <p>DF: My guitar teacher showed me them around that same age. He was like: "Listen to Minutemen, Dinosaur Jr., all the stuff from that book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Band_Could_Be_Your_Life" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Our Band Could Be Your Life</i></a>."</p> <p>Mike Falcone: Those were 80s bands, though, and I consider them a bigger influence than a lot of the 90s stuff. We're influenced by a lot of guitar rock from 1970 to present, not one specific era.</p> <p>MR: I remember seeing a Pavement sticker at the burrito place in town and thinking it was cool, and then downloading them on Napster.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: A lot of bands from the past couple of years who are reminiscent of the 90s seemed to miss something in terms of having their own voice.</b></p> <p>SD: Are you talking about <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck/">Yuck</a>? I heard a Yuck song on the radio the other day and was like, "Is this a Dinosaur Jr. song I can't remember?" I remember being bummed when they were doing really hot. I thought they were doing a similar thing to [our friends] <a href="http://ovlov.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ovlov</a>, but less well.</p> <p>MF: I like Yuck.</p> <p>DF: I hate Yuck.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Something that appeals to me about Speedy Ortiz is the band has real attitude, personality, character. Is it something you consider intentionally?</b></p> <p>MF: You just nailed it-- that's our biggest 90s connection. Those bands had tons of personality. Over the last decade, there have been so many boring, dime-a-dozen bands. We don't relate to those types of bands. Should I name names?</p> <p>SD: Yeah.</p> <p>MF: I've seen <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/">the Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a> and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28248-surfer-blood/">Surfer Blood</a>, and I felt like I'd seen them eight billion times before. I knew the songs; they were good songs. But they just stood there. I don't think we're boring on stage. When we played Detroit, Matt fucking left the building and stood in the middle of the street and played a guitar solo while we were playing a song.</p> <p>SD: We played WBAR-BQ, and Matt walked over to a gate during the set and put his guitar through the fence. There was a queer theory blog that did a reading of what that meant.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/N4-X-KlJiUk?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Sadie, you wrote the song "Ka-Prow" while teaching a songwriting class at a summer camp. Did that experience influence your own work?</b></p> <p>SD: I was at that arts camp for 10 years, it's called <a href="http://www.bucksrockcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Buck's Rock</a>, in Connecticut. I went to it as a kid and it's where I learned to play guitar. I ended up working there, teaching teens ages 13-17. They would write a song in an hour, and then we all share. Now, I don't labor over things as much as some songwriters I know, because I've gotten used to writing something in 40 minutes, which has led to a songwriting style that is more automatic.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: You have one more year working on your MFA in poetry at Amherst. How does your work as a poet differ from the writing you do as a musician?</b></p> <p>SD: Poetry is a lot more serious. I have more legroom with this band, and it's mostly writing to fit the music. Poetry's got to stand on its own. I do readings, but I don't like to, and have terrible stage fright with it. Anytime I have to be in front of anybody without a guitar, it's horrible for me. Sometimes, it's easier to communicate certain emotions without words.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Are there any specific poets who have influenced your lyrics?</b></p> <p>SD: I've been reading <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/dorothea-lasky" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dorothea Lasky</a>, who's very good at being funny and also sad and really strange in one poem. Her lines take terms I would like to emulate in my songwriting. Other than that, I wouldn't say there's anyone in particular whose universe inspires mine.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>"I don't think people at a punk show in Iowa, where there's shit and blood on the floor, want to walk away with a poetry chapbook."</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Pitchfork: Did you want to study poetry because of your interest in music?</b></p> <p>SD: It was separate. I went to M.I.T. for two years, for math, then switched to writing. Then I dropped out and moved to Texas and worked at a record store called Waterloo, and as a waitress, for a few months. Then I got this internship at <i>SPIN</i>, so I came back to New York. [<i>SPIN</i> music editor] <a href="http://www.spin.com/writers/charles-aaron/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charles Aaron</a> let me transcribe everything he's ever written in print. I got into music journalism because I play music-- I didn't expect to have much of a go at that, and I'm not really involved now-- but close listening and having to articulate fine details has helped me know small things I like and small things that would bother me.</p> <p>I wound up studying poetry at Barnard. After that, I applied to some grad schools thinking I wanted to be a journalist, but I wasn't finding steady work. So when I got into [Amherst] to teach writing and study poetry, it seemed like I should take a few years and figure things out. I know I’ll continute to write, but I’m not working hard to publish a book right now because this band takes up so much time. Sadly, my free education is on the back burner.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: I read that you bring poetry chapbooks to distribute at shows.</b></p> <p>SD: Yeah, we made some for our tour with Thurston Moore, but aside from that, we haven't really had them. I don't think there's a ton of crossover with people who like chapbooks and also want to come to a show by a band that sounds like us. Well, maybe in Western Mass, but not in a basement punk show in Iowa where there's shit and blood on the floor. I don't think they want to walk away with a chapbook.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-V3hM-YDsOk?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: To me, songs like "Pioneer Spine" and "Tiger Tank" sound like they're about being strong in the face of something empty, or self-reliance against certain situations. Are those feelings you go for when you're writing? </b></p> <p>SD: I like those interpretations, but both of those songs come more from places of insecurity, and trying to document that as a way to coach myself out of it. I don't know if I'd think about those songs as places of strength as much as just trying to get there. They're kind of downers. I'm not the most fun guy.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: There's a great gender-blurring line on "Fun" where you sing: "Now I'm getting my dick sucked on the regular." </b></p> <p>SD: I try to write from a gender-neutral voice. In rap music, it's a symbol of success-- you got all these girls on your dick. So that was my flippant way of saying that I'm having some success in my life. There was someone who I maybe wanted to show-up a little bit, too-- to be like, "Life's working out for me. I'm getting my dick sucked." At one point, I got really embarassed and thought about changing it.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Do you listen to much rap?</b></p> <p>MF: We all listen to [NYC hip-hop station] Hot 97 as soon as we can get it.</p> <p>SD: I don’t think Hot 97 is very good.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: "No Below" is a pretty literal song. But I think the central idea-- of being a cold, depressed loner as a kid, and then realizing when you're older that most of your friends were probably like that, too-- is very relatable. </b></p> <p>SD: That is one I wrote when I wasn't really bummed out. It was more to cheer someone else up. I didn’t think we would play that song at all. I thought it was gonna be a demo. I didn’t want to seem too sappy.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: The line on "Tiger Tank"-- "I've limped before, I could limp again"-- is especially resonant.</b></p> <p>SD: I have a hard time writing when I'm happy. The point is for me to have something to occupy my thoughts. That song was about coping with depression and having people not believe you because you can put on a good face and pretend it's not an issue. It's frustrating to not be believed.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qhFQRMVLblc?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: I read about the Speedy Curse on <a href="http://speedyortiz.livejournal.com/8033.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">your LiveJournal</a>, how a lot of spaces shut down after you played them. Why do you have a band LiveJournal?</b></p> <p>MF: Because it's funny. We thought it was absurd to have it as our offical website. It's our TMI blog, for the die-hards.</p> <p>SD: You see all these punk bands whose only website is a Blogspot-- like that's the punk thing to do now. And it's so ridiculious. Blogspot is a corporate, Google-owned thing. Then you see bands with slick Tumblrs and they're like: "Help us get to 600 likes!" We try to not take ourselves seriously with that kind of stuff, I think it's pretty lame.</p> <p>

Everyone supports each other.</p> <p>DF: There are a lot of bands in Boston that sound heavily influenced by other bands making music in Boston right now, too.</p> <p>SD: We've played with Pile a bajillion times-- I don't think there's a way you can play with a band that many times and not have something rub off.</p> <p>DF: Another common thread is not taking yourself <i>too</i> seriously. Krill has the most incomprehensible web presence and they released their album in a ball of mozzarella. Fat History Month just stop playing before their songs are finished. </p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/speedybrack.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Do you find Western Massachusetts creatively inspiring in a different way than New York? <b>Do you think the area's history seeps into peoples' heads?</b></b></p> <p>MF: Check out <a href="http://speedyortiz.livejournal.com/7820.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Mass mixtape</a> [on our LiveJournal].</p> <p>SD: There's a different sense of community in smaller scenes; it can be more insular. Maybe because Boston has a New York inferiority complex, there's a real tight-knit closeness to the rock scene. I don't think we're intentionally trying to sound like bands from Massachusetts, but maybe there's something in the water. And college kids love college rock.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Do you feel like there's a connecting attitude among these bands?</b></p> <p>DF: They’re really hard working. I’ve been in bands that don’t really do anything, which is a totally different vibe from playing lots of shows constantly.</p> <p>SD: The fact that we came up in basement scenes reinforces a certain approach. And it's cool that everyone's into what they're calling "1990s-inspired rock"-- I would quiver at the term-- but a lot of these people were playing in other guitar bands when artists and critics didn't necessarily care about rock music. In 2009, nobody was going to point to a 90s-sounding band and expect anyone to care. It was more about synth-punk, like Dan Deacon. So maybe the shared ideology is about not expecting anyone to care about rock music anymore. And it doesn't matter if they do care, because we're playing music that we like.</p>

</p> <p class="p1"><i>Listen along with <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/pitchforkmedia/playlist/3aAbeYzUdV39Tg6BbFl1aj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this 10-track Spotify playlist</a> highlighting the Raincoats' finest moments.</i> </p> <hr /> <p class="p1">In 2009, the English band <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3517-the-raincoats/">the Raincoats</a>, like a lot of bands that formed in the 1970s and 80s, started playing shows again. I saw them at the Knitting Factory, which had just moved from Manhattan to Brooklyn after 22 years: A newly relocated space hosting a newly revived band.</p> <p class="p1">Situations like this tend to be zero-sum games: The excitement of seeing a band you’ve never had the opportunity to see before gets leveraged not only against your own high expectations, but against the idea that you were never <i>supposed</i> to see them-- that you had come to love them as something distant and finite, part of a past that felt more precious because you assumed it would never happen again. <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span>I had been listening to their music on record for so long that it had become impossible for me to imagine it being played by human beings with instruments in their hands. </span></span><span>I kept telling myself the women onstage were not the Raincoats, but actors hired to play them.</span>  </p> <p class="p1">Then I remembered the liner notes <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6161-kurt-cobain/">Kurt Cobain</a> had written for a reissue of the band’s self-titled debut: “Rather than listening to them, I feel like I’m listening in on them. We’re together in the same old house and I have to be completely still or they will hear my spying from above, and if I get caught, everything will be ruined.”</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p1">For the purposes of historical record, the Raincoats are a punk band, but little of what makes punk stereotypically “punk” applies to them.</p> </blockquote> <p class="p1">Something about the spirit of the their sound-- which between 1979 and 1984 shifted from folksy, amateurish punk to something like art-school world music-- seemed inherently private. When they formed in 1977, bassist Gina Birch was living in an East London squat so gnarly that mushrooms grew out of the walls, and in some respects, this is how I’ve always thought of them: Wild growth in a domestic space, strange and untamed but off to the side, between the cracks, in places where nobody bothers to look.</p> <p class="p1">I call Birch the Raincoats’ bassist, but it might be premature. At the time the band formed, she was an art student, and until about two weeks before their first show, did not actually own a bass guitar. The inspiration to start playing music came, in true punk fashion, from watching other people who didn’t know how to play music get in front of an audience and play it anyway-- in this case, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/">the Slits</a>, a mischievous punk-reggae trio whose frontwoman, Ari Up, was only 15 years old.</p> <p class="p1">Birch had seen the show with a Portuguese doctorate student named Ana da Silva, who became the Raincoats’ guitarist. (In several interviews, Birch-- who has described herself as “whiter than white”-- recalls, almost wonderstruck, da Silva’s tan.) Eventually, the Slits’ drummer, a Spanish journeywoman who <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/">Clash</a> bassist Paul Siminon nicknamed “Palmolive” because he found it difficult to say “Paloma,” joined, then turned around and recruited a violinist named Vicky Aspinall through an ad pasted on the wall of a bookstore. “Female musician wanted,” the ad read. “No style but strength.”</p> <p class="p1">Punk, especially in its infancy-- and especially in England-- was built on loud, confrontational statements. A sampling of early English punk lyrics include the lines, “I wanna riot,” “I wanna be anarchy,” “Oh bondage, up yours,” and “AHHHHHHHHHHHH.” Disciples of punk wore mohawks, safety pins, brightly colored hair, and whatever else they hoped might get the attention of a society they simultaneously hated and yet desperately wanted to be acknowledged by.</p> <p class="p1">For the purposes of historical record, the Raincoats are a punk band, or an early post-punk band, but little of what makes punk stereotypically “punk” applies to them. They had a violinist. They wore dresses. They were all women but, despite being part of a male-centric scene, never overcompensated by making a circus of either sex or personal politics. Several writers before me have pointed out that their 1979 debut, <i>The Raincoats</i>, sounds less like punk and more like folk song and nursery rhyme played at high volumes.</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/rainco.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p1">In a lot of ways, they prefigured an aesthetic that didn’t really take hold until the 80s and 90s with labels like <a href="http://krecs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">K</a> and <a href="http://www.killrockstars.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kill Rock Stars</a>: The librarian-punk; radical, educated, but domestic in nature and more interested in building a new world through book clubs and farm shares than tearing down what’s already there. Without them, there are no riot grrrl knitting circles; without them, there is no punk-minded re-evaluation of the cardigan sweater.</p> <p class="p1">While Birch says she learned to play her instrument onstage, the music of the Raincoats is haphazard and intimate, as though the band existed less to perform for their audience and more to be witnessed by them. If the band had to be summed up in a single moment, it’s the joyful opening seconds of <a href="http://youtu.be/r2EDHYk50S0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“No Side to Fall In”</a>, in which a gang chorus shouts the words, “I am the music inside”-- a moment that applies the catalyzing energy of punk to private discovery instead of public protest.</p> <p class="p1">Between 1979 and 1983, they recorded three studio albums: <i>The Raincoats</i>, <i>Odyshape</i>, and <i>Moving</i>. They also released a live album called <i>The Kitchen Tapes</i>, which I had always assumed was called <i>The Kitchen Tapes</i> because the kitchen-- contrary to, say, the garage-- is a space where I imagine the music of the Raincoats taking place: between the oven and the counter, maybe, like an admirably bold mouse. In 1993, Geffen reissued their early albums in part at the insistence of Kurt Cobain, who adored them, which prompted another studio album, <i>Looking in the Shadows</i>. </p> <p class="p1"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/MMB1WMi-jEI?rel=0" width="624" height="468" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1"><i>The Raincoats</i> is still their best. Only about half of its songs keep a steady beat from start to finish. The rest speed up, slow down, start, stop, and sputter like haywire wind-up toys. Most of the time it doesn’t seem like the band is controlling the music as much as chasing it down and tackling it. It’s the work of children or, if not children, adults who discovered a space of judgment-free exuberance through music-- a space that doesn't make room for command and expertise. “We rehearsed for hours,” Ana da Silva told Simon Reynolds in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rip-It-Start-Again-1978-1984/dp/0143036726" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Rip It Up and Start Again</i></a>, “but we always fell apart.”</p> <p class="p1">But falling apart, or at least the <i>threat</i> of falling apart, is what makes <i>The Raincoats</i> exciting. With every tempo change and precariously structured arrangement, the thread holding the music together frays. As a listener, I feel an almost physiological need to hear Palmolive play one drumbeat at some regular interval after the preceding drumbeat, but this is not what Palmolive-- or anyone else in the band-- does. Instead, they gallop ahead with no clear indication that they will make it to the next chorus, let alone the end of the song. I root for them for the same reasons I reflexively root for underdogs: If you think they might not make it, it’s even more gratifying when they do.</p> <p class="p1">There are times that the album feels less like premeditated music and more like séance captured on tape. And yet few albums are so determinedly planted in the real world. Palmolive’s drums sound like cardboard boxes; Vicky Aspinall’s violin resembles the siren on a battery-powered ambulance. “Fairytale in the Supermarket” is about the supermarket; <a href="http://youtu.be/61Ocno-uI3s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“No Looking”</a> takes place between two lovers over morning coffee. “Went to fight dragons in the land of concrete,” goes a line on <a href="http://youtu.be/slAf8Mqt63I" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“Adventures Close to Home”</a>-- a line that finds mythical import in someone’s daily commute. </p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/odysha.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p1"><i>Odyshape</i> is so skeletal and mysterious by comparison that it almost sounds like the work of a different band. Palmolive had quit, and most of the songs were written without a drummer in mind. Birch, da Silva, and Aspinall had professedly started listening to Ornette Coleman and the outer reaches of jazz. The songs have a haunted, spectral quality-- as loose and collective feeling as the music on <i>The Raincoats</i> but to different and more overtly spiritual ends. Scratching noises, howls, and tempests of violin intrude suddenly, then fade away.</p> <p class="p1">Despite the album’s idiosyncrasies, it’s probably more in-step with what other bands were doing at the time than <i>The Raincoats</i> was. By 1981, punk at its crudest and most formulaic was being left behind by its creators for sounds that were, in short, weirder and less white. Like <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/23514-public-image-ltd/">Public Image Ltd.</a>’s <i>The Flowers of Romance</i>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4216-this-heat/">This Heat</a>’s <i>Deceit</i>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4016-swell-maps/">Swell Maps</a>’ mysterious collages, or even some of art-rock singer <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4629-robert-wyatt/">Robert Wyatt</a>’s music for the Rough Trade label, <i>Odyshape</i> is part of a moment where punk energy shifted to what basically sounds like avant-garde world music, cribbing from reggae, North African and Arabian scales, and free improv. It thrashes and wails, but at no point does it rock.  </p> <p class="p1">Whether <i>Odyshape</i> is better than <i>The Raincoats </i>or not is something I can’t comment on without bias: There are almost <i>no</i> albums that are better than <i>The Raincoats</i> in my mind. But as a complement to <i>The Raincoats</i>, <i>Odyshape</i> is evidence of how quietly fearless the band was, how capable they were not of bucking convention but of avoiding convention without having to buck, shuck, blast, or perform any other kind of violent verb to it in order to get their point across. Modesty is an irrelevant virtue in punk, but that only makes the Raincoats seem more powerful.  </p> <p class="p1"><i>Moving </i>has its highlights, particularly <a href="http://youtu.be/6JGceyIIgig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“The Body”</a>, <a href="http://youtu.be/D3lJNkU17Xo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“Animal Rhapsody”</a>, and the seriously catchy but a little one-dimensional <a href="http://youtu.be/CEvl-VcWr2s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“No One’s Little Girl”</a>, the title of which should let you know that they eventually reached a point where they dragged the implicit politics of their music above-ground. <i>Looking in the Shadows </i>is OK, but I often forget it exists; and the<i> Kitchen Tapes</i> is good, too, though unnecessary, especially for a band whose studio recordings have the charms of first takes. But none have the sense of purpose of <i>The Raincoats</i> or <i>Odyshape, </i>which can sound not just like a band playing music but of a band laying out an entirely new blueprint for how music can be made.</p> <p class="p1">Before leaving the Knitting Factory that night in 2009, I bought a button. It is light brown and says <a href="http://www.theraincoats.net/images/theraincoats-button-rnd2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">THE RAINCOATS</a> on it in shaky lettering. When I got home, I fastened it to my backpack. I don’t carry the backpack often, and even when I do, the button is still too small for anyone to read. It makes more sense to me that way.</p>

Sampha: &quot;Indecision&quot; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/samphamusic/indecision"> on SoundCloud</a>. </p> <p class="p1">Sampha Sisay has a quiet way about him, the sort of soft, hesitant speaking voice that calls for a patient ear. It’s what makes the raw emotion that spills out of him when he sings all the more startling. When he was a little kid, the youngest of five brothers growing up in South London, his dad would buy a CD every week on his way home from work. One week it would be Pavarotti, the next the Spice Girls. One of those CDs was <a href="http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/worotan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Worotan </i></a>by the Malian singer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oumou_Sangar%C3%A9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oumou Sangaré</a>: "I listen to it now and it’s a big influence on the way I view melodies and scales," he says over an early lunch in Brixton Market. "That immediacy of melody, those rhythms, and the production awakened something in me."</p> <p class="p1">"Awakened" is a word that speaks volumes of Sampha. And after years of collaborative projects and behind-the-scenes work, the 24-year-old is now, as he puts it, "more comfortable with the idea of showing the world what I do by myself." While he provided vocal hooks to the frenetic beats of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28873-sbtrkt/">SBTRKT</a>’s 2010 12"s, it was his 2011 duet with <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/">Jessie Ware</a>, "Valentine", that first showcased the full potential of his voice: warm, worn, and seemingly born from a place of pain. (The track's silk-spun production was his, too.)</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2M6VItZtAh4?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p>He went on to have a key supporting role on SBTRKT’s debut album that same year-- writing lyrics for and singing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x6DmYxnBaI&amp;noredirect=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"Hold On"</a>, amongst others-- and was the masked performer’s keys-and-percussion sidekick for an intensive period of touring that swallowed up most of 2012. The more playful side of Sampha’s sonic palette got an airing earlier this year with his <a href="http://boomkat.com/vinyl/638315-short-stories-koreless-sampha-on-the-way-let-it-go" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Short Stories</a> side project with <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28921-koreless/">Koreless</a>. Then, out of the blue last week, he popped up on <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/">Drake</a>'s new single "The Motion", for which Sampha contributed both the suspended-emotion production and vocals.</p> <p>
Drake: &quot;The Motion&quot; [ft. Sampha] <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/octobersveryown/drake-the-motion"> on SoundCloud</a>. </p> <p class="p1">That Drake saw him as a producer clearly means a lot to Sampha as he talks disbelievingly about traveling to the rapper's studio in Toronto. Yet, like Drake, it's the trials and tribulations of family life-- Sampha’s father passed away when he was nine and he is very close to his mother and brothers-- that have shaped his approach to music above all else. <i>Dual</i>, his forthcoming solo EP due out July 29 via <a href="http://theyoungturks.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Young Turks</a>, teems with such moments. At one point, he addresses his absent father; at another, the stomp of his mother’s feet is audible beneath his piano playing. It’s a deeply personal record that Sampha says was partly inspired by "the duality of telling someone 'I’m fine' but feeling different internally-- that performance aspect of your life, creating this person for other people."</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p1">"You have to be quite brave to write about <br />something that you honestly feel and think."</p> </blockquote> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: There’s a lot of love and a lot of pain on <i>Dual</i>. Can you recall the moment you wrote "Indecision"?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>S: I wrote it around the time of Amy Winehouse’s death. It's slightly about myself but more about someone who has problems; fundamental issues. That thing of trying to have the courage to work through your problems. "Let it all work out" is kind of a mantra in itself but it's also saying you <i>can’t</i> always let it all work out-- you have to have the courage to do something about it: the courage to have a relationship with someone, to tell people how you feel without those feelings being reciprocated, to analyze yourself-- all those things. </p> <p class="p1"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KWEbYsXeDvE?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: What was the impetus behind "Without"?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>S: I wrote it a few nights after I met someone I liked. I was just thinking about my own natural way of one-night stands: always wanting to be more attached to something. I’m not very good at detaching myself. Maybe I was being a little bit over the top, [<i>sings</i>] "without you, life is going to be this and that." [<i>laughs</i>]</p> <p class="p1">

I started at my brother’s because he had [music program] Cubase, and then I went into Reason. I had friends around the area who were MCs, and I’d try and produce for them, but they wouldn’t take the beats. It was a struggle: "<i>Trust me, you should spit on this." </i>I really got into the <a href="http://lordofthemics.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lord of the Mics</a> DVDs, just watching crews like <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3661-ruff-sqwad/" target="_blank">Ruff Sqwad</a> and Roll Deep. I have a cousin called <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Flirta+D" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flirta D</a> who was big in the grime world, which made me really cool at school. "Flirta D’s your cousin?" "Yeah, buddy." "He must be a millionaire!" </p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: What drives your production choices and the sounds you go for?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>S: Sometimes I listen to music and I wonder how did they got certain sounds. I’ve been listening to a lot of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7531-original-pirate-material/">the Streets' <i>Original Pirate Material </i></a>recently. The fact he did it all from an estate, and most of it from his bedroom, and was able to capture the feeling of listening to something on pirate radio-- with that piano sound and the nostalgic feel it brings-- is incredible.<span class="s1"> T</span>here’s a purity to those beats and an awareness he has in his storytelling and where he’s from. I’m sort of jealous of his ability to express what he actually goes through.</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/samphaaa.jpg" alt="" /><br /><i><small>Photo by Tyrone Lebon</small></i></p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: What’s the story with the Drake collaboration?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>S: I met him in Toronto when he did a surprise guest appearance at a SBTRKT show. He invited me to Canada to come and do some writing with him. It’s weird because he sees me as a producer as well as a singer. We worked together for a couple of days. He’s a really nice guy, really open. I think he’s an incredible songwriter, somewhat similar to the Streets in his ability to articulate fine details.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Were you singing or producing with Drake?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>S: I was producing and I did a bit of singing, too. There was a backwards piano loop sample, which [Drake’s producer] 40 gave to me, and I worked a production around it. I started playing and singing, and Drake liked the bounce of it and started writing lyrics on his BlackBerry. It was a really surreal thing, watching him go into the booth and then start to record his vocals. I was like, "This sounds like a record."</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: It makes me think about what you said about courage: being able to name a feeling and being OK with that being out there.</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>S: That’s exactly what Drake did-- he was talking about something extremely personal, and I was like, "wow." When it’s so real and raw, it’s not even, like, pleasurable. For me, when I’m writing something really personal, I don’t feel good about it. It’s weird that people can connect to it and like something that came from a really crap place. You have to be quite brave to write about something that you honestly feel and think. Sometimes you think certain details are things that only you would notice, so it’s a great thing to feel like you’re not by yourself and people understand where you’re coming from. When you feel totally alone in your thoughts and feelings, there’s someone out there who is going through what you went through, even if it’s the strangest, weirdest thing you could think of. </p>

If J.J. Abrams is looking for new walk-on music for Darth Vader in his <i>Star Wars</i> reboot, John Williams can cash his severance check right now: Meredith’s opus rallies a tangle of brass fanfares before introducing a sound barrier-bending wub that feels like it could vaporize a human body at the right volume. As far as making an entrance goes, the imperial track is a monogrammed red carpet, a dozen footmen, and a billowing velvet cape-- a hell of an introduction to the London-based, Edinburgh-raised musician.</p> <p>“Nautilus” actually heralds the start of Meredith’s <i>second</i> act-- the 35-year-old is already a renowned, groundbreaking force in more rarefied fields. After several years as composer in residence with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the rising classical star had an original piece performed at the BBC’s prestigious Last Night of the Proms at London’s Royal Albert Hall last August as well. During the concert, Meredith's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo97ztKppIw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“HandsFree”</a> saw 160 members of the National Youth Orchestra lay down their instruments to click, clap, and cluck in unison, using Reichian body percussion to conjure a sound akin to waves crashing through a jungle-- a great antidote to the stuffy surroundings. “The Proms is such a weird, nationalistic thing-- I had actual proper, physical hate mail,” Meredith explains, half-impressed by the sender’s outrage. She's sitting in the tiny room where she composes at home in Camberwell, South London, coming through via Skype.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Xo97ztKppIw?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p>An hour in Meredith’s company proves her to be tremendously cool-headed and game for anything: She’s scored music for MRI scanners, concertos for beatboxers, and a piece for five symphony orchestras in different corners of the country, connected by satellite. “I have a gung-ho attitude, which has been a curse and a blessing,” she says. “Like with ‘Nautilus’, I came up with a bit of it, and thought, ‘Well, that’s a bit ridiculous, but let’s just roll with it!’” The song (which <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5720-foals/" target="_blank">Foals</a> have been using as their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXrNcWB2vzc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">live entrance music</a>) headed up her debut electronic EP, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17400-black-prince-fury/" target="_blank"><i>Black Prince Fury</i></a>, released on <a href="http://www.moshimoshimusic.com/news/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Moshi Moshi</a> last October, a spiky, squirming set that married sci-fi soundtracking with Queen-worthy bombast.</p> <p>
Anna Meredith: &quot;Orlok&quot; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/moshimoshimusic/anna-meredith-orlok"> on SoundCloud</a>. </p> <p>On August 19, she’ll follow it with <i>Jet Black Raider</i>, an EP pitched somewhere between the respective maximalist strains of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4850-planningtorock/" target="_blank">Planningtorock</a> and <a href="pitchfork.com/artists/30056-fatima-al-qadiri/" target="_blank">Fatima Al Qadiri</a>-- check out lead single "Orlok", above. Although several of her song titles sound like levels in a gothic MMPORG (some are actually named after her mum’s childhood imaginary horses), Meredith doesn’t start from a point of visual inspiration, but conviction. “I might have some adjectives-- oily, gritty, ‘like seals at a disco’ was one idea-- but essentially you need to write strong. There’s so much over-saturation of music that making something memorable or characterful is more important than originality.”</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Vajhs2wBeCU?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: How did the process of making <i>Jet Black Raider</i> differ from <i>Black Prince Fury</i>? What’s the ratio of physical to synthesized instruments?</b></p> <p>Anna Meredith: The actual writing process is very similar: I start on paper, a graphic sketch to set out contours and pacing. <i>Black Prince Fury</i> had no real sounds at all, though some of them are trying to be real, which some people got very upset about. This time, the instruments are still mostly fake, but there’s clarinets, singing, glocks, drums, lots of cello. That made it a lot more time-consuming, and a lot less me-in-my-room-alone. It’s taken a ridiculously long time to do this, but I wanted to make sure I got it right.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Who got annoyed about <i>Black Prince Fury</i> being synthesized? Are electronic purists as protective as classical ones?</b></p> <p>AM: I think <a href="pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/" target="_blank">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> was sent it, and he was really nice about the material, but had problems with the kinds of synthesized sounds I was using. I had thought everyone in the electronic world would be so laid back, but there’s as many cliques and prejudices as any other world. Other friends have said, "I don’t understand why you’ve used this trumpet-style sound rather than a real one when you know you can write for trumpet." But it’s most important to get the energy right. With the classical stuff, I’ve always been better at the big brushstrokes and broad textures than spending ages honing a chord, or tweaking a sample. I’ve never been really interested in music, classical or otherwise, where the craft is more important than the result. I realized quickly that I’d never be a technical electronic musician.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: When you compose in the classical realm, there’s hundreds of years of music in that vein. Is it harder to be original in that context than in electronic music, a much younger idiom? Is originality something you’re concerned with?</b> </p> <p>AM: I used to think it was very important. But now I’m less interested in uniqueness than in goodness. I see so many concerts where the program notes are more interesting than the music. I remember talking to one composer who went through the most complicated mathematical algorithm to generate some material from scratch. It took weeks and weeks, and he came up with a C major chord. For me, honesty is more interesting than originality.</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/Anna%20Meredith%2002%20HI.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: How did you develop your skills for electronic music?</b></p> <p>AM: The very first thing I did was a piece called “Axeman”, which is for a bassoon that you wire up like an electric guitar, through pedals. I wanted it to sound like a Slash solo. That was the first time I thought about transforming sound through distortion. I did a few courses introducing technology, and I did find it quite daunting-- for years, I liked the idea but felt I could never do it, I felt like a fraud. It’s only in the last four or five years that I’ve thought: "just do it." For me, it’s all about confidence. If I’m feeling confident, then I write confident, happy, or assured music. I can hear some early electronic sketches I did where I’m clearly not confident and everything’s a bit mid-range, nothing really pushes through.</p> <p>When I look through old sketches, I can tell where I’ve thought, “What if I wrote something like <a href="pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/" target="_blank">James Blake</a>, or <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/" target="_blank">Outkast</a>?” It’s never as good. I try to listen to stuff that makes me happy for other reasons, rather than being musically inspiring. I feel happier knowing a starting point came from me. And I like stuff that gives you a physical reaction. I went to a performance where the composer put speakers under every chair in the audience. Performances are so defined by their venues-- it’d be nice for the music to dictate more of the reaction. Quite often, when I describe to people what I want, I’ll say “overwhelming”-- I want it to feel like it’s physically taking you over.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/M5gEH3W7V7Q?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: In another interview, you said you’d love to play London nightclub Plastic People one day. How would you make that work?</b></p> <p>AM: I’ve never really played a club, but I think it could suit the music quite well-- at least, I’d love to hear it on a really massive system. I want to become less and less about the laptop. That’s what’s lovely about an orchestra-- the physicality, the way every gesture relates to something you’re hearing. There’s something strange about a laptop, how you can make the tiniest gesture and make the biggest sound. I don’t feel I’ve resolved working a sense of performance into a piece yet.</p> <p>Also, if the power went out in a venue, is there still something to what you’re doing? “Bubblegum” is mostly played on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geqNaAfUo-o" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">boomwhackers</a>, to a beat. Last time we did it live, the computer crashed halfway through. We were shitting ourselves, but the music carried on. It’s the balance between wanting the power of electronics and having something real happening-- if you want people to engage in what you’re doing, I think that’s important. I want to have fun with people, but that’s hard to do with a laptop.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Have you ever seen <a href="pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/" target="_blank">Grimes</a> live?</b></p> <p>AM: No! </p> <p><b>Pitchfork: She’s always somehow tethered to her table of equipment. There’s this <a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/f6e122b1b8d733db455445d1d5bc92c6/tumblr_mlfr92e1j71qbzr8yo1_400.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">amazing photo of her</a> playing a festival where she’s moved around the front of the stage, but her hand’s reaching up behind her, triggering something else.</b> </p> <p>AM: She’s an amazing role model. She’s strong, she loves it. It’d be brilliant to see what she does from behind the table. Maybe she’s not the strongest singer, but it was partly how she sings that made me think, "Fuck it, I’ll do it too." It took an unbelievable amount of stress to make myself sing on <i>Jet Black Raider</i>, I was absolutely shitting myself, so I don’t know whether that means I’ll never do it again or not!</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/Jet%20Black%20Raider%20Packshot.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Are these EPs building up to an album?</b></p> <p>AM: I want to do an album next, hopefully next year. I’ve already got a few tracks. I like the idea of it feeling like going for a journey through the whole thing, that’d be fun to plot out.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Do you have a big dream project?</b></p> <p>AM: I’m up for a massive, bombastic tour with hydraulics, robots, lasers, 15 costume changes, projecting on a power station, big impact, big visuals. I’d love to realize the theatricality of the whole thing. To be overwhelming, to surprise you, maybe to play in hidden spaces.</p>

</p> <p>It seems clear that 2013 has been an exceptional year for new music. The months of May and June in particular saw an astounding run of great records, some of which arrived on a huge crest of hype (<a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/">Daft Punk</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/">Kanye West</a>), some of which bubbled up from the underground (<a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18060-deafheaven-sunbather/">Deafheaven</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18076-dirty-beaches-drifters-love-is-the-devil/">Dirty Beaches</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18134-after-dark-2/"><i>After Dark 2</i></a>). But there are always excellent records that you miss, releases that for one reason or another don't get around as much. Here are some of our favorites in that vein. None of these releases received a <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/best/albums/" target="_blank">Best New Music</a> designation and not all were rated above an <a href="http://pitchfork.com/best/high-scoring-albums/" target="_blank">8.0</a>, but they're all worth revisiting. Read, listen, and click through for the full reviews. We'll be back with album reviews on Monday.</p> <hr /> <p><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/nako.jpg" alt="" width="250" />Aye Nako</b><br /><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18205-aye-nako-unleash-yourself/" target="_blank"><b>Unleash Yourself</b></a><br /><b>[self-released]</b></p> <p>
Aye Nako: &quot;Cut It Off&quot; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/ayenako/cut_it_off"> on SoundCloud</a>. </p> <p class="p1">Pop punk has generally been considered the province of teenagers (or at least adults in a state of arrested development). But lately the genre seems to be having its twentysomething moment, as a generation of bands who grew up on Drive-Thru Records comps, studded belts, and VFW-hall all-ages shows bring their power chords to (ever so slightly) more mature concerns. In the same spirit of the prolific Don Giovanni roster or <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30624-swearin/" target="_blank">Swearin'</a>s shambolic 2012 self-titled LP comes <i>Unleash Yourself</i>, the charmingly scrappy debut from Brooklyn four-piece <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31146-aye-nako/" target="_blank">Aye Nako</a>. On tunes like "<a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15045-aye-nako-molasses/" target="_blank">Molasses</a>" and "Cut It Off", the band specializes in the kind of rumbling, ramshackle guitar pop that always sounds one step away from utter chaos-- which is a perfect vibe for songs about that youthful art of trying (and more often failing) to get your shit together. "Watch me hit snooze again and again," singer/guitarist Mars Ganito sings on the overcast "In Sickness, Pt. 1", his voice warbling in all the right places. Hopeful, disillusioned, and occasionally sharply funny ("The Bible Belt gave you a rash, too," he howls on "For the Inverted") <i>Unleash Yourself</i> turns the growing pains of its members and its chosen genre into gold. --Lindsay Zoladz</p> <hr /> <p><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/classixx.jpg" alt="" width="250" />Classixx</b><br /><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18004-classixx-hanging-gardens/" target="_blank"><b>Hanging Gardens</b></a><br /><b>[Innovative Leisure]</b></p> <p>
Classixx: &quot;Holding On&quot; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/innovativeleisure/classixx-holding-on"> on SoundCloud</a>. </p> <p>L.A. producers Tyler Blake and Michael David ride the momentum established by some <a href="https://soundcloud.com/classixx/when-your-love-is-safe-classixx-remix-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">choice remixes </a>into the low-frills <i>Hanging Gardens</i>, a straightforward dance record that's easy to love. Contributors like <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/" target="_blank">LCD Soundsystem</a>'s Nancy Whang, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28702-kisses/" target="_blank">Kisses</a>' Jesse Kivel, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28560-active-child/" target="_blank">Active Child</a>'s Pat Grossi, and Sarah Chernoff give the proceedings a warm, friendly feel, resulting in swirling jams like the Chernoff-featuring "A Stranger Love" and bouncing, squealing songs like "Holding On". The best example of the album's joyful nature is probably "I'll Get You", a shimmering cut that features <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2218-junior-senior/" target="_blank">Junior Senior</a>'s Jeppe Laursen chanting "Do you like bass? Do you, do you like bass?" As mentioned in our <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18004-classixx-hanging-gardens/" target="_blank">review</a>, it's the kind of moment that could easily come off as cloying or silly, but Classixx find a way to make it work. That's a snapshot of <i>Hanging Gardens</i> as a whole, a modest record that sneakily transcends its limitations. --Corban Goble</p> <hr /> <p><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/stetson.jpg" alt="" width="250" />Colin Stetson<br /><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17950-colin-stetson-new-history-warfare-vol-3/" target="_blank">New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light</a><br /></b><b>[Constellation]</b></p> <p>
Colin Stetson: &quot;High Above a Grey Green Sea&quot; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/constellation-records/high-above-a-grey-green-sea"> on SoundCloud</a>. </p> <p class="p1">Despite the consistently vast and overwhelming nature of the music that <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29454-colin-stetson/" target="_blank">Colin Stetson</a> has released over the last 11 years, it can be easy to forget him when it comes to listing what could be termed “big records,” the ones that come out of nowhere and shake you until you’re dumbstruck and limp. In the past 12 months, that list includes releases like <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/" target="_blank">Swans</a>’ <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16964-the-seer/" target="_blank"><i>The Seer</i></a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/" target="_blank">the Knife</a>’s <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17847-the-knife-shaking-the-habitual/" target="_blank"><i>Shaking the Habitual</i></a>, and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/" target="_blank">Deafhaven</a>’s <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18060-deafheaven-sunbather/" target="_blank"><i>Sunbather</i></a>. The final part of the Montreal saxophonist’s <i>New History Warfare</i> trilogy deserves to stand alongside any of those for its vanguard approach. <i>To See More Light</i> uses the same tools as 2011’s <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15166-new-history-of-warfare-vol-2-judges/" target="_blank"><i>Judges</i></a>, though switching the voices of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6912-shara-worden/" target="_blank">Shara Worden</a> and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/" target="_blank">Laurie Anderson</a> for <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5976-justin-vernon/" target="_blank">Justin Vernon</a> (on his best non-Bon Iver turn yet), but somehow pushes Stetson’s harrowing sound somewhere far more heartbreaking and desperate.</p> <p class="p1">The two things I admire most about Stetson are his willingness to eschew external narratives and imagery from his music and his ability to wring something profoundly moving and meditative from a bludgeoning palette. His torrent of howled vocals and steaming saxophone lines are couched within the percussion of his instrument’s keys, constructing a desperate vista something like a landmass broken apart by an earthquake. And although Stetson’s performance style would bust anyone else’s lungs for the sheer force of it, on <i>To See More Light</i>, he’s flexing more musical muscle; there are mercilessly manic attacks, elephantine bellows, yanked-away, bungee-tethered teases of catharsis, courtly, complex mournful filigrees. Listen to feel cleansed, and awed. --Laura Snapes</p> <hr /> <p><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/doldrums.jpg" alt="" width="250" />Doldrums</b><br /><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17646-doldrums-lesser-evil/" target="_blank"><b>Lesser Evil</b></a><br /><b>[Arbutus]</b></p> <p> <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="300" height="24" id="player-5770" name="player1"> <param name="movie" value="http://cdn.pitchfork.com/streaming-player/player.swf"> <param name="allowfullscreen" value="false"> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"> <param name="flashvars" value="file=05_Egypt.mp3&title=&quot;Egypt&quot;&lightcolor=EF4135&streamer=rtmp://s3w1mu85xbnhjc.cloudfront.net/cfx/st"> <embed id="player-5770" name="player-5770" src="http://cdn.pitchfork.com/streaming-player/player.swf" width="300" height="24" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="false" flashvars="file=05_Egypt.mp3&title=&quot;Egypt&quot;&lightcolor=EF4135&streamer=rtmp://s3w1mu85xbnhjc.cloudfront.net/cfx/st" />

</p> <p>On multiple levels (including the cover art), we're viewing <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1126-doldrums/" target="_blank">Doldrums</a> frontman Airick Woodhead through the prism of a broken computer screen on his full-length debut. The majority of <i>Lesser Evil </i>was recorded on a laptop borrowed from friend, collaborator, and fellow Montreal scene fixture Claire Boucher of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/" target="_blank">Grimes</a>, a narrative-establishing factoid that you're obligated to mention in 2013. But it's also an apt visual metaphor for Woodhead's sonic approach. Singles <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13479-egypt/" target="_blank">"Egypt"</a> and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14374-she-is-the-wave/" target="_blank">"She Is the Wave"</a> could've been straight-up electro-pop at one point, but they end up cracked, warped, and spiderwebbed as Woodhead throws in that one extra beat before the hook, an unexpected chord change or a yell that initially throws the entire thing off balance. To call it pop deconstruction sells it short; there are some masterfully crafted melodies underneath the yelping, while "Holographic Sandcastles" and "Sunrise" serve as gorgeous near-interludes that balance out the caffeinated, teeth-chattering highs. Doldrums<i> </i>is more of a pop contortionist that establishes a link to a decade prior when <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/" target="_blank">Black Dice</a> and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/" target="_blank">Animal Collective</a> were starting to emerge from their noisy origins into something that could convey the forward-thinking excitability of their local scene to the world at large. But while Woodhead may owe them a debt of gratitude, the truth is, from the sounds of <i><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16980-centipede-hz/" target="_blank">Centipede Hz</a> </i>and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16499-mr-impossible/" target="_blank"><i>Mr. Impossible</i></a>, those bands would've loved to call <i>Lesser Evil </i>their own. --Ian Cohen</p> <hr /> <p><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/inc.jpg" alt="" width="250" />Inc.</b><br /><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17625-teen-inc-no-world/" target="_blank"><b>no world</b></a><br /><b>[4AD]</b></p> <p><audio controls="controls"> <source src="http://pitchfork.com/player/download/5440/" type="audio/mpeg" /> Inc.: &quot;The Place&quot;

</p> <p>Among the worshippers gathered outside the temple of Sade is <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29728-teen-inc/" target="_blank">Inc.</a>, Los Angeles-based brothers who have piloted away from earlier, more <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15661-3-ep/" target="_blank">formative experimenting</a> (for a while, they operated under the name Teen Inc) and into <i>no world</i>, their full-length debut for 4AD. While it doesn't pop in the same places as the more heralded releases from like-minded artists Rhye or How to Dress Well, <i>no world </i>creates and sustains its own deliberately-downstated-but-also-somehow-kind-of-muscular sound. Opener "the place" helps render the placid pulse, a groove that never quite overpowers Andrew and Daniel Aged's whispery vocals but sometimes comes close, creating an interesting tension. Not every album is designed to knock you over; <i>no world </i>would rather sneak up on you. Notorious for being the studio equivalent of gym rats, the duo's layering and nuance pays off, revealing more on each listen. It'll take a few of those to get there, but it's worth the investment. --Corban Goble</p> <hr /> <p><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/howlin.jpg" alt="" width="250" />Jagwar Ma</b><br /><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18225-jagwar-ma-howlin/" target="_blank"><b>Howlin</b></a><br /><b>[Marathon Artists]</b></p> <p>
Jagwar Ma: &quot;The Throw&quot; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/jagwar-ma/the-throw/"> on SoundCloud</a>. </p> <p dir="ltr">Australian duo Jagwar Ma have, along with Temples, recently earned the (not always reputable) <a href="http://www.nme.com/news/jagwar-ma/69968" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">endorsement</a> of nascent Oasis man Noel Gallagher, and listening to their debut LP, <i>Howlin</i>, it's easy to understand why. Gabriel Winterfield and Jono Ma's heady mix of gauzy psychedelia and baggy beats are ear-candy for anyone who's ever gotten higher than the sun while listening to "Higher Than the Sun". The sound works so well, it's surprising it took a group this long to bring it back to the present day. But pegging <i>Howlin</i> as a pure nostalgia trip overlooks the more distinctive elements Jagwar Ma bring to the table. The record plays like a series of crashing waves, as the murkiness of every rolling tide ("Four", "Uncertainty") gives way to moments of simple psych-pop radiance ("That Loneliness", "Let Her Go"). At its best, this push-and-pull is reminiscent of last year's big-ticket candy-psych blowout, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/" target="_blank">Tame Impala</a>'s expansive <i><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17131-lonerism/" target="_blank">Lonerism</a>.</i> --Larry Fitzmaurice</p> <hr /> <p><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/jai.jpg" alt="" width="250" />Jai Paul</b><br /><b>Jai Paul</b><br /><b>[self-released]</b></p> <p>

The mystifying circumstances surrounding a collection of his songs that leaked this spring have only made his case murkier: late on a Saturday night in April, an album was offered for sale on BandCamp, containing 16 untitled tracks. By Monday, the album had been removed (it was said to be a collection of unfinished demos uploaded from a stolen laptop), and those who paid were to be offered a refund. We've not heard a word from Jai Paul since, but the music, whatever its source, has left us much to explore.  </p> <p dir="ltr">After many listens, I started to think that Jai Paul had woven secret messages into these songs-- small, abstract clues meant to provide listeners with a scavenger hunt of insights into his unorthodox approach to releasing music. "In the company of thieves, will I stay or will I leave?" he asks, almost pleading, through the muted percolation of the bass on the third track (none were given titles). "Will they steal away my life? Will I go down without a fight? I might." On one of the many sampled interstitial pieces, an unspecified woman explains that something "could almost melt in the mouth if cooked properly… but I like it <i>raw</i>." Could it be a reference to the jagged and unfinished nature of Jai Paul's songs, which sound like the seedlings of fuller-bodied hits? Is this a big conceptual art project for the producer, who might be winking at us the whole way through his virtuoso-recluse narrative?</p> <p dir="ltr">It's a melodramatic proposal, but you can't put it past someone with Jai Paul's level of savvy. He's someone who grabbed a big handful of contemporary sounds and talking points-- lo-fi laptop production, sample collages, appropriation of global music, outré R&amp;B, a shadowy online identity-- and spun them into one of the most spellbinding collection of songs (or non-songs) that's been released (or not released) this year.

"My work is not meant to keep people happy or give them an escape," Hval stated flatly in a Pitchfork interview. That may be true, but she also didn't set out to make an alienating record: the music on <i>Innocence Is Kinky</i> is beckoning and beautiful, one that takes full advantage of Hval's striking voice, which can be operatic or childlike or gothic depending on the song.

</p> <p><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30460-ken-mode/" target="_blank">KEN mode</a>'s name is an acronym for "Kill Everyone Now", frontman Jesse Matthewson has one of the most frightening glares you'll ever witness, and the Winnipeg trio's adamantium alloy of post-hardcore, punk, and metal could slice your head clean off like their fellow countryman Wolverine. But let's talk about brains for a second; not just in the context of the math-rock song structures or the surgical precision of their rhythm section. Pay close attention to the words underneath Matthewson's screech and you'll hear <i>Entrench </i>for what it is: one of the most lyrically righteous albums in any genre this year. </p> <p><i>Entrench </i>can definitely help you get through whatever shitty day you're having, but KEN mode ain't gonna hold your hand through it. <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14769-counter-culture-complex/" target="_blank">"Counter Culture Complex"</a> shouts down the condescension of liberal guilt with careening hooks, "Figure Your Life Out" and "Your Heartwarming Story Makes Me Sick" shout down the condescension encoded in society's expectation of upward mobility, while "Romeo Must Never Know" finds KEN mode internally bruised from all that shouting, a defeated tour diary entry where Matthewson spends another night sleeping next to litter boxes, wondering if things will ever be different.

</p> <p>"I don’t really have a writing process any more. I don’t know, If I was to tell you [how I come up with my material], I’d be lying."

The Baton Rouge rapper has developed a warm, fluid style that relies equally on singing as it does on rapping-- he has a wonderful ear for both. And either way, he always says exactly what he means: "What the fuck is up with these A&amp;Rs criticizing music they can't make?/ Poking fun at my struggle, I don't find shit funny, I live in places that ain't safe/ 2008, I got my leg blown off/ Any given day could get my head blow off," goes a typically bracing passage on "I Need It". Gates' career has some hard-luck vet notches in it-- there was some YMCMB time, some jail time-- but <i>Brasi </i>got him an Atlantic Records deal, which means exponentially more people will be given the chance to care about Gates in the near future.  --Jayson Greene</p> <p><!--pagebreak--></p> <p> </p> <p><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/MVULA.jpg" alt="" width="250" />Laura Mvula</b><br /><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17813-laura-mvula-sing-to-the-moon/" target="_blank"><b>Sing to the Moon</b></a><br /><b>[RCA]</b></p> <p>

But squint hard enough at the mist and these 12 songs start to feel less like fantasies than studies in hard-won realism; Mvula has a knack for capturing the precise moment when her down-but-not-out characters realize that the prince is a jerk and the fairy godmother is a no-show. But no matter: "I don't need love to rescue me," she sings on the sighing but resiliently punchy ballad "Make Me Lovely," which, like the album's other standouts "She", "Like the Morning Dew", and "Green Garden", showcases Mvula's signature trick of gracefully pivoting between between wistfulness and defiance. <i>Moon</i> is a multi-dimensional tour through the full range of Mvula's voice, which calls to mind the punchy grit of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5185-amy-winehouse/" target="_blank">Amy Winehouse</a>, the smoky poise of Nina Simone and the fleet-footed cool of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/10788-janelle-monae/" target="_blank">Janelle Monáe</a>, while still retaining an idiosyncratic personality of its own.

</p> <p dir="ltr"><i>Light Up Gold</i>, the whip-smart debut from Brooklyn-via-Texas jangle-punks <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/" target="_blank">Parquet Courts</a>, saw initial release in late 2012 but gained a wider audience when it was reissued by NYC lo-fi institution What's Yr Rupture?

Over the last three years, F&amp;G have released two full-lengths that place them squarely in the lineage of humor-heavy nerd-rock aesthetes like Ween and Sparks; Parquet Courts are similarly indebted to the past, with wiry guitar lines and sing-speak vocals that evoke 1970s NYC post-punk's stop-start tendencies.</p> <p>Parquet Courts are a funny band, too (check the oft-quoted line "Socrates died in the fucking gutter!"), but their sense of humor is less explicit and rooted in rock's backpages than Fergus &amp; Geronimo's über-referential joke-cracking. "<a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14678-stoned-and-starving/" target="_blank">Stoned and Starving</a>", for instance, is exactly what you'd expect given the title, with references to nervously scanning nutritional labels in an altered state.

Pharmakon: &quot;Crawling on Bruised Knees&quot; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/sacredbones/pharmakon-crawling-on-bruised"> on SoundCloud</a>. </p> <p>Whitehouse, Swans, Prurient-- you needn't be familiar with any entry into the abrasive trajectory of power electronics and noise to understand Pharmakon. The project is helmed by 23-year-old New Yorker Margaret Chardiet, and her <i>Abandon</i> LP is hellish, unnerving electronic noise that looks you in the eye, the brutal vulnerability of Chardiet exorcising what's boiled inside her. There is terror and despair and an engrossing industrial pulse to this deeply confrontational music-- an alarm that summons you to move, tied by skyward death screams that are punishing like Michael Gira. "It is human connection," Chardiet says of Pharmakon's core. "Inspiration is not just the music I listen to or literature I read. What inspires you to think? Why are you a human and not an ape? That is inspiration."</p> <p>Recently a friend told me that while he'd enjoyed Pharmakon's intense live show, he couldn't imagine a specific context in everyday life when it would seem natural to play <i>Abandon</i> through headphones. But there is no one place. I've made a habit of putting <i>Abandon</i> on while traveling to Manhattan during rush hour. Amidst the chaos, I am made so acutely present and connected to my surroundings while simultaneously feeling as though I exist in another dimension of Chardiet's doing. "Bound to/ A vision/ I have not yet/ Created," she screams as the record closes, but <i>Abandon</i> helps you better see things as they really are. <br />--Jenn Pelly</p> <hr /> <p><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/power-trip.jpg" alt="" width="250" />Power Trip<br /><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17893-power-trip-manifest-decimation/" target="_blank">Manifest Decimation</a></b><br /><b>[Southern Lord]</b></p> <p> <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="300" height="24" id="player-7003" name="player1"> <param name="movie" value="http://cdn.pitchfork.com/streaming-player/player.swf"> <param name="allowfullscreen" value="false"> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"> <param name="flashvars" value="file=01_1._Manifest_Decimation_Vinyl.mp3&title=&quot;Manifest Decimation&quot;&lightcolor=EF4135&streamer=rtmp://s3w1mu85xbnhjc.cloudfront.net/cfx/st"> <embed id="player-7003" name="player-7003" src="http://cdn.pitchfork.com/streaming-player/player.swf" width="300" height="24" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="false" flashvars="file=01_1._Manifest_Decimation_Vinyl.mp3&title=&quot;Manifest Decimation&quot;&lightcolor=EF4135&streamer=rtmp://s3w1mu85xbnhjc.cloudfront.net/cfx/st" />

</p> <div><br />Dallas thrash/hardcore band <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31190-power-trip/" target="_blank">Power Trip</a> had been together for a while prior to making <i>Manifest Decimation</i>, and they had a few practical reasons to hold off on making an album right away. (They had some drummer changes and Blake Ibanez spent a year away at school.) But before they got in the studio for their first proper full-length, frontman Riley Gale and guitarist Ibanez kept busy by compiling potential sounds for their first album. “He and I literally have folders full of riffs,” Gale <a href="http://www.thesickpeople.com/interview-riley-gale-power-trip/" target="_blank" title="This external link will open in a new window" rel="nofollow">said</a>. That definitely shows on <i>Manifest Decimation,</i> an eight-song LP that overflows with guitar heroics. They string together solos and hooks that could’ve been ripped from Pantera, Van Halen, Bad Brains, Metallica, Motorhead, Cro-Mags, Agnostic Front, or Discharge. With its blistering speed metal, it’s an awesomely treacherous record. And it offers a lot more than just thrown horns, gang vocals, and pit fodder. It’s thoughtfully arranged, too, with bleak spoken word samples from films like <i>Blood Simple</i> (“what I know about is Texas, and down here, you’re on your own”) and an ambient, ethereal outro on “The Hammer of Doubt”.

</p> <p>Longtime followers of Dominic Fernow like to point out how the sprawling, unwieldy discography of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/" target="_blank">Prurient</a> has no definitive document or easy entry point. <i>Through the Window </i>might not be either of those, but it's certainly the most accessible thing Fernow's done outside of his former band <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave/" target="_blank">Cold Cave</a>, following in the path pointed out by 2011's <i><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16006-times-arrow/" target="_blank">Time's Arrow</a> </i>for a half hour where his noise past and electronic future reach a fascinating, unsettling armistice. Bookended by 10-minute masterworks of mesmeric rhythms and charred textures, <i>Through the Window </i>grants Prurient some timely peers - you could safely recommend this to someone who wished Haxan Cloak had beats or that Burial conveyed terror more than dread. But it's hard not to think of "Terracotta Spine" as a definitive Prurient moment after all, as Fernow bisects <i>Through the Window </i>with a screeching assault of splattered noise and blood on the dance floor. --Ian Cohen</p> <hr /> <p><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/sandwell-district.jpg" alt="" width="250" />Sandwell District</b><br /><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18048-sandwell-district-fabric-69/" target="_blank"><b>Fabric 69</b></a><br /><b>[Fabric]</b></p> <p dir="ltr">Over the last decade, the darkly shaded techno collective<a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18048-sandwell-district-fabric-69/"> Sandwell District</a> picked up where key member Regis' 1990s label Downwards left off. Their music has drawn heavily from post-punk and industrial's bracing din and dub techno's tunnel-vision atmosphere while techno as a whole veered toward more minimal concerns. Sandwell District released the kind of dance music that would sound at home soundtracking a horror film as well as it worked on the dance floor, and the intricate, exquisitely produced Fabric 69 is a summation of that aesthetic.</p> <p dir="ltr">S-D main men Regis and Function, who have toured under the name since the label's shuttering at the end of 2011, stitched together 30 tracks over 75 minutes, and the result is a harrowing yet deeply luxurious work that, like all great mixes, begs to be heard from start to finish. As they've said on the collective's website for a while now, Sandwell District is dead, and a recent<a href="http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1842" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Resident Advisor feature</a> painted the pair's current working relationship as strained, suggesting that this very may well be the end for the foreseeable future; Regis himself has already moved on with James Ruskin and fellow S-D associate Silent Servant in the form of a new label, Jealous God. As the noisier areas of experimental music continue to turn their ears towards the dancefloor, then, <i>Fabric 69</i> ties a bow around the past while pointing towards the future of all things that go "thump" in the night. --Larry Fitzmaurice</p> <hr /> <p><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/torres.jpg" alt="" width="250" />Torres</b><br /><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17558-torres/" target="_blank"><b>Torres</b></a><br /><b>[self-released]</b></p> <p>
Torres: &quot;Honey&quot; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/torres-23/honey"> on SoundCloud</a>. </p> <p class="p1">Anyone can smear danger out of aggression, but teasing it from weary silence takes a rare talent. <i>Torres</i>, the debut album from 22-year-old Nashville resident Mackenzie Scott, wreaks its devastation with just her voice and electric guitar, with occasional backing from a slight band. “Fool me once and I won’t make a sound/ Fool me twice, there’s shame to go around,” she sings on “Chains”, a song with the menacing grace of a match being skimmed over a barrel of oil. It ends with her scratching down her instrument’s fretboard as if snapping someone’s spine one vertebrae at a time, before the whole thing implodes with a jerk, Scott seemingly noosed from behind with her own amp cable. The circular, disturbed acoustic rush of “Come to Terms” feels like standing in the middle of a dusty, rumbling freeway, tempting fate; the subdued static warp on closer, suicide ballad “Waterfall”, smuggles a feeling of utterly crushed hopelessness into your gut.</p> <p class="p1">One of <i>Torres</i>’ most spellbinding qualities is the way these songs live with extremes-- of heartbreak, regret, revenge-- but exercise control so convincing that they seem like manageable, everyday emotional states. On the first couple of listens, <i>Torres</i> may sound guileless and raw; yet listen harder to a song like “Jealousy and I”, where her low, tangled guitar line pools with reverb, echoes of the original performance lapping against one another. “Jealousy and I, we’re two of a kind,” Scott sings, accepting the destructive emotion as part of her loving manner, her voice taking on the same refracted, swimmy quality as her guitar. It’s Scott’s gimlet eye that makes <i>Torres</i> so captivating. “I wanna tell you everything,” she sings on “Don’t Run Away, Emilie”. “I’ll be the truest one you know, if you stay a while.” Like all the best psychological thrillers, it’s hard to look away. --Laura Snapes</p> <hr /> <p><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/tree.jpg" alt="" width="250" />Tree</b><br /><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18133-tree-sunday-school-ii-when-church-lets-out/" target="_blank"><b>Sunday School II: When Church Lets Out</b></a><br /><b>[Creative Control]</b></p> <p>
Tree: &quot;The King&quot; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/mctreeg/the-king"> on SoundCloud</a>. </p> <p>In his <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18133-tree-sunday-school-ii-when-church-lets-out/" target="_blank">Pitchfork review</a>, Miles Raymer smartly tagged Tree as "something like the David Banner of the Midwest."  It's a perfect reference point for the Chicago rapper/producer: Imagine a David Banner who was never torn to pieces in vain pursuit of a pop crossover, one who was always as confident and impassioned as the guy on "Cadillacs on 22's", and you're in Tree's neighborhood. </p> <p><i>Sunday School II</i> is the self-described "soul-trap" artist's high-water mark so far, as musical and accomplished a rap mixtape as has been released this year. Tree is an incredible producer, adept at warping recognizable samples into unfamiliar, startling shapes--  hear what he does to Elvis's "Can't Help Fallin In Love" on <i>Sunday School II</i>'s "King" and marvel at it-- and at manipulating tension with unpredictable drum-pad rhythms. His voice has a ragged edge and a hint of a wry smile in it, which softens his harder lyrics and deepens his thoughtful ones. Calling him "soulful" feels pat, but there's no other word for music this sincere and personal. --Jayson Greene</p> <hr /> <p><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/william-tyler.jpg" alt="" width="250" />William Tyler</b><br /><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17780-william-tyler-impossible-truth/" target="_blank"><b>Impossible Truth</b></a><br /><b>[Merge]</b></p> <p>
William Tyler: &quot;Country of Illusion&quot; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/tompkinssquare/country-of-illusion-by-william"> on SoundCloud</a>. </p> <p>If someone listens to only one instrumental guitar record in 2013, there's a good chance it's going to be <i>Impossible Truth</i> -- being on the same label as <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/" target="_blank">Arcade Fire</a> and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3916-spoon/" target="_blank">Spoon</a> gets you an unusual amount of exposure in this realm. But unlike most crossover records functioning outside of pop, William Tyler's second album doesn't capitalize on some ineffable star quality or serve as a substitute for the entirety of the genre. Tyler's prodigious skills impress the connoisseur and welcome the newcomer, reverential and idiosyncratic in equal measure. This isn't outre stuff-- in fact, if you've heard Led Zeppelin's "Bron-Yr-Aur", the fluid fingerpicking, sprightly melodies and open-tuned drones will ring familiar.</p> <p>A gorgeously recorded album, <i>Impossible Truth's </i>pure sound is immaculate, rightfully putting the focus on Tyler's fingers, which evoke a lyricism and emotional evocativeness that escapes most bands <i>with </i>vocals. There's a sweet, searching playfulness to <i>Impossible Truth</i>, as Tyler sets scenes (<a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14671-cadillac-desert/" target="_blank">"Cadillac Desert"</a>, "Hotel Catatonia") and lets you tell the story. Have you ever come up with poetry, lyrics or just a warm sentiment to a loved one you wanted to express, but couldn't find the right musical vessel for them? There's a good chance you'll find it on <i>Impossible Truth. </i>--Ian Cohen</p>

The first time I heard it, I was transported. The world stopped. There’s a moment where the choir comes in-- it’s just the most unexpected instrument in any song. It changes key like an M.C. Escher staircase, leading back into the beginning and then suddenly there’s this angelic voice and an incredible sadness.</p> <p><object width="624" height="350" bgcolor="#000000" data="http://videoplayer.vevo.com/embed/embedded?videoId=GB0408801804&amp;playlist=false&amp;autoplay=0&amp;playerId=62FF0A5C-0D9E-4AC1-AF04-1D9E97EE3961&amp;playerType=embedded&amp;env=0&amp;siteSection=pitchfork_pitchfork.com&amp;sbId=22c4de93-74df-4b1b-a4b2-4d874446b8e0&amp;enableDomScan=true&amp;endScreen=play" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://videoplayer.vevo.com/embed/embedded?videoId=GB0408801804&amp;playlist=false&amp;autoplay=0&amp;playerId=62FF0A5C-0D9E-4AC1-AF04-1D9E97EE3961&amp;playerType=embedded&amp;env=0&amp;siteSection=pitchfork_pitchfork.com&amp;sbId=22c4de93-74df-4b1b-a4b2-4d874446b8e0&amp;enableDomScan=true&amp;endScreen=play" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><div id="fw_300x60" style="background:black;width:575px;height:relative;position:relative;top:-6px;text-align:center;"><form id="_fw_form_comp_300x60" style="display:none"><input type="hidden" name="_fw_input_comp_300x60" id="_fw_input_comp_300x60" value="ptgt=p&amp;envp=g_iframe_js&amp;slid=comp_300x60&amp;w=300&amp;h=60&amp;slau=300x60_Companion1|300x60" /></form></div></object></p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Dream Merch Table Item</b></p> <p dir="ltr">I’d like something edible, maybe a cake that has some sort of embedded musical content. And we can put my face on the front of the cake! I need to think this through a bit more.</p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Favorite Cereal</b></p> <p dir="ltr">I take breakfast quite seriously... and I don’t believe cereal features in a serious breakfast. [<i>laughs</i>] I’m a bit snobbish about breakfast: eggs benedict, or eggs royale, or something like that. Or just some really amazing, proper brown toast with smoked salmon, lemon, and black pepper. That’s a great start to the day. Cereal feels like scrapings of something, you know? It doesn’t taste unpleasant, but I find it insubstantial. It doesn’t do the job. </p> <p dir="ltr"><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/canadaz.jpg" alt="" />Last Album I Downloaded</b></p> <p dir="ltr"><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18104-boards-of-canada-tomorrows-harvest/">Boards of Canada's <i>Tomorrow's Harvest</i></a>. When I first heard it, I was underwhelmed-- it’s just been such an enormous gap between albums. But my mind wants to keep going back to it. And that’s what they’ve always done: They have this way of communicating with the subconscious, and that’s what really interests me about them. The inquisitive part of my mind goes, "What is it about this?" I don’t even know the answer, but I just know that I want to keep going back to it.</p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Dream Tattoo</b></p> <p dir="ltr">I always liked the idea of shaving the back of my head and getting a tattoo of my own face there so that, whichever way I was looking, I could freak people out. I could grow a beard on the back <i>and</i> the front of my head. The possibilities are endless! [<i>laughs</i>]</p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Best Thing I’ve Bought in the Past Year</b></p> <p dir="ltr">I got this pretend grass stuff called LazyLawn on my roof. Now I can go out on my terrace in bare feet, and it looks exactly like a lawn. This is what science should be for.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/gunFsBQVYGw?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Dumbest Thing I’ve Bought in the Past Year</b></p> <p dir="ltr">This expensive maroon shirt. It looked beautiful in the shop, but when I put it on later, I realized it’s made out of this ridiculous material that creases immediately. By the end of the first night wearing it, I looked like a bright-red Michelin Man. It’s not being worn again.</p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Biggest Pet Peeve</b></p> <p dir="ltr">I was introduced to this idea of live record reviews-- someone did one for me on Twitter-- and the idea of listening to an album and tweeting about it as you go through it on your first listen offends me on so many levels. This is not how music is supposed to be listened to. Nobody wrote an album with that in mind. I’m not a huge internet person in that I find the sheer speed and updating of everything not good for the attention span. I don’t think it’s natural.</p> <p dir="ltr"><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/jitter.jpg" alt="" />Last Great Book I Read</b></p> <p dir="ltr"><b></b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitterbug_Perfume" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Jitterbug Perfume</i></a> by Tom Robbins. It’s a surreal journey about the search for the missing note in a fragrance that will open consciousness. It also sums up this guy’s views on humanity and religion and sex-- he just has completely different angle on the world.</p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Favorite Director</b> </p> <p dir="ltr"><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/">David Lynch</a></p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Favorite TV Show</b></p> <p dir="ltr">"Twin Peaks"</p> <p><b>Favorite New Artist</b> </p> <p dir="ltr"><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/31068-evenings/">Evenings</a></p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Favorite Drink</b></p> <p dir="ltr">Camden Pale Ale</p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Role Model</b></p> <p dir="ltr"><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/">Brian Eno</a>. And not just with his music, but in the way he lives his life. He has a great approach, just making sure everything stays fun and not allowing things to get boring. Varying activities hugely from week to week. I’ve always been really into that.</p> <p>He’s a funny person to work with. He always gets a white board out and starts writing things on it and pointing at them when you’re playing-- he quite often writes "stop playing." When me, him, and Leo Abrahams made <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14828-small-craft-on-a-milk-sea/"><i>Small Craft on a Milk Sea</i></a>, he would have us all playing and then he would have certain instructions written down, and that's how he would direct the improvisations. It introduces accidents and forces the music to be open to things that weren't going to be done if the musicians were playing on their own free will.</p> <p>On my first meeting with him-- when I was 23 and very nervous over lunch-- I asked him, "Where do you record when you record with U2?" He’s just like, "Oh, I don’t want to talk about that." He keeps these other things completely separate in his mind. I understand that now that I’m doing lots of different types of projects myself. You have to keep barriers in your head, otherwise everything’s just going on all the time. I didn’t really ask him a question like that again. Occasionally, he’ll let something slip about <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/">David Bowie</a>. He talks about his email communications with Bowie, which are read out sometimes, and they’re the funniest things I’ve ever heard. Very, very surreal. I can’t really go into any details, though.</p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Last Great Film I Saw</b></p> <p dir="ltr"><b></b>I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Groundhog Day</i></a> again. People always laugh when I tell them how much I love it, but I genuinely think it’s profoundly brilliant. It’s the most warm and welcoming film, and it's got quite a philosophical story: The idea of waking up with the same behavior everyday for 10,000 years--there’s depth to it.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/tSVeDx9fk60?rel=0" width="624" height="468" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Bad Habit</b></p> <p dir="ltr">I have the inability to stop thinking and switch off from work at night, which causes a lot of sleeplessness. It can be seen as a bad habit because, if I take some days off, I become a much nicer person. But I definitely work too hard even when I’m not making music-- part of my brain is always ticking away with something. That’s not the way to live. It gets you out of the present because you're always thinking ahead or behind.</p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Favorite Video Game</b></p> <p dir="ltr"><i>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> on the N64. I remember playing that when I was 18 and didn’t have a job. I’d been in Imogen Heap’s band and we lost funding, so I was unemployed. I spent about six months playing it in such depth. I was wandering around those fields looking for those fucking spiders. It was like my whole world. I was obsessed with the detail of it. It also was before graphics were so incredible, so you still had to imagine a bit yourself. I didn’t feel the need to play anything after that.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_NElFLzgdUs?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Worst Nightmare</b></p> <p dir="ltr">It's a thing that might actually be happening: The world warming up due to exponentially increasing CO2 levels. I don’t want to make some huge point about it, but it’s being ignored at such an amazing level. We’re worrying about the most trivial things when the actual life-support systems we depend on are being disrupted. Either science is going to come to the rescue or we’re going to see some pretty interesting times. It was part of the inspiration for certain tracks on my album. If you travel a lot, you can’t help but think about it sometimes. It can’t all continue to grow forever. There isn’t enough.</p> <p dir="ltr"><b><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/insigz.jpg" alt="" />Last Record You Played</b></p> <p dir="ltr"><i>Insignificance</i> by <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/">Jim O’Rourke</a></p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Favorite Board Game</b></p> <p dir="ltr">Monopoly. I’m quite old-school with that.</p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Last Meal I Ate</b></p> <p>I cooked a very nice red lentil dahl with Indian curry spices and pilau rice for lunch. Very simple, but good. I’m very seriously into food and I don’t like to waste any meals.</p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Best Birthday I Ever Had</b></p> <p dir="ltr">When I was six years old, I went to this random, rusty theme park called Thorpe Park. They had two roller coasters, one of which was called Space Station Zero, which was very transparently a rubbish version of Space Mountain. But as a kid, I was so excited by it-- to the point that I was nearly sick. I don’t remember ever being as excited about anything in my life since that day. You know how it is.</p> <p dir="ltr"><b>First Record I Bought for Myself</b></p> <p dir="ltr">Wet Wet Wet’s <i>Sweet Little Mystery</i>. I can explain. I was about seven years old and I’d saved up a little pocket money and went into the Woolworths, where I used to get records. I didn’t really know what to buy, but on the front cover of the Wet Wet Wet album there was a guy with a synth, and I thought: "This'll sound great." It wasn’t the case. </p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/uyUtpqG8i_k?rel=0" width="624" height="468" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Strangest Display of Affection from a Fan</b></p> <p dir="ltr">I did a gig in St. Petersburg, and this girl had hand-drawn an enormous poster of my face. She was just holding it up in front of me, and my reaction was to start laughing. The whole thing was just so strange. I always find hand-drawn pictures or photos of me to be hilarious. I’m not into that as a whole concept, really.</p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Dream Collaboration</b></p> <p dir="ltr">Mark Hollis from Talk Talk is probably my favorite vocalist of all time. I would love to collaborate with him. Also Jónsi from <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/">Sigur Rós</a>. I think that’s something that a lot of people would say, but I really mean it. [<i>laughs</i>] But if it’s in terms of artists living or dead, then <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2689-john-martyn/">John Martyn</a> at his late 70s, early 80s peak would probably be my #1.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/pYLVM560Fok?rel=0" width="624" height="468" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Easiest Money I’ve Ever Made</b></p> <p dir="ltr">There isn’t much easy money making in music. There was a point a few years ago where I did a commercial for Honda, and it was an artistically beautiful thing to work on, so it was quite easy to agree to. I spent maybe two days on it and it paid off my entire record-deal debt. I don’t get involved in that kind of thing very often, but sometimes it’s for the artistic good.</p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Favorite Music Video</b></p> <p dir="ltr">It’s actually Aiofe McArdle’s video that was done for my last single, "Open Eye Signal". I was wondering whether that was arrogant or not and then I realized I didn’t have anything to do with it, so I think I can say that. I’ve never seen such a good representation of a piece of music. He completely nailed it, with the skateboarder that just skates to be nowhere.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Q04ILDXe3QE?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Favorite "Simpsons" Episode</b></p> <p dir="ltr">The one where Homer eats the hottest chili, and it goes into this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHGHvP-xRsg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">beautifully surreal sequence that goes on for quite a long time</a>-- almost like bizarre Dalí-esque trippiness. I love it when they really let their imaginations go. </p> <p><b>Favorite Comedian</b></p> <p dir="ltr">Stewart Lee. I don’t know if he ever leaves the UK, but he is incredible. Incredibly hostile. He deconstructs the whole idea of standup comedy whilst he’s doing it. He has this habit of repeating things endlessly-- you’re almost hypnotized by it. You leave one of his shows feeling somehow transformed, not necessarily in a good way, but it’s an amazing experience.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/R1p9KAW2tuE?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p dir="ltr"><b>Chicken or Shrimp</b></p> <p dir="ltr">Probably the toughest question so far. I was in New York recently and I got really addicted to these amazing shrimp tacos. But it’s gonna have to be chicken. Something about the perfect roast chicken actually makes your entire world feel better for the time that you’re eating it.</p>

</p> <p class="p1"><i><span class="s1"><small>Photo by <a href="http://shawnbrackbill.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shawn Brackbill</a></small></span></i></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/22489-zomby/">Zomby</a></span> might be one of dance music's biggest <a href="https://twitter.com/ZombyMusic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">social-media loudmouths</a>-- "<span class="s2">it's great to be good at something... but it's even better to have style," went a typical recent tweet-- </span>but as far as interviews are concerned, the producer is notoriously enigmatic, largely preferring to speak to journalists exclusively via iChat. To put his mysteriousness into perspective: Even now, five years after his debut, his real name remains unknown. So when I initially reached out to wrangle a face-to-face meet-up with the UK expat in New York City to talk about his impressionistic new album, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18183-zomby-with-love/"><span class="s1"><i>With Love</i></span></a><i>, </i>I was surprised to hear that he was, in fact, receptive.</p> <p class="p1">Still, there were complications. "Do you use a tape recorder? If so, is it necessary?" Zomby's publicist asked me in an e-mail. I gamely agreed to "obscure" my digital recorder so that it wouldn't be in his line of sight, a satisfactory concession. His rep went on to warn me that punctuality isn't Zomby's strong suit. As it turns out, I spend nearly a month scheduling and unscheduling interviews with the producer in the NYC area-- at least a dozen times, by my count. At one point, it's suggested that I accompany him to a tattoo parlor while he gets some new ink, while another blown appointment carried the promise of catching up with him at Manhattan fad-dining spot The Meatball Shop.</p> <p class="p1">Finally, a date is nailed down in early June, and I head to Manhattan's Bowery Hotel to meet with Zomby and his publicist-- but, naturally, only one of them shows up. After an hour waiting in the lobby, we learn that Zomby wants us to meet him at a spiffy-looking burger joint. We hoof over... to find that the place doesn't open for another hour. Another text from Zomby tells us to head to a bar across the street. We do. Nobody's there.</p> <p class="p1">We're in the middle of ordering conciliatory drinks when a tall, slightly skulking figure walks in. It's him. Sporting a pristine high fade and a baggy array of dark-colored clothing (including, as he's eager to tell me later, <a href="https://twitter.com/ZombyMusic/status/351751977039958016" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Marc Jacobs</span> Margiela</a> sweatpants), he shakes my hand and orders a drink. As the two of us walk to a sunlit area of the bar, he's already attempting to cover his tracks in the name of elusiveness, asking that I not mention where the interview is taking place in my article. "Manhattan" is about as close as he wants me to get. He says this with a conditional seriousness, as if there are great matters at stake.</p> <p class="p1">Zomby moved to NYC shortly after the release of 2011's elegiac <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15617-dedication/"><span class="s1"><i>Dedication</i></span></a>, starting in Brooklyn before moving to the Lower East Side, and then gradually making his way uptown. He claims that he's enjoyed exploring the city over the last 18 months, but when pressed on his favorite locales, his answer-- upscale fashion mainstays Bergdorf Goodman and Barney's-- befits the style-obsessed side of himself he's allowed to trickle out online. "As you get older, your taste gets more expensive, so to accommodate that, you enter a bit of a vicious cycle," he explains. "I joked on Twitter that I bought a new Lambo to drive up to another Lambo. Just one’s good, though-- I’d be happy with just the one I needed."</p> <p class="p1">After meeting him in person, one of the most concrete things I can say about Zomby is that he's very committed to keeping his aura as foggy as possible. He can be talkative if you go at him enough, but he's also not the brazen wiseguy he makes himself out to be on the internet. He describes the title of <i>With Love</i> as "an open gesture," but his speech patterns are anything but. He swallows the end of sentences by mumbling, and occasionally covers his face with his hand so that it's hard to hear what he's saying over the medium-volume bar stereo. When I ask him questions that veer away from his preferred topics-- music, his new 3D-printed mask made by visual designer <a href="http://www.bendrury.com/work/3d-mask/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ben Drury</a>, Twitter-- and more towards his personal ideologies, he laughs heartily and doesn't say anything for a few minutes before waving his hand: "next."</p> <p class="p1">In certain circles of musical culture, playing with notions of identity is now clichéd, but the practice of anonymity has strong roots in dance music's history, another facet of Zomby's frequently retro-fitted artistic outlook. So, essentially, it's a pose. Which is fine. But the level of Zomby's forced inscrutability can seem excessive: His bristling against simple questions regarding almost anything personal can make it seem less like he's hiding something and more like he's got nothing to hide.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p1">"I always wished that fashion magazines <br />would cover the faces of all the models."</p> </blockquote> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Around the time of <i>Dedication</i>, you said you wanted to take your sound in a more pop direction, but that's not the case with this new record.</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Zomby: Yeah, I just made it for myself. There comes a point when you’re arranging and writing stuff where you realize you’ve shifted the palette into something completely different. Like, there's Linkin Park or whatever the fuck, where the arrangements are all the fucking same. And once you naturally come to that point yourself, you’re like, "Fucking hell, I can actually have a quite cheesy tune." That’s not a good thing to do. I decided to go the other way and ended up with music that sounded fucking different. I don’t want to be known for having one or two huge tracks that I could push as hits.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: <i>With Love</i>'s "Isis" is the closest you've come to making a straight house track, a genre that quite a few producers are turning to again lately.</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Z: In England there's a big house revival. Disco, too, which is partly coming from progressions in software that make it easier to make "authentic" disco-- an achievement in itself, and well-timed with the Daft Punk record. That stuff's lost on me, though. I’m not a big disco fan. I grew up with jungle and hip-hop and garage and grime. Also, I'm not a big nostalgist. I don’t want to end up in an antique shop for music. We should try to keep it moving forward.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: You say you're not a nostalgist, but a lot of your work draws heavily from sounds of the past.</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Z: Yeah, well, that's from my life. That's not nostalgia. Nostalgia, to me, is a poster of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Best" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">George Best</a> holding up the World Cup. It's really good seeing nostalgia though, like, Wu-Tang to American kids. They love it, don't they? Walking around in shell-toes and Wu Wear T-shirts. </p> <p class="p1"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/E5fccx15b2k?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: The second disc of <i>With Love</i> sounds very sad to me.</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Z: I'd say it sounds thoughtful. It does have an emotive quality that a lot of things don’t. If you make a club track, it immediately doesn’t have that quality. If you free yourself from all intentions, you're left with this lost sound from when someone gave a fuck about music. Some shit on the radio sounds so bright, like a light bulb that's constantly on. The shit’s flickering-- and, fucking hell, you really notice it. </p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Do you consider yourself a happy person?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Z: I do, but I don’t think people around me would say the same. [<i>laughs</i>] Obviously, shit happens in life. Music’s a bitch, because when you’re thinking about working-- or even when you’re not working-- you seem ignorant and half-asleep as soon as you walk through the door. You're hardly the guy cracking jokes, so you seem sad, but you’re just lost in music.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CgPRVTHAnds?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: As an artist, you're consumed with maintaining anonymity as an image, but on Twitter you're very much the opposite of that ethos. </b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Z: Twitter is hilarious. It’s just funny to broadcast whatever the fuck, or actually engage with people. But not really-- you don’t want to engage with some nutcase. That’s my only interaction with anything online. I don’t use the internet. I’m not on Facebook. But Twitter is just a little window for updates, shit to post. It’s sweet, because now my online representation is just a very easily maintained box for me to type some shit in.</p> <p class="p1">I’d like to not have to deal with any of that stuff, but if it's a matter of somebody else dealing with it instead, I will deal with it. I don’t feel all that shit is important. I do realize that some people feel that everything you say on the internet is factual, like a documentary-- but it’s the internet, it’s whatever. You can get yourself into some shit and find yourself talking about all kinds of stupid things. I’m social, but not to the point where I’m updating all my friends constantly on all this shit. I don’t have a problem with those kind of people-- I get it, there's a big group of friends chatting up and having a great time and everyone has cameras-- I'm just not that kind of person. Really, I’m the only one mad enough to be on Twitter all the time blasting all this shit. You don’t see many of my peers doing that.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: You've established yourself as style-conscious in terms of fashion, but you're equally interested in mostly obscuring your physical appearance-- those two ideas seemingly don't go hand-in-hand, either.</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Z: I always wished that fashion magazines would cover the faces of all the models. If I wasn't covering my face with a mask, it’d probably be some kind of Hermes scarf instead.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Are you afraid that your online persona detracts people from listening to your music?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Z: There’s a big chance of alienating people. But there was a point where I realized genres are changing really fast, and I’d see people slamming things that I liked or I’ve been a part of. Someone’s gotta say something. I keep trying to quit Twitter. Obviously, at the moment it’s a bit difficult, since I'm putting the record out. Maybe I’ll just stop, though.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FXyA-hv5IxA?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: You're a dance artist on 4AD, which is historically more of an indie rock label. Are there any benefits or drawbacks to being signed with them as opposed to a more traditional dance imprint?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Z: It’s very healthy. I don’t have to adhere to any dance or electronic structures. I can compose anything and pass it off, and they’ll listen to it. The last thing you want to do is be on a label where every track you send in needs to have two-minute drum intros for DJs, remixes, no samples, this and that. I’m lucky to have such freedom. I can definitely do two-minute tracks, eight-minute tracks, tracks with vocals, no vocal features, whatever I want. I’m lucky, too, because other artists on the label are different-- if you’re on a label where all the music is very similar, you end up with labelmates where everybody’s playing the violin or some shit.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: How much attention are you paying to the UK dance scene while living in New York?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Z: I buy the records, but apart from making my own stuff and sending it back there, I can't really take part in it. I mean, I could fly over there, but I choose not to. I live here now. I'm not in a rush to board a seven-hour flight and go back. I once stood in passport control for three hours, which was pretty frustrating. I’ve not caught a plane for about six months.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Some say that New York City is a good place for loners.</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Z: When I work a lot here, I disappear, which is nice. People are really social in New York, though. I’ve never been anywhere else where people just talk to each other in the street. You'll be getting your coffee and having a conversation about some shit that’s happening in Syria. But there’s a lot of places to disappear off to for work, too, so there's less distractions.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Are you constantly creating music?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Z: Off and on. When I'm writing stuff, I realize that I'm self-employed, and it sinks in: "I'm working now." Sometimes I get bored and do nothing that's really exciting, just fuck around.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: How much material did you have to choose from while putting together <i>With Love</i>?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Z: Loads. My whole game is to try to hold everything off until the last minute-- until the day it's mastered, I'm sending in new tracks. When you think that way, you always have the mind of a 15-year-old child.</p>

My dad worked in the aviation industry, while my mom worked in a primary school, helping children with learning difficulties. We didn’t have a car, so I mainly heard music at home, which is how my interest in vinyl began. My dad would listen to rock'n'roll compilations like the <i>American Graffiti </i>soundtrack. I remember listening to classical music and making up stories to go along with it, and then acting the stories out in front of my parents: An evil guy would tie up a beautiful woman to the train tracks, and I would rescue her. Embarrassing stuff.</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5-10-15-20_10.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p1"><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/Soul-II-Soul-Get-A-Life-58412.jpg" alt="" /><b>Soul II Soul: "Get a Life" 7"</b></p> <p class="p1">South London was a rough place to grow up in the 1990s. Lots of drugs and violence, and there was always the possibility of being mugged or beaten up by a gang. It was just something you had to avoid. Going home from school, I had to plan my route so I didn’t run into a gang of guys who were going to fuck me up. And I wasn’t a tough person, either. I cried easily, which made me more vulnerable to any kind of insult. I couldn’t deal with it. And there were people getting shot in the head at point-blank range on the street. When I was really young, someone smashed up our neighbor's motorbike, so the guy went in his house, put a balaclava on, held a gun sideways-- like in a film-- and shot at a car that was driving by his house. It was completely scary.</p> <p class="p1">When I was about 12, jungle was happening. My friend’s dad used to bring rave records home, and me and my friend would play with Legos and tape things off [pirate radio station] Choice FM, which played a lot of reggae and dance. I wanted to get Soul II Soul's "Get a Life"<i> </i>7”, but they only had chart stuff at the local Woolworths, so I knew it wouldn’t be in there, because it was too cool. But there was a record shop on Peckham High St., so I went in and there were all these guys with dreadlocks, and a big dub system playing all these brilliant records. My dad’s with me, and he goes [<i>high voice</i>], "Oi, mate, do you have Soul II Soul?" "Yeah, man, we got that." That was my first record. I still have it.</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5-10-15-20_15.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p1"><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/aphex300.jpg" alt="" /><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"><b>Aphex Twin</b></a></p> <p class="p1">When I was 15, we moved to Chelmsford, in Essex, where <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3921-squarepusher/">Squarepusher</a> is from. When I got there, the biggest shock was that all my classmates were white-- whereas in South London, it was me and maybe three other [white] people. Everyone was listening to Pulp, Oasis, and Blur. Where I was from, that was referred to as "batty man" music, gay music. No one listened to that rubbish-- no one even <i>talked</i> about guitar music around me before I was in Chelmsford. But people were openly racist in Essex, too, which I rebelled against by getting into hip-hop.</p> <p class="p1">I’d escape by taking a train down to London and going record shopping. But at the same time, I kind of enjoyed living in Essex. There was no danger of being mugged-- I mean, there probably was, but I felt less threatened. And when I got to Essex, I was like, “I’m not going to let anyone fuck with me.” I didn’t get any tougher, though. Well, maybe mentally.</p> <p class="p1">I hated school. Being told what to do always seemed like a weird concept to me. I always feel restricted by authority figures, I can never work it out. Unless your home life is really shitty, who wants to go to school? As I got older, I told my parents, “I don’t see the point of going to school. It’s stupid.” They were like, “Yeah, we agree. Unfortunately, you should probably go. You need to be educated, and we can’t afford to do it any other way."</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p1">"People were openly racist in Essex, <br />which I rebelled against by getting into hip-hop."</p> </blockquote> <p class="p1">I eventually stopped going to school and started smoking weed, which I didn’t really like. But at that time, no one could tell me what to do. When the exams came, I wrote something really stupid and rebellious on the written test, like, “I can’t be bothered.” When the results came out, you had a week to pick them up, but I didn’t bother going. I don’t know what I got, and no one ever asked me. I would tell people that I got a C, though. I could've said I got an A, but I've never been that kind of person.</p> <p class="p1">Around this time, my uncle was producing music at the <a href="http://www.strongroom.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Strongroom</a> in Shoreditch, which is now a famous studio. Soul II Soul did some stuff there. I went there to hang out with my uncle. I saw KRS-One there. This was when I found out you could make beats. My friend Rob was already chopping up beats from the radio and tape and vinyl on his Commodore Amiga, making his own jungle at age 15. I didn’t know how he did it, but I watched him. Then, my uncle gave me a S950 soundboard and an Atari with a cracked version of Cubase. I still have the Atari, and I used the S950 on my new album.</p> <p class="p1">The first show I can remember going to was Aphex Twin and Squarepusher at the Chelmsford YMCA, they were both completely under camouflage in a DJ booth. You couldn’t see them. There were about 50 people there. I got very drunk, so I probably didn’t really care about the music. It was only until later that I found out who they were. And I was like, “Fuck, well I saw Aphex Twin at the Chelmsford YMCA.”</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5-10-15-20_20.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p1"><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/hell-on-earth-4f85eec738226.jpg" alt="" /><b><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4755-mobb-deep/">Mobb Deep</a>: <i>Hell on Earth</i></b></p> <p class="p1"><i></i>I stayed in Essex for a while and then moved around and took some odd jobs. I lived with another guy in a studio room filled with pornos instead of music. We were drinking, smoking, going out-- not doing much. I was making music for fun, too, but I never considered doing anything with it. I made it under some stupid names: Shit Bat, DJ On a Thursday, DJ Punish Your Child Badly.</p> <p class="p1">I worked at a nearby shop called Andy's Records-- a mini-chain, kind of a local version of HMV. The people who owned it were really greedy, and that was their downfall. Then I went to work at HMV, and that was equally as bad. I got fired for calling the manager a cunt.</p> <p class="p1">I worked at a hospital car park where people would shout at me because it was my job to give them a ticket when their dad’s just died and they’ve forgotten to pay off their parking. So instead, I sat in a room eating crisps and watching television. I used to pass my day by putting crisps in a fan and blowing them over the floor, and then vacuuming it all up. My boss found me doing that and was like, “You’re fired.” I worked at Stansted Airport, where I helped people coming back from Spain get on the bus and take them to a car park. They had just gotten off their flight, and they were mental. They’d say to me, “Your mom’s a fucking cunt.” I was actually in tears after one night on the job, so I didn’t bother going back.</p> <p class="p1">I was into hip-hop, but I couldn’t make hip-hop very well and I couldn’t rap, which really got me down. I wanted to be a rapper. You think you're going to bust a rhyme, and then you realize you have nothing to rap about. There’s one hip-hop record that I never get bored of, which is Mobb Deep's <i>Hell on Earth. </i>I don’t think people liked it as much as their first record, but I loved it. It's so bleak and dark. There's nothing happy about it at all.</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5-10-15-20_25.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p1"><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/lichenz.jpg" alt="" /><b><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2610-lichens/">Lichens</a><br /></b><i><small>Photo by Hisham Akira Bharoocha</small></i></p> <p class="p1">I don't know if I should mention this or not, but fuck it. I was sick of life, and I didn’t know what to do. I had a friend who was making techno who was like, “You should do music, you’d be really good at it.” But I wanted to go to Japan and teach English. I thought I’d go there, get a job, make lots of money, and wear a suit, which was enough. But I didn’t have any money, and I didn’t want to work, so I had to find a way of getting to Japan. I found out that I could get a credit card with a <span class="s2">£</span>3,000 limit without any questions, and I could take cash out of this card. They were just giving these cards to anyone, so I had two.</p> <p class="p1">I went to the local library in Tempsford to learn about debts, then I went to the Citizens Advice Bureau and pretended I was in a debt problem. I found out that, legally, the only debts you <i>have</i> to pay off are to the government, and if you don't pay off your cards for six years, the debt is void and you don’t have to pay it back. You get a bad credit rating, but you can start again. It was fraud, but I was like, “Fuck it, it’s not illegal.” All I had to do was wait out the time until the debt disappeared and never reply to a phone call or an email from any debt collectors. I knew how to do it, so I did it, and it worked. So I was in Japan with <span class="s2">£</span>10,000 pounds, which is terrible, really. Morally, it’s awful.</p> <p class="p1">I enjoyed Japan, and when I got back, I wanted to learn Japanese. I was in a worse place though, because I had people chasing me for money and I didn’t want to get a job because I hated all my jobs. I was like, “I’m gonna go to uni and study Japanese." So I found a good course in London. Problem was, it cost <span class="s2">£</span>7,000, which was the exact amount I owed at that time, so I sold all my records on eBay and paid for my course with that.</p> <p class="p1">I got a diploma in Japanese at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, and after a year, I was really good at speaking, reading, and writing the language. I went back to Japan and tried to get a job over there. I wore a suit. I went to banks. I went to marketing companies. I was better than everyone else; the other people's Japanese wasn’t as good as mine. Because I experienced Japanese culture so much, I could hear it so easily. But I never wanted the jobs, because I’d had enough of doing shit jobs. So I went back to England.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p1"><span>"The best thing about working in a sex shop was selling vibrators </span><br /><span>to attractive girls; the worst thing was seeing how many </span><br /><span>men were worried about their penis size."</span></p> </blockquote> <p class="p1">I moved in with my parents again, and then my friend-- the one who was telling me I should do music-- had a stroke and died. That's when I realized that maybe I should do music. So I moved to London, set up my Myspace, and got a job at a sex shop. Then, Wichita Records sent me an email through Myspace and asked if I’d do a Bloc Party remix. Because my uncle was working in music, I asked him, “What do I say?” He said, “Don’t undersell yourself, ask for <span class="s2">£</span>500.” So I did, and they were like, “Yeah, sure. We really like your music.” So I went and met them, had bloody marys at 11 a.m., and was like, “Wow, this is rock'n'roll.” I told them I was working in a sex shop and wanted to quit. They were like, “Well, don’t quit just yet.”</p> <p class="p1">By that point, I’d moved to another branch of the sex shop in Soho, which was more grotty and pervy. Crackheads would come in and try to steal stuff, and the company wasn’t paying for security, so you kind of had to be a security guard as well. I have arms like Ren from "Ren and Stimpy", so I am the least intimidating security guard ever. I worked with other people who were like, “It’s not worth it. You don’t want to be stabbed by a crackhead over a fake latex vagina. That’s not the way you want to go.”</p> <p class="p1">Working there didn’t make me any more interested in sex, though. It was just funny. The best thing was selling vibrators to attractive girls, and the worst thing was seeing how many men were worried about their penis size. Why does anyone care? I just wanted to go up to people and tell them, “Don’t worry, girls don’t really care. Just be a nice guy.” But they'd say, “I’m using the cream every day and I'm not seeing any change.” So I'd say, "You’ve got to use the pump and the cream and take the pills.” You make people feel good about themselves. This old couple came in with a book of all the pornos they owned so they could make sure they weren’t buying the same one again. They were like, “We had so much fun with these, we have our mates around and watch 'em. You wanna come over, love?” I was like, “That's all right.”</p> <p class="p1">The best performance I saw around this time was Lichens at the Explosions in the Sky ATP in 2008. He did a 30-minute improv set. It was during the day, so there weren’t many people watching him because they were smashed from the night before. He rolled out a carpet, sat on a chair, made some bird sounds, and as his guitar got louder, his eyes rolled back into his head like he was possessed. His voice was fucking amazing, unlike anything I’d heard before.</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/5-10-15-20_30.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p1"><img style="float: left;" src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/coltran.jpg" alt="" /><b><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/">John Coltrane</a>: <i>Live in Japan</i></b></p> <p class="p1"><i></i>Suddenly, my exposure to music is massive. I buy everything on vinyl-- one time, I spent $400 on records in Toronto. Lots of jazz, especially, the brilliant stuff where a lot of guys converted to Islam and started doing improvised, spiritual stuff. I've got John Coltrane's <i>Live in Japan</i>, which has a brilliant cover. Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders are on that one, too.</p> <p class="p1">I met my girlfriend Sophia when she didn’t want to book me but was forced to because I was supporting <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/">Caribou</a>. So I moved in with her in Hamburg-- typical musician thing, sponging off a woman. Hamburg was good, but I didn’t feel any real connection with anyone there. I had friends who were in Berlin who were like, “You should come here, it's brilliant for dance music.” So I went there. Now I live in a nice area that I never thought I’d be able to afford to live in. There's a lot of families, the total opposite of what I grew up with in South London. I wanted to live in the posh part of Berlin and see what it was like. I’m really enjoying it-- guiltily.</p>

</p> <p><i><small>From left: Jason Caddell, Travis Morrison, Eric Axelson, Joe Easley. Photo by Shervin Lainez.</small></i></p> <p>At some point in our two-and-a-half hour conversation, Travis Morrison compares listening to an early <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1093-the-dismemberment-plan/">Dismemberment Plan</a> song to being hit with “a confetti cannon of words,” which, coincidentally, is also what it feels like to have a two-and-a-half-hour conversation with Travis Morrison. Before I even get a chance to ask him about <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/50916-the-dismemberment-plan-announce-new-album-uncanney-valley/"><i>Uncanney Valley</i></a>, the reunited Plan’s first new album in over a decade, we’ve ambled down a leisurely path of other pressing topics: animal husbandry, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"><i>Yeezus</i></a>, Noel Gallagher, the gentrification of his (and my) former home of Washington, D.C., and Morrison’s lifelong fear of snapping turtles ("They're basically like zombies. They don't have a mind.") The first pause comes about an hour in, and his publicist, who’s been looking on the whole time as she does work on the other side of the café (“it’s like an Orthodox Jewish date,” Morrison jokes at the beginning of the interview), assumes, very incorrectly, that we must be finishing up. She walks up just as Morrison asks me, with a laugh, “So, I think you have some questions?”</p> <p>The fact that Morrison likes to talk will come as no surprise to anyone who’s ever heard a single Dismemberment Plan song, all of which are anchored by his vivid language and chatty, spitfire delivery. The Plan emerged from D.C.’s punk scene in the mid-90s, but they sounded like nobody else in town (or anywhere else on the planet, for that matter), merging spazzy funk grooves courtesy of one of indie rock’s all-time most inventive rhythm sections (bassist Eric Axelson and drummer Joe Easley), Jason Caddell’s jittery guitar riffs, and Morrison’s anxious, empathic poetry. Their music-- which by my measure includes two legitimate masterpieces, the much-beloved twentysomething survival manual <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14979-emergency-i-vinyl-reissue/"><i>Emergency &amp; I</i></a> and the more mature though equally evocative <i><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2339-change/">Change</a>-- </i>hit a near-impossible bull’s-eye: jammy but with a knack for pop concision, at times jarringly compassionate but never sentimental, sometimes funny but always after something deeper than a punch line.</p> <p>The Dismemberment Plan broke up in 2003 but got back together in 2011, ostensibly to play a few shows celebrating the reissue of <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>. But things went even better than planned. Thanks to a new, internet-savvy generation of listeners who’d belatedly fallen in love with their back catalog, the Plan were playing to the biggest audiences of their career, winning over new fans as they went (including a certain <a href="https://twitter.com/questlove/status/28239572362067969" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">high-profile bandleader</a>), and prompting a frenzy of nostalgia in old ones. (Full disclosure: like most of the other people in the front row, I was compelled to climb onto the stage at one of these shows and scream myself hoarse when the band played fan favorite <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMz7a4XXx84" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“Ice of Boston”</a>.)</p> <p>Morrison says <i>Uncanney Valley</i> wasn’t planned as much as it just happened, but the finished product reflects a newfound confidence, cohesion, and openness in the band. “It’s a step I wish we would have taken a long time ago,” Morrison says. “A lot of it has to do with the songwriting sharpening and getting off of the confetti-cannon approach and being more confident in what I have to say.” Of course, the Dismemberment Plan still sound like nobody else, but this time around they're also aiming for something a little more universal. “With the new record, I find myself dreaming of people actually covering our songs,” he says. “Our old songs weren’t very coverable. They were kind of yoked to us. Which is fine, I mean, you can’t cover a <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/">John Coltrane</a> performance either.” </p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>"There’s a lot of color to the new album. I thought the old <br />stuff could be a little dry, like we were a little afraid of <br />music. We sounded like very worried young men."</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Pitchfork: Did you always want to be a frontman?</b></p> <p>Travis Morrison: I wanted to be a writer when I was a little kid. Then I wanted to be Pete Townshend-- the songwriting guitarist who occasionally sang. The first six months [after forming Dismemberment Plan], I was trying to find another singer. The original idea was that we’d have some pretty boy, and I’d occasionally do the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHTdrPL22-Y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“<i>Feeeel meee, touchhhh meeee</i>.”</a> Then, when we were about 20, [bassist] Eric [Axelson] sat me down and said, “I know you’re not very good at it, but you’re going to have to sing.” [<i>laughs</i>] And look what happened.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Back then, did you ever think you'd still be together 20 years later?</b></p> <p>TM: Yeah. You know, it was a different era. Now, expectations are more muted, but at the time, you would think, “I want to be <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/">Sonic Youth</a>. I want to <i>do it</i>.” You would think of it as a career. So we had dreams about being a fairly long-lived band. When we broke up, I was like, “Oh, we only got to [album] four.”</p> <p>There are bands, like <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/">R.E.M.</a>, who want to have 17 records, and some are terrible and some are great. I don’t know if people think like that anymore. Things are more atomized now. I’m fascinated with the attitude of younger rock bands, even ones that are making money at it. I don’t ever hear them talk about it as a “career.” It almost makes me think there isn’t even a music industry anymore, like an atom bomb fell and it was just eradicated forever. But at certain point, you realize it’s easy to play music for the rest of your life: just don’t sell your guitar. Maybe you get a day job, but as long as you have a guitar, you can play.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: You guys broke up in 2003, went on with your lives, and then reunited for some shows in 2011. Did you know you’d make another album?</b></p> <p>TM: I can’t speak for the other guys, but for me: no expectations. No plans. No vision.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: So how did the record come about?</b></p> <p>TM: I changed my mind. [<i>laughs</i>] As we rehearsed for those shows, we started getting jams. We were always a very collaborative band. People tend to have a perception that I was the songwriter and the music leader, but not really. All our jams were generally like the <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/">Led Zeppelin </a>model: collective creation. So as we rehearsed, improvisational nuggets came out. That really is the lifeline of any band. If a band isn’t coming up with two to four of those when they pick up their instruments, then they have problems-- even if none of them turn into a song. If that’s not happening in a band, it’s time for therapy or breaking up.</p> <p>So those things started happening, and by the time we broke camp after the shows were over, there was a lot of them. It was intense. So we made the decision. But it took some willpower to stay in that [improvised] mode as opposed to, “And now we’re making a record!” It was more like: We’ll keep getting together, make a bunch of weird noises-- not try to write an album, not try to write new songs-- but keep that formlessness going and see what comes out of it. Maybe it’ll dry up. So we did it one month at a time and songs started to come out that we really liked. And then we had a record. [<i>laughs</i>]</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LfT59Bl4MkA" width="620" height="345" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: At what point in the writing process are you working on lyrics?</b></p> <p>TM: I’m weird about that. I don’t have a set working style. Some lyrics come really slow, others come in 10 minutes while I'm watching basketball. They're always a surprise to me.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: So you haven’t developed any kind of writing rituals over time?</b></p> <p>TM: Well, yeah. I like to write early in the morning, like, 5 a.m. If I’m really on my game, I don’t have any coffee or stimulants. I’m kind of in a dream state. I try to be patient. I feel like the point of art is to go down within yourself and to pop up into other people. If you’re lucky, all of a sudden you’re like, “whoop!” You’re in other people.</p> <p>It doesn’t always work, though, so I’m a total ho for any writing workshop, any technique from anyone. I saw an interview with <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/">Jay-Z</a> where he said he didn’t write down any of his lyrics, so I tried that on <i>Change</i>. I’ll do anything. Langston Hughes would write a poem and put it in a drawer and forget about it. And then once a week he would look through the drawer-- it was almost like the poems were written by somebody else. Sometimes [when you’re writing] you get excited and think, “That’s the best!” It’s not. [<i>laughs</i>] So I sometimes try a variance of the drawer trick-- [I write it] and then come back to it and see if it blows. Your ego gets activated real quick, you really want to impress yourself. But when you come back to it, sometimes you’re like, “Yeah, this part? I don’t know. This guy needs a lot of help.”</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>"I saw an interview with Jay-Z where he said he didn’t <br />write down any of his lyrics, so I tried that on <i>Change</i>."</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Pitchfork: Does <i>Uncanney Valley</i> feel like a big departure?</b></p> <p>TM: I’m very proud of it. We did a lot of things we’ve never done before without making a big show of it. We used to be very uptight emotionally. Really, really uptight. I don’t know what our problem was. Well, I do, but... [<i>laughs</i>] Just going through our old stuff, I thought we were extremely clenched, which is OK, but there’s an openness to the new record that is a real achievement for us. I don’t think it’s unrigorous or sloppy, but when I actually listened to it next to our older stuff, I was like, “Whoa!” That was satisfying. There’s a lot of color to it. I thought the old stuff could be a little dry, like we were a little afraid of music. We sounded like very worried young men.</p> <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bMz7a4XXx84" width="620" height="345" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: I made it out to three of the reunion shows, and the energy was insane. It seemed like you were playing for much larger crowds than before. What were those shows like for you?</b></p> <p>TM: It was crazy. I guess [what happened in the past decade] was there’s an infrastructure now for discovering [older music]. It’s really peculiar. The rules are so different now.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: What was the biggest change you noticed?</b></p> <p>TM: When you wrote a song way back in the day, you were writing material to play live. Some of the songs we wrote for shows actually were pretty terrible songs, but they would have a certain impact live. And you would buy the CD at the shows if you like the show. You may not listen to the CD, you might just throw it in the back of your car and let it warp in the sun. The main thing was you saw the song at the show.</p> <p>Now, by and large, people are recording material to put on YouTube. I have a theory that YouTube is, in the end, the #1 media for musicians. Which is strange, because there’s a visual associated with it. Maybe Soundcloud and Spotify are up there, too. But you’re writing music for internet delivery, not shows. I think that affects artists sometimes. Like, there’s a lot of griping and groaning about wanting to play half-baked new songs live, but you don’t want it to just end up on YouTube with like 74 thumbs down: “This is the worst!” But [at the reunion shows] we just did it like we used to, just played our half-baked songs live anyway, and some of them have changed a lot since then. </p> <p>I also feel like bands make much better-sounding and well-put-together records now. There was no indie rock band in the 90s at the level of, like, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/">Grizzly Bear</a>. I listen to their records and it’s crazy how good they sound. That really freaks me out. And it's actually kind of appealing. It’s a challenge. It's like, "Well, you’ve got to get your shit together."</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/dplanz624.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: How do you feel about bands banning cell phones at their shows?</b></p> <p>TM: I’d like to do that, but come on. I’m a grown-ass man. I can’t be, like, ordering people to put down their phones. I saw <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/">Elliott Smith</a> play solo years ago at a bar. It was really loud, and then it started getting louder because all these people started howling like raging freaks to be quiet-- “shut up motherfucker!”-- which made it louder. And Elliott Smith was like, “Yo...” Well, he didn’t say “Yo, baby, it’s cool.” Elliott Smith did not say that. But he was like, “Listen, in a bar, people will buy alcohol and talk loudly and it’d be nice if everyone was quieter, but that’s not how it is. There’s not a whole lot you can do about it.” And everyone was just like [<i>blank stare</i>]. It was the craziest Jedi mind trick I’ve ever seen. Both sides were like, “He’s right,” and then just watched the show.</p> <p>I like to go play shows just to see people, so I’m not in the game of like, “You’re at my show, you’re gonna listen to it like this, blah blah blah.” Then you just end up with a clip on YouTube of you ranting about putting away your phone. I like being a musician that’s also a fly on the wall. I like people coming in the room and doing what they do and then leaving. I like attention, but it actually gives me a little less to work with as a performer if people are editing themselves and not being them.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Do you have any advice for bands just starting out?</b></p> <p>TM: I don’t know. Advice is not really very useful. People gave me terrible advice, and I guess I was just smart enough to ignore some of it. Like, we just did the first Dismemberment Plan release independently, and some of the DC punk rock people were like, “Why are you putting it on cassette, those things won't sell. Just do a 7”.” But we were playing in, like, Virginia, and nobody had a turntable anymore. Everybody’s got a cassette deck in their Ford Focus or whatever, their Ford Escalade. And it was good we didn’t listen to that, even though it came from very smart people who knew exactly what they were talking about. So if I had any advice for young musicians, it would be to use your own ears, your own common fucking sense, and pay attention to what’s going on around you before you listen to douchebags like me.</p>

</p> <p><i><small>Photo by John Kelly</small></i></p> <p class="p1"><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29923-dive/">DIIV</a> frontman Zachary Cole Smith was supposed to be on the phone over an hour ago. By my count, he's blowing me off in four separate ways: Text messages and voicemails have not been returned and there's radio silence from his PR and management. This isn't entirely unexpected. In the past year, Smith has <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/49922-echo-chamber-diiv-fuck-sxsw/">lambasted SXSW's corporate overlords</a>, made a <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/49644-watch-diivs-video-for-wait-starring-sky-ferreira-and-some-topless-women/">grainy, NSFW music video</a> on the heels of a Terry Richardson photoshoot, <a href="http://www.frock-and-roll.com/2013/zachary-cole-smith-of-diiv-x-saint-laurent-paris/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">modeled for Saint Laurent Paris</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/50344-diiv-cancel-shows-i-have-to-be-off-the-road/">hastily canceled a string of European tour dates</a>, and has seemingly been seen around every single indie rock club in New York with a very visible companion in pop starlet <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30673-sky-ferreira/">Sky Ferreira</a>. So if I was looking to support the emerging portrayal of him as a possibly-entitled Kurt Cobain wannabe going through his <a href="http://madamepickwickartblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cobain1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"corporate magazines still suck"</a> phase while living inside NYC's indie rock bubble, he's done me a huge favor.</p> <p class="p1">Alas, it's not quite so simple. I wake up the next morning with an apologetic text from Smith and a request asking if we could set this interview up directly. He's recently been having trouble communicating with some people in his inner circle, mostly because he's planning on firing them. When we finally connect, the self-described "control freak" explains, "When you're an artist-- especially a successful or moderately-successful artist-- there's just a lot of people in the music industry who want a piece of that, and I've become a little bit wise to the kind of stuff to be careful of." Apparently, his rocky experiences following the release of last year's debut album <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16749-oshin/"><span class="s1"><i>Oshin</i></span></a> have taught him a huge lesson: Treat the music industry like a game and you're going to get played.</p> <p class="p1">Whenever an indie rock artist speaks candidly about their financial realities, there's a tendency to blame the victim: "They knew what they were getting into, and seriously, how much money is there to be squeezed out of a band at DIIV's level anyway?" But what emerges from speaking with Smith is that his words and actions aren't out of greed, nor are they an extension of outmoded punk principles about the commodification of art. It's about fairness and making sure some of the money changing hands thanks to his music actually ends up in his own. "Between booking agents, management, and lawyers, I pay-out about 40% of all the money before I even see it," he says. "All these people work on commissions, and they're not in it for the art because they're not artists." And when you consider how thin the profit margins are for a band like DIIV as opposed to an act that might get their own "Behind The Music", you start to realize what's at stake when shaky accounting or a haphazardly-booked tour causes a few thousand dollars to go missing.</p> <p class="p1">So what does this have to do with DIIV's second album? Pretty much everything. Smith repeatedly describes the music on <i>Oshin </i>as<i> </i>"deliberate," and the lyrics as "impersonal." He's written 40-50 new songs this time around, and he claims, "I really want to make a record about the current state of guitar bands. I feel like there really aren't people in indie rock right now, there's just all these faceless bands that live in clichés. They're going through the motions." He promises that the turmoil he's experienced as of late has inspired him to recognize his own part in the problem, too. "In the past, I've been guilty of not really taking my task seriously, too."</p> <p class="p1">When we spoke earlier this month, Smith was back in his "no-frills" apartment after finishing another exhausting run of shows. "It's just a room with a bed in it. There's no kitchen or bathroom. There's a shared bathroom in the hall," he says without any real sense of resignation. Smith doesn't consider himself to be a social person ("I don't really 'hang out' with anybody") and admits to being a "person of routine" who disdains touring on account of it fucking up breakfast ("I have my things I like to eat and my little walk that I like to do in the morning"). His troubles with depression and repression immediately come to the fore; the moment we get started, he speaks for about six consecutive minutes, and this repeats over the next hour. He airs out a year's worth of thoughts about how he's been affected by success, expectations, failed recording sessions with former <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1826-girls/">Girls</a> member Chet "JR" White, shady industry types, and drugs. "The band's given me a lot of cool opportunities, but it's also put me in a lot of situations that I never would've been exposed to before, and put me through a lot of stress and crazy stuff. But I can now put those sentiments into the songs, which I like."</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p2">"Drugs are fine for you alone at home, but when it comes to <br />being a family, which a band is, it just messes everything up."</p> </blockquote> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: Are you planning on getting out on the road again any time soon?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>Zachary Cole Smith: No, fucking thank god. We've been on tour since the band started. I stole some time to work on this record, because it's kind of the only thing I care about. It's this funny thing now: You sign up to be a musician because you want to write music, but you don't spend your time writing music. Instead, you go around the world selling the music you've already made. There's all these people involved, and it becomes this huge machine-- it stops being just me making my own little songs for myself, or for the world. And it's hard to stop the machine. If you want to take time to write a record, they're like, "OK, tour through March, April, and June, then you can take a few weeks off to record in July before getting back on the road for the European festival circuit." After a while, I had to put my foot down.</p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: Was there any specific situation that made you put your foot down?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: No. It's not like I had a breakdown, though it kind of felt like it at the time. I agreed to everything that happened. You can't really be at work and be like, "That's it. I've had too much. I'm going home." I spent my life working before I started this band. I worked construction, landscaping. I worked in kitchens, cleaned dishes. I worked demolition.</p> <p class="p2">Canceling the European tour was more about balance. A record is worth 10,000 live shows. Some kid can say, "Hey, I really want you to play my town in Switzerland, or Sweden, or Latvia," and they could have a fun night at the show. On the other hand, all those kids could have a <i>record</i> that means something to them in a more personal way a couple months down the road. The live band is a really important thing for us, but my focus is on the album now.</p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: Does your touring band have any input in the songwriting?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: The touring band <i>is</i> DIIV, and the songs are always written with them in mind. But the new record is going to be more "me." Even if you take <a href="https://soundcloud.com/capturedtracks/oshin-subsume" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"Oshin (Subsume)"</a>, from the first record, though I play every instrument on that song, I wouldn't say that you can see my DNA all over it. It's meant to be democratic. All the different parts in that song are equally weighted: the bass, drums, vocals, and guitars are all the same exact volume. I've checked if the band wants to be a part of the songwriting, and it seems like they're not really interested. None of them are songwriters. They just prefer to live in New York City, live their regular lives, and maybe work a side job or just live off the band, and then go on tour. I don't think they're really into the creative side of things. </p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: If they're living off DIIV, were they mad when you canceled the tour?</b></p> <p class="p2">ZCS: No. Nobody really wanted to do that one European tour. For one, it was budgeted to lose money. They would've made something, but I would've lost a lot of money.</p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: Why does a tour that's going to lose money get booked to begin with?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: The idea is: You played to 100 people this week in Europe, and then next week you can play to 200. It's an investment in that territory. But it can lose money because it's very expensive to go to Europe. You can't really just say, like, "Oh, we're gonna take our van and drive to California tomorrow." It's more like, "Oh, we have to fly to London and rent three guitar amps, a bass amp, drums; buy all these flights for four people; hire a driver." It's pretty easy to lose money on tour-- most bands do on their first couple of tours. We're more established, but I think it was just poorly booked. It was a mess from the get-go.</p> <p class="p2"><b>Watch DIIV play a new song called "Dust" in their practice space:</b></p> <p class="p2"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mD3cm2nVw6M?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: Can you talk about your experience at SXSW this year? The general backlash to your statements seemed to find hypocrisy in criticizing something you willfully participated in.</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: People were like, "This artist is anti-corporate, he looks like Kurt Cobain, he has long hair. OK, I get it: This is the zeitgeist anti-corporate punk rock." Fucking whatever. That wasn't my intention at all. Our fucking government is owned by corporations, and other companies get money from the government. If you live in Germany, you get money from the government if you're an artist. So since our government <i>is</i> corporations, it makes sense that we should be taking money from corporations to pay for our art.</p> <p class="p2">If I play Coachella, it's sponsored by a company-- that's corporate, too. But we're playing it because we're getting paid and we want to be a part of the festival. At SXSW, there's all this corporate money changing hands, but none of it goes to the artists. It's fucking bullshit. But I didn't want it to be like, "DIIV-- the band that hates SXSW," because that's not my main tenet as an artist. Some people were like, "DIIV is not having fun at SXSW." I was having a <i>blast</i>. All my friends were there. But I lost $8,000. We were participants in it, but kind of blindly. Our booking agent was just like, "These are the shows you're playing in Austin. Here. You're going." So then we bought the flights and went.</p> <p class="p2">At the time, I thought of it as part of a game. I'd been twice before, and it was never that bad. I've always been going as a band that was trying to break; I went with <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27968-beach-fossils/">Beach Fossils</a> and we played 40 shows because we wanted people to see us. And then it got to this year, and, in some ways, we were one of the larger bands playing. We weren't desperate for attention. We were a commodity used by corporations to make their brand look fashionable, but then they used us to keep kids out of venues. We'd play in a 150 capacity room for 20 minutes with no sound check, and all the kids are outside, because they're like, "Sorry, you're not cool enough to go in the fucking Red Bull Vans Fort over here." I participated in it partially because I didn't really think it through before I went, and also because, you know, everybody goes. But when we got there, I realized what a fucked up thing it is. It seems to get worse every year. </p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: What's your advice for a band who's just getting started and wants to use SXSW as a way of getting their name out there?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: If I had my way, SXSW wouldn't happen in 2014. I don't think it deserves to exist.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p2">"At SXSW, there's all this corporate money changing hands, <br />but none of it goes to the artists. It's fucking bullshit. I lost $8,000."</p> </blockquote> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: How did the opportunity arise to model for Saint Laurent Paris?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: [YSL creative director] Hedi [Slimane] is a music-obsessed guy. I might've originally met him through Sky. If you look at his work, he has this prototypical look that he wants. I was at Ariel Pink's show the other day at Webster Hall and [Ariel] commented on my Saint Laurent haircut. It's totally true: Ariel, Christopher Owens, me, and Courtney Love, all in Saint Laurent ads, all with the same haircut. </p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: How is the fashion world different than the music world?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: I grew up around fashion-- my mom was an editor for <i>Vogue</i>. Compared to the music industry, though, I'd say [fashion] is a little bit more disorganized. But it's exciting for me because, when you're a performer, there is a fashion element. Music is much more of a multimedia sort of thing than I expected. It's about your music, but it's also about the cover art, or what you're wearing on stage, or a video that you make.</p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: Do you sometimes think, "This modeling life would be <i>way </i>easier than being on tour 10 months a year"?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: I wouldn't say music is my passion, or my calling, or anything like that. I mean, I don't really believe in that kind of stuff. Life is a series of chance happenings, so I just fell into it. But music is an opportunity to say every single thing that you want to say. People will pore over whatever you say and however you say it and, for me, it represents complete freedom of speech. You can't show somebody what it's like to experience loss, but you can soundtrack it and help them experience their own loss. I am so lucky to have this venue to be able to say and talk about all the stuff I've been through. </p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: DIIV was originally named after a Nirvana song, and there's always been a visual similarity between yourself and Kurt Cobain. How has your relationship with his music changed since DIIV started taking off?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: He was a spirit guide in the beginning. I knew what all the fame would feel like already because I read about it in his journals. And I saw the angry letters that he would write to Lynn [Hirschberg], who wrote a shitty article [in <i>Vanity Fair</i>] about Courtney Love-- there's a copy of the fax he hand-wrote to her saying that he's going to kill her. So I had a sense of what it was like to be a couple who has exposure. But again: Kurt is completely different.</p> <p class="p2">To be told that you're the voice of your generation is such an incredible amount of pressure, and I haven't faced that. Maybe by the time our third record rolls around, I will. My goals are to be a band like that in five years. At the moment, though, I can't really relate in any sense to the scale that his fame has reached. But I've already had a hard time dealing with some of the trappings of success and turned to some pretty stereotypical escape routes-- ways of escaping my own reality and falling into some pretty clichéd situations. </p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: Are drugs a problem?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: Yeah, they're a huge problem. [<i>laughs</i>] Definitely on tour, at least. We had one tour particularly where it was really bad, and a bunch of us-- not everybody-- were all just lying to each other. There's a lot of deception and bad blood. Drugs are fine for you alone at home, but when it comes to being a family, which a band is, it just messes everything up.</p> <p class="p2"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/diiv624.jpg" alt="" /><i><small>Photos by Pooneh Ghana</small></i> </p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: After the reviews for <i>Oshin </i>came out last year, you posted the lyrics and claimed not enough critics paid attention to them. Do you feel like you weren't being taken seriously?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: The lyrics from the first record are kind of secondary; it wasn't a record where I wanted to draw much attention to the lyrics. On this new record, though, the lyrics are the centerpiece. If you're a brand new band making your first record, it's just easier to get people to listen if you have simple pop songs. It's way less controversial. We paid our dues on that first record, and people are going to be way more patient listening to what I have to say now. I don't have five seconds to get their attention, I have five <i>minutes</i>. That's a huge window. </p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p2">"There's so much nostalgia in rock music. The Rolling Stones <br />are on the cover of <i>Rolling Stone</i>. How fucking cheesy is that?"</p> </blockquote> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: You recently did a recording session with former Girls member JR White in San Francisco. How'd that come about? </b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: He's a friend. But in some ways, I was totally misguided. I had these glorified ideas about San Francisco and its drug culture-- I thought inspiration would just hit me and I would get these San Francisco drugs in my system and all of a sudden an amazing record would come out. But that's not really what happened at all. We sat down in a studio and, instead of picking up a guitar and having some beautiful thing come out, I just had no idea what the fuck I was doing there and gave up before I even started. Anything that we recorded was a great learning experience, and it was really cool to work with JR. I consider him to be a musical big brother. But that particular session was completely misguided. I was desperate and I went out there for the wrong reasons.</p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: So JR won't be involved with the second record?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: I want to produce the record myself. We've had every modern-day producer flying at me like, "Oh, this guy produced <i>this</i> band," and it's some fucking band that I read about on Pitchfork two years ago. It's cool to get attention but, in the end, I'm a control freak and I have a very clear vision. I'm the only person who I can trust to produce this record.</p> <p class="p2"><b>Watch DIIV play an untitled new song at a recent show:</b></p> <p class="p2"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RmYBAv3rBEw?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: Who are you looking towards for songwriting inspiration?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>ZCS: There's a huge influence that I really wanna establish on the record: <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/">Elliott Smith</a>. On the first record, we kind of eschewed pop structure-- it was much more influenced by German psychedelic bands like Kluster, La Düsseldorf, Neu!, or Can. But listening to Elliott has brought me into pop structure-- verses and choruses and pre-choruses-- stuff that I never really found interesting before. Also, I'm inspired by <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17243-accelerator/">Royal Trux's <i>Accelerator</i></a> and their self-titled record-- there's something so chaotic about it.</p> <p class="p2">But generally, I think people are just going through the motions now. There's so much stuff that people are doing today that has already been done. I kind of like that new Savages record, but I don't know why they take themselves so seriously. There's this manifesto, it's pure throwback. I'm not interested in that. There's so much nostalgia in rock music. The Rolling Stones are on the cover of <i>Rolling Stone</i>. How fucking cheesy is that? </p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Now that you're trying to put more of your personality into your songwriting, are you worried about people getting to know the "real" you?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>ZCS: I don't know if there's anything that would surprise people, because I don't think that anybody knows anything about me at all. There's not much out there. I think I'm going to come out with a pretty dark and troubled record, and it might upset some people. There's a lot of stuff that I've been through in my life in the past couple of months that I don't really want to share with people who are close to me, but I have no option if it's my art. </p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Has your relationship with Sky helped you sort through these things?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>ZCS: She's definitely been there for me through a lot of fucked up personal shit. But also in terms of being a kind of popular artist figure and knowing how isolating that is, and knowing what it feels like to be skeptical of people, and to be taken advantage of, especially by your friends. That's a hard to pill to swallow, and we've been through that together, or watched each other go through it. It helps to have somebody that close to you who can relate. I can say with some confidence that I feel like Sky saved my life.</p>

</p> <p><i><small>The Pastels: Stephen McRobbie and Katrina Mitchell. Photos by Blair Young.</small></i></p> <p>
The Pastels: &quot;Check My Heart&quot; <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/theinsound/the-pastels-check-my-heat"> on SoundCloud</a>. </p> <p>In the bookish, sugar-sweet corner of punk-inspired guitar music that we call indie pop-- a scrappy subculture where amateurism is heralded, charm goes a long way, and crushworthy hooks go miles further-- <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3263-the-pastels/">the Pastels</a> are legends. But time has shown that icon status does not necessarily guarantee the ability to endure through new records, nor the power to gracefully evolve. With three decades behind them, the Pastels have done both, developing slowly from early pop rippers (1989's <i>Sittin' Pretty</i> is essential) to more subdued sophistication on <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18056-the-pastels-slow-summits/"><i>Slow Summits</i></a>-- a work-in-progess since 2007 that was finally released last month on <a href="http://www.dominorecordco.us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Domino</a>. It's their first album since 1997's <i>Illumination</i>, and one of their best, a dimlit collage of strings and flutes featuring moments of poptimism and jazzy textures inspired by <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/">Arthur Russell</a>'s 1970s <i>Instrumentals</i> series. Still,<i> </i><i>Slow Summits</i> doesn't totally forsake a character of off-kilter abandon as much as it's just the latest progression in Pastelism.</p> <p>When I dial Stephen McRobbie (aka Stephen Pastel) to discuss the record, it's 10 p.m. Glasgow time on a Friday night (at his request). He'd been out with his friend Norman Blake, of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4181-teenage-fanclub/">Teenage Fanclub</a>. The day before he took part in a weekly ritual: "I always play table tennis on Thursday," McRobbie notes casually. At first, the activity strikes me as comical, opening the door to a host of cardigan-clad jokes about twee culture. But the idea of McRobbie and his bandmates Katrina Mitchell (his co-songwriter and partner) and Gerard Love (also of Teenage Fanclub) gathering at a day center to unwind is telling-- our conversation often hits on McRobbie's socialism and how that factors into the group's community-focused convictions. "We just kind of turn up and play," he says. "You should try it."</p> <p>In the time since <i>Illumination</i>, the Pastels have also worked on commissioned theater music, a film soundtrack (2002's <i>The Last Great Wilderness</i>) and a collaborative LP with Japanese act Tenniscoats (2009's <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13463-two-sunsets/"><i>Two Sunsets</i></a>), the latter two released via Stephen and Katrina's own <a href="https://twitter.com/geographicmusic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Geographic</a> label. (They're now planning a series of reissues from Strawberry Switchblade, the undersung Scottish bubblegum-pop duo.) Since 2002, McRobbie has also co-owned a Glasgow record shop called <a href="http://www.monorailmusic.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Monorail</a> with a couple of friends, where he typically works three or four days a week. "It was one of those times when you're quietly confident about something and quite pleased when it works out," he says, talking about the store, though the statment holds true for many of his musical ventures.</p> <p>It would seem that a new generation has recently discovered the Pastels-- downloading their albums from blogs, Tumbling zine articles, reveling in 90s inter-band trivia. (I'll never forget the stunned feeling of learning, a few years ago, that <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/380-black-tambourine/">Black Tambourine</a>'s 1992 track "Throw Aggi Off the Bridge" was a reference to Pastels' Annabell Wright.) In spirit, though, their audience never went anywhere at all.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>"What makes us different is what makes us strong."</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Pitchfork: Do you still feel like you’re an outsider by nature?</b></p> <p>Stephen McRobbie: When we started in Glasgow, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/">Orange Juice</a> was really exciting. They moved to London and never really put their roots down in this city, but people who loved them did. We were part of that, but we were outside of prevailing trends within the city, too. A sense of community is a really important part of the Pastels, but it's good <i>not</i> to feel that anyone within the community could make the music that you could. We always feel slightly outside of things-- we don’t rehearse where all the other groups rehearse. We try to keep it apart, even though I feel so much love for the city and the music that comes from it. But I want to be a distinct voice within that. What makes us different is what makes us strong.</p> <p>We've made records for much longer than I could have ever imagined when we started. I thought we existed in some place after punk, that we could find something distinctive and make records for three or four years. I look at groups like <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/">Yo La Tengo</a> and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/">the Fall</a>, and I think, "Maybe this is a good generation of groups that could keep going." We're these voices that are trying to be strong and say something new. That's what the group is: being truthful, but also trying to imagine something up ahead.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: There's a generation of young fans excited about your music, too.</b></p> <p>SM: Music really can burn out. It’s very specific to periods. But there’s a tendency to wonder what came before. Society’s changing, music’s changing. The way we listen to music is becoming something that none of us quite understand. When I listen to <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/">Animal Collective</a>, sometimes I would think, "Ah, things are becoming so complicated now." It’s almost too much for me to listen to. Something like the new <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/">My Bloody Valentine</a> record is just as complicated, but somehow I can understand the sounds or voices. Trying to engage with the different ways that older things and newer things come across... it’s such an interesting time.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: What sort of influence would you want the Pastels to have on younger indie pop bands that look up to the group?</b></p> <p>SM: I would like the work to inspire people in terms of how it was often the best thing that we could do in the moment. As a group, we loved other music and never felt sealed. We embraced our own flaws and tried to make something spectacular but very human.</p> <p>In the 1980s, the music we were making was odd. We should have been making synth music. The idea of guitars was all over, but we ended up in a group with people that enjoyed guitars. I like the idea of people not being afraid of failure, just documenting what you are as a group, but also trying to find the good elements and glamorizing those, to an extent. </p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>"Sometimes I wonder: Maybe money would be better spent on a kidney dialysis machine rather than in supporting artists."</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Pitchfork: I read an interview you recently posted on Facebook about the "anti-twee" sentiment. It reminded me of how, for an indie pop band, the Pastels always felt subversive or punk to me.</b></p> <p>SM: Being subversive is not a natural state for me. But I always feel horrified at certain things. For instance, we’re all in our 30s and 40s, so we’re all connected to each other’s families. We have that strong sense of community, and I like the idea of people doing well in a kind of equal society. As a socialist, I’m always into that. So I feel angry at people calling a lot of these ideas we have twee because I can’t think of anything less twee.</p> <p>Tonight, I was out with Norman from Teenage Fanclub, one of my good friends. We were talking about this music award in Scotland, which we both basically support. Generally speaking, it's a good thing, and the people who run it have gotten funding for it. But it creates certain contradictions. Should there be a prize for coming "first" in music? Or is it more democratic and personal? Scotland’s a very small country, and I very much support some arts funding, but I sometimes just wonder: Maybe that money would be better spent on a kidney dialysis machine rather than in supporting artists.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: A monetary reward for music could project an idea of it being about an end to something, not a means.</b></p> <p>SM: There's not always a prize. Where’s the prize for all the early <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5449-the-modern-lovers/">Modern Lovers</a> recordings that set the blueprint for so many years of music, you know? In a way, once you start giving out prizes, where do you stop?</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: You’ve spoken before about how you never wanted the Pastels to be what you earned your living from.</b></p> <p>SM: Yeah. It’s not something I feel super moral about-- we have our new record, and I'm starting to think it would probably be good for me to give more time to this, because if we play shows we can generate money. Art in our society is really integral, but it's not integral in the way of people staying alive. Well, I think music's really one of the most important things, but a lot of the best music finds its own way to be made. </p> <p>A lot of great records were made by people who had decadent lifestyles and sat around for ages, and then, in the last moment, went into the studio and did something really good. But I also see people who work hard and think it would be great if they had a bit more time to spend with their music. Other times, I see people who would be better off having <i>less</i> time to spend with their music. It’s a constant dilemma. As a socialist, I want to create a situation where brilliant art can arise, but brilliant art often arises out of terrible situations. You don’t want things to be terrible, but in the UK a lot of the best music was made in the Thatcherist era, which was horrible. It’s not simple, but the outsider voice is always really interesting-- something oppositional that isn’t immediately embraced by the prevalent body.</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/The-Pastels-by-Blair-Young-1624.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: At this point, is it important to you to create a sound that is new or different from what you have done in the past? Or is it more about having parameters and writing the best songs you can within them?</b></p> <p>SM: We don’t feel like we have parameters. We always feel new when we do something, and it always seems to connect in some way with what we’ve done before. But there’s always a freshness for us when we play together. It never feels like we’re trying to play a new version of “Nothing to Be Done” or “Crawl Babies”. We have a certain group sound but we’re always trying to expand the parameters of that sound.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: I was recently listening to an early Pastels interview where you spoke about rejecting the idea of sophistication. But the new material has horns, cellos, and other strings, which are very sophisticated. How do you see that concept of sophistication factoring in nowadays?</b></p> <p>SM: In the 80s, we were very suspicious, but everyone that plays in the Pastels is always very ambitious. I love pop music with string arrangements, like <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/22319-the-left-banke/">the Left Banke</a> and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/">the Beatles</a> and all the 60s things. But also, I like a particular sound that’s arrived at-- I don’t like bringing in people who can just do that for music instantly. It’s been a process for us. I’m really proud of a lot of those early records, they were very ambitious. In terms of how we sounded when we were in the rehearsal room, they were really fabulous creations, and I don’t know how we managed to make them in some instances. Now, sometimes we sound really good in the rehearsal room, but we’re still trying to do something more. I don’t know what the epitome of sound is, but it’s something we’re always reaching for.</p> <p> <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="300" height="24" id="player-7605" name="player1"> <param name="movie" value="http://cdn.pitchfork.com/streaming-player/player.swf"> <param name="allowfullscreen" value="false"> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"> <param name="flashvars" value="file=&title=&quot;Illuminum Song&quot;&lightcolor=EF4135&streamer=rtmp://s3w1mu85xbnhjc.cloudfront.net/cfx/st"> <embed id="player-7605" name="player-7605" src="http://cdn.pitchfork.com/streaming-player/player.swf" width="300" height="24" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="false" flashvars="file=&title=&quot;Illuminum Song&quot;&lightcolor=EF4135&streamer=rtmp://s3w1mu85xbnhjc.cloudfront.net/cfx/st" />

</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Something that stuck out for me with <i>Slow Summits </i>was the potential influence of Arthur Russell's 1975 <i>Instrumentals </i>series.</b></p> <p>SM: I'm excited that you said that. Arthur Russell is one of my heroes. I came across him about eight years ago. I thought he was a disco pioneer and then was really freaked out when I heard all this other stuff. I love the sound of him playing in a room-- the negotiated sounds of a room. When we were making our record, we'd come to the end of the song in the rehearsal room, and there'd be quite a nice chord turnaround. Suddenly, we'd just keep playing, and people in the band would feel like they could express themselves. A lot of that music was absolutely the best stuff we were doing-- the rolling outros-- and that was the music I was really passionate about. I tried to make those into the main parts of the songs.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: A song like "Summer Rain" definitely has the <i>Instrumentals </i>feel.</b></p> <p>SM: "Summer Rain" was my favorite song that I carried around for two or three years. You carry a song like it's your main hope-- not like it's the most important piece of music you'll ever make, but the most important music you think about in your life. I had this idea for a song that would be quite melodic and simple, with a really short, Kinks-style outro, that would just die off after 20 seconds, but [multi-instrumentalist] Tom [Crossley] had all these flute ideas. Then it became like a lot of the music we love-- like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralf_und_Florian" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Ralf und Florian</i></a> album, or Arthur Russell's <i>Instrumentals</i>.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>"I don’t know what the epitome of sound is, <br />but it’s something we’re always reaching for."</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Pitchfork: You played the 20th anniversary show for the influential zine <a href="http://chickfactor.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>chickfactor</i></a> last year, why do you think that publication and scene has endured?</b></p> <p>SM: There was a really nice aesthetic that [<i>chickfactor</i> co-founders] Gail [O'Hara] and Pam [Berry] were able to bring to <i>chickfactor</i>. It was very subtle and emphasized groups where females were the leader, or doing something key within the group, but it was an understated polemic. They just noticed things with longevity. They were right on things very early, when people weren't so interested. Things have longevity when they are personal and intense.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: The Pastels also had the <i>Pastelism</i> zine. </b><b>Nowadays, do you feel content to communicate with people online, through Facebook and Twitter, or did you place more value on things you used to do in print?</b></p> <p>SM: I don’t place more value in print, but sometimes if I see a beautiful book I think it's best to step back from the screen. You have a sense of something having real worth. There are fantastic blogs and great writing on the internet, and the speed of communication is exciting. But also I love something beautiful. I love records and fanzines and books and great photos that I can see the print of. That’s not about to die. It’s important for everyone.</p> <p><b> Pitchfork: Would you ever reproduce the Pastels zine, or do you think it had its time and place?</b></p> <p>SM: It had its time and place, but we’ve been speaking to a publisher about the idea of doing some sort of Pastels book that would be a mixture of works we’ve produced and photographs and writing, too.</p> <p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/64808196?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ababab" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: In the recent video for "Check My Heart" there are a lot of children. It made me wonder, are you and Katrina married and do you have kids?</b></p> <p>SM: We’re not married. But I can’t imagine being with anyone else. I imagine we will get married at some point. Allison, who plays trumpet, is Katrina’s little sister; she’s got two little children. Aggi and Tom have got a girl. And John, who plays guitar, has a girl called Astrid. It’s kind of a family, but Katrina and I don’t have any children.</p> <p>A central part of the video is the idea that music’s such a big part of our lives, but our lives are changing because our friends are parents. We tried to make something that’s a cool pop video, but also an accurate summation of where we are now. We’re still in love with the pop moment-- with the idea that you can make a record you can dance to-- but we also love just being around our friends’ children and everything.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>"Things have longevity when they are personal and intense."</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Pitchfork: Sixteen years passed between the last Pastels record and <i>Slow Summits</i>. What differences in your life stand out, other than being older?</b></p> <p>SM: I can certainly say that our lives have changed dramatically. We try to not glamorize every moment, but to also make something that’s hopeful, that’s got a belief in humanity, that’s really quietly triumphant. The main thing that happened in my life is that my dad died. It’s already marked a song like “Night Time Made Us”. During the latter part of making the record, the sessions became tighter, because we felt that we had less available time. In a way, I think life’s one thing, and what you do is something different. I don’t always go to a film and expect to experience everything the director has experienced during the time he was making it. But you also want a sense of truth. And I do have a sense that our record is truthful.</p>

People are <br />working their asses off to make the best shit, and <br />Kanye's leading the pack." -- Justin Vernon</p> </blockquote> <p><b>GETTING THE CALL</b></p> <p class="p1"><b>Justin Vernon:</b> After <i>Twisted Fantasy</i>, I kind of assumed that I'd get the call again at some point. I get along with Kanye really well and I think his musical decisions are exquisite. He feels otherworldly-- he talks about being a god and shit, and his confidence in himself is inspiring. But at the end of the day, he's a musician working in the lab. We have fun. So when the call came for this album, I was like, "Shit yeah!"</p> <p class="p1"><b></b><b>Noah Goldstein:</b> When I was 17, I saw Dr. Dre's episode of "Behind the Music", and he was sitting at the console, looking through the glass. I was like, “That’s the dude I want to be!” Then, a few years later, I was working on hip-hop mixtapes at this studio in West Philadelphia, and it was a terrible situation, a really bad neighborhood. I almost got in numerous altercations there. So I quit there after a year and a half, and said, "The only way I’m ever working in hip-hop again is if I work for Jay-Z and Kanye West.” It was super tongue-in-cheek. Then, almost exactly 10 years later, Kanye hired me to work on <i>Dark Fantasy</i>. And four months after that, we were working on <i>Watch the Throne</i> with Jay.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Travi$ Scott:</b> My manager Anthony Kilhoffer has been Kanye's engineer/producer from the beginning, and he showed him my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vld3uWewvyI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"Lights (Love Sick)"</a> video during the <i>Cruel Summer</i> sessions. I was pretty much homeless when Kanye first flew me to New York. Later on, I was in Miami with 'Ye and Will Smith-- I was playing Will my album, he fucks with it. He's like my homey now. Then 'Ye's like, "You gotta come to Paris." I got a passport and went. It was just me, 'Ye, and Noah Goldstein at first. We weren't even doing actual studio shit. We were just chilling, running around A.P.C.'s offices, making music on my laptop.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Evian Christ:</b> When Kanye's camp was working on <i>Cruel Summer</i>, they were apparently listening to my mixtape <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13083-kings-and-them/"><i>Kings and Them</i></a> a lot. So when they decided to come out with this industrial, electronic, dark vision for <i>Yeezus</i>, they hit me up. In January, they told us, “Kanye’s in the studio on Sunday, it’d be good if we could have some stuff to play him.” That was on the Friday before, so I had two days to make some tracks that were specifically tailored to Kanye West. I don’t think I went to bed that night. I just made track after track after track-- nine altogether-- and sent them over. A couple of days later, they were like, “This is great, we’ve started working on one.” That track eventually became "I'm in It".</p> <p><i><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/bearz.jpg" alt="" /></i><i><small>Image by <a href="http://iamleighton.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leighton McDonald</a></small></i></p> <p class="p1"><b>"I'M IN IT"</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b><b>Anthony Kilhoffer:</b> "I'm in It" started out with a different sample and melody. Then Kanye removed the sample, and it lived as a six-minute arrangement for a while. Then <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6945-rick-rubin/">Rick Rubin</a> got ahold of it and structured it to flow as a three-minute piece. Oftentimes, songs start out at six minutes, then they get whittled down to the best parts over the course of months.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Mike Dean:</b> We're all trying to push things to be weirder. I sometimes push for stuff to be more musical, and then Kanye pulls it back to hip-hop. "I'm In It", for instance, had these crazy guitar parts and all this stadium stuff, and then Rick, Noah, and Kanye pulled it back. I wasn't very happy with that at first, but it came out really well.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Evian Christ:</b> That track is obviously very overtly sexual, and the production mirrors that. When I first sent it, I had some breathy sex sounds laid on the snares, and by the time Kanye was rapping over it, it definitely went into overdrive as far as emphasizing the sexuality. The first time I heard it with Kanye's vocals, I had to do a double-take on a couple of the lines. But if you’re gonna do a song like that, you may as well go all the way; if you’re gonna do a sex song, you may as well talk about fisting. To me, it was very <i>definite</i>-- he absolutely knew what he wanted to do on that track.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p1">"Kanye's talking about a bunch of really stunningly visual sex shit <br />on 'I'm in It', but it's not like he's saying stuff like that to <br />his friends 24 hours a day." -- Justin Vernon</p> </blockquote> <p class="p1"><b>Mike Dean:</b> Justin Vernon is one of the collaborators Kanye will always go to. He doesn't fit in with any genres-- you never know if he's gonna sing like the Bee Gees or some crazy distorted thing. And you don't know what he's saying half the time. He's kind of like <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28264-michael-mcdonald/">Michael McDonald</a>, like he's got marbles in his mouth. It's about the emotion.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Justin Vernon:</b> I don't even know what I'm singing on "I'm in It"-- I'd have to look at it. Kanye's talking about a bunch of really violently and stunningly visual sex shit in there, but it's not like he's saying stuff like that to his friends 24 hours a day. I mean, sitting around the studio, we all have intelligent conversations about the state of women in the world-- I wouldn't say we had a conversation about feminism, necessarily, but we're sensitive to it.</p> <p class="p1">The imagery of the song is definitely intense, but so is <i>American Psycho</i>. I loved <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/51122-watch-kanye-wests-american-psycho-themed-tk-video-starring-scott-disick-and-jonathan-cheban/">that little <i>American Psycho</i> clip he did</a>-- it puts things into context, because Kanye feels like a director, and I don't think everything he's saying in the songs is actually <i>him</i> saying it every time. It's like a movie, or a concept. On "I'm in It", it seems like I'm playing a character in the song, but I'm not necessarily guiding who that character is-- Kanye's editing creates the character. I definitely remember the "star fucker" section in the middle, though, just calling somebody out.

A lot of the record is trying to avoid obviousness. Through the entire process of putting it together, there were tons of easy slam dunks, but rather than just going for the hits and having an album that nobody's going to give a fuck about in a month or two, he intentionally sidestepped the obvious route each time.

Still, we would explore all kinds of options: different tempos or drums, whether a song should be synth-based on real-instrument based. A lot of younger producers just get a beat, put a rap on it, and that’s the song. There's no dissecting, or recreating, or considering the relevance in contemporary music.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Noah Goldstein:</b> Part of my job is to be up on pop culture, but also keep track of what's going on in the depths of the music scene.

It takes him out of the realm of so many other mainstream rap artists who only focus on the bragging side of things; you don't necessarily feel like you have any personal connection with a lot of those artists, whereas Kanye puts so much of his own personality into his music.</p> <p class="p2"><i><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/blacksi624.jpg" alt="" /></i><i><small>Image by <a href="http://patheticpixels.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pathetic Pixels</a></small></i></p> <p class="p2"><b>"BLOOD ON THE LEAVES"</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b><b>Travi$ Scott:</b> "Blood on the Leaves" is a crazy-ass song, bro.

So about a month after we made it, in the summer of 2011, they first got in touch with me. And while that entire original beat is still there on "Blood on the Leaves", the finished version-- with the Nina Simone part and everything-- is completely different. It's really become a fucking proper song. I think Kanye had wanted to use that "Strange Fruit" sample for a while, but it was like, "How in the hell are you going to get that to fit?" But it miraculously came together. Obviously, "Strange Fruit" carries so much political weight, and "Blood on the Leaves" is more about past relationships, but you can draw some parallels between the two.

So I spent a week in intensive care in the middle of making the record, next to people who were literally on their deathbeds.

</p> <p class="p1"><i><a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/overtones/">Overtones</a> is a column by <a href="http://pitchfork.com/staff/jayson-greene/">Jayson Greene</a> that examines how certain sounds-- a snare crack, a synth blob, a ghostly string sample-- linger in our minds and lives.</i></p> <hr /> <p class="p1">"On Sight", the first song on <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/">Kanye West</a>'s <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"><i>Yeezus</i></a>, is a vengefully ugly piece of music. The snarling pile of synths that jump-start the song are so corroded that it's difficult to discern where the beat is, or if Kanye's voice falls on it. It is the most bracingly amusical moment of the rapper’s career-- it hits like a blast from a riot hose. But then, a minute and sixteen seconds in, something even more interesting happens: a soul sample crashes in.</p> <p class="p1">Well, it isn't a soul song, strictly speaking. It's a soulful gospel number, called <a href="http://www.whosampled.com/sample/view/212560/Kanye%20West-On%20Sight_Holy%20Name%20of%20Mary%20Choral%20Family-Sermon%20(He'll%20Give%20Us%20What%20We%20Really%20Need)/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"(Sermon) He’ll Give Us What We Really Need"</a>, recorded by the South Side Chicago choir the Holy Name of Mary Choral Family. And it isn't technically a sample, either-- according to <i>Yeezus</i> lore, it's a painstaking studio recreation of the original, commissioned by panicked label executives as a backup plan while Kanye reportedly spent the dwindling hours before the album's release tracking down the choir director for permission instead of finishing the record.</p> <p class="p1">But these details don't change the impact of the hymn: in the suggestion of popping vinyl, wobbly pitch center, and faded-world poignance, there is no mistaking how Kanye wants it to perceived: It is a Soul Sample on a Kanye West Record, no matter how it got there. Of all the rich discussion fodder West dumped in our laps this week with the proudly unfinished-sounding <i>Yeezus</i>, I found myself increasingly drawn to these little moments where he gestured, however faintly, towards his earlier self. They felt like dropped clues.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p1">There's something taunting and mean about the soul samples on Yeezus; they are like nightmare versions of West’s earliest work.</p> </blockquote> <p class="p1">Few rappers or producers this millennium, after all, have a more intimate relationship with soul music than Kanye West. And on a record about forcibly severing all ties, the one tangled thread Kanye can't bring himself to cut completely is this one, linking him to the most universally beloved black music of the last 50 years. But the relationship has changed, or curdled: The voices rip through like unwelcome memories, dropping rudely into the evil din and then cutting right back out again, like a needle knocked off a turntable. The snippet of "What We Really Need" on "On Sight" plays uninterrupted, like tears streaming down a face, for 13 seconds, before it is snuffed out. West echoed this gesture in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/arts/music/kanye-west-talks-about-his-career-and-album-yeezus.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">his recent <i>New York Times</i> Q&amp;A with Jon Caramanica</a>, summoning his beloved early soul-rap beats and dismissing them in the same breath: "<a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/">Jay-Z</a> was an amazing communicator that made the soul sound extremely popular," he said. "And because I could make the soul sound in my sleep, it finally gave me a platform."</p> <p class="p1">It was Caramanica, in that interview, who first called <i>Yeezus</i> "the anti-<i>College Dropout</i>." Back in those early days, when West was sporting the "pink Polo and a <i>fucking</i> backpack," he <a href="http://www.whosampled.com/sample/view/326/Talib%20Kweli-Get%20By_Nina%20Simone-Sinnerman/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sampled Nina Simone for "Get By"</a>, a song about desperation that used Simone's music as a ray of hope and determination. On <i>Yeezus</i>, Simone is once again sampled. A loop of her voice from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Fruit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"Strange Fruit"</a> is the Angel of Death on "Blood on the Leaves", balefully cataloging the "black bodies swinging in the summer breeze." There is no hope here, only horrors. There's something taunting, and mean, about these moments; they are like nightmare versions of West’s earliest work.</p> <p class="p1">Hip-hop and soul music have always maintained a volatile, uneasy symbiosis. In his 2010 memoir <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Decoded-Jay-Z/dp/0812981154" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Decoded</i></a>, Jay-Z wrote about the potent mix of emotions soul music inspired in him. “The music from that era was incredible, full of emotion," he writes. "[It] was beautiful in part because it was keeping a kind of torch lit in a dark time. I feel like we-- rappers, DJs, producers-- were able to smuggle some of the magic of that dying civilization out in our music and use it to build a new world. We were kids without fathers, so we found our fathers on wax and on the streets and in history, and in a way, that was a gift: We got to pick and choose the ancestors who would inspire the world we were going to make for ourselves."</p> <p class="p1">The generations of rappers who fell in love with that grand, burnished soul sound loved it, in part, for the vanished world of their parents it represented. Soul music could be lots of things-- anguished, driven, consumed by lust or spiritual torment-- but even at its darkest, it was always lit with at least a faint ray hope. Rap is not hopeful music; it is music predicated on the understanding that determination can be hope's viable substitute.</p> <p class="p1">The dance between hip-hop and soul has always been on either side of this lens, and rappers who tapped into it found ways to tag it, make it their own. When <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/">Ghostface Killah</a> screams about beat-downs and the squalor of his early-80s childhood, for example, <a href="http://www.whosampled.com/sample/view/4150/Ghostface%20Killah-Holla_The%20Delfonics-La-La%20Means%20I%20Love%20You/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">over the Delfonics’ sunlit hymn of pure devotion “La-La Means I Love You" on "Holla"</a>, he makes a devastating point-- about worlds gone, about cherished memories clutched to through dark times, about not-quite-extinguished hopes, and how the glowing embers they become so often take the form of cherished old songs. The juxtaposition is so rich with poetic contrasts that it opens up little seams. It's like getting three songs for the price of one: Ghostface’s finely-observed street story, the amber-hued soul classic playing the background, and then the shadow song that opens in up in the tragic gulf between the Delfonics' "you are the one for me" and Ghostface pointing guns at your head.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p1">Within Yeezus' sonic landscape, the hopeful music of previous <br />eras is more like gall rising in the throat than anything else.</p> </blockquote> <p class="p1">You can hear a lot of this painful relationship with soul music on <i>Yeezus</i>: The samples are fleeting, improperly EQ'd, sort of unreal-sounding, and often mocking. They seem to evoke previous eras more as a taunt than a balm. West perverts lots of civil rights imagery in his lyrics, too: "I put my fist in her like a civil rights sign" is the most viscerally sickening thing he's ever said. On the same song, he turns "free at last" into "show me your tits." The jaundice on the record sounds like the 70s, or at least a version of that decade that lives on in our cultural memory-- burnt up tenements, curdled dreams. In this landscape, the hopeful music of previous eras is more like gall rising in the throat than anything else.</p> <p class="p1">There is one relatively undefiled soul sample on <i>Yeezus</i>, and it comes with closer "Bound 2". The sample is by the <a href="http://www.whosampled.com/sample/view/211335/Kanye%20West-Bound%202_Ponderosa%20Twins%20Plus%20One-Bound/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ponderosa Twins Plus One</a>, a Cleveland group made up of two groups of identical twins and a school friend of theirs named Ricky Spicer. "Bound" was part of a two-sided single put out by Sylvia Robinson on All Platinum Records, the imprint that would eventually be reborn-- after Fed investigations, bankruptcy, and a fateful visit to the Harlem World nightclub, where Lovebug Starski was performing-- as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Hill_Records_(rap)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sugar Hill Records</a>, hip-hop's first hit label. This is a tiny piece of the genre's sacred text, a background detail in its origin story, and West treats it with a tenderness that feels touching after the brutalizations of the previous 36 minutes. It plays out, untouched and flowing, while West gives us as much of a devotional pledge as he feels capable of: "Ayo, we made it to Thanksgiving/ So ay, maybe we could make it to Christmas." This isn't hope, exactly, but it is a viable substitute. </p>

</p> <p>In this edition of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/">The Out Door</a>, we delve into the legacy of one of the most inspiring underground musicians of the past 40 years, the guitarist known variously as Guitar Roberts, Loren Mazzacane, and, for the past decade or so, <a href="http://fvrec.com/lorenconnors/biography.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Loren Connors</a>. He's a man of many ideas-- and many records-- but few words. In a sense, his speech matches his music: He talks in short, efficient phrases, almost always with a smile, but rarely with any unnecessary verbiage.</p> <p>So we've chosen to explore his work through the eyes of those who've played with and listened to him. We chat with his long-time creative partner and wife Suzanne Langille; gather testimonials from devoted collaborators such as <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5849-jandek/">Jandek</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/" target="_blank">Jim O'Rourke</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2474-alan-licht/">Alan Licht</a>, and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1795-david-grubbs">David Grubbs</a>; and offer our own take on some memorable Connors releases. But first, we assess this unique artist with the help of historian and friend William R. Ferris (and a few choice words from the man himself).</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/Connors.jpg" alt="" /><i><small>Photo by Hans van der Linden</small></i></p> <p><b>I:</b> <b>Loren Connors</b>: <b>The Narrative Never Stops</b></p> <p>Listening to the music of Loren Connors feels like reading a stranger's diary. He's released reams of records on tiny independent labels and by himself, steadily amassing a mountain of quietly confident and confessional instrumentals that, taken together, shape a rich and detailed portrait of one of the world's most singular and distinctive guitarists.</p> <p>By one estimate included in the liner notes to <i><a href="http://fvrec.com/lorenconnors/d/nightthrough.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Night Through</a></i>,<i> </i>a 2005 three-disc retrospective that collected many of Connors' early singles and suites, he had by then recorded more than 9,000 hours of music. He named many of his pieces for places he'd been, heroes he'd had, and instruments he loved, galvanizing that quality of a personal and perseverant journal. His music has documented periods of break-up and new love, absolute penury and, now, his domestic life in Brooklyn. Without words, Connors' pieces conjure romance and sadness, anger and anxiety, and, most importantly, the spaces between all those feelings, where emotions hang ambiguous and unresolved.</p> <p>His friends are also his collaborators, folks such as <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2044-keiji-haino/">Keiji Haino,</a> <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3874-thurston-moore/">Thurston Moore</a>, and his wife, Suzanne Langille. And his work is all improvised, a momentary feeling turned into an immortal document-- a running musical journal, if you will. "It's not an adrenaline rush," notes Jeff Hunt, the founder of erstwhile American experimental vanguard <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/42302-experimental-label-table-of-the-elements-completes-its-mission-throws-festival/">Table of the Elements</a>, a label responsible for a number of Connors' most notable releases. "It's immediate and personal, but it's not about showmanship."</p> <blockquote> <p class="pull">"I connect to the blues more than anything, even though <br />I don't sound  real bluesy. It's where I come from <br />and it's who I am." -- Loren Connors</p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, if you've never heard the music of Loren Connors, you've never heard anything quite like it, either. Though his particular techniques have sometimes shifted, and though he long ago left the acoustic for the electric, Connors' pieces have consistently etched slight but strong melodies into atmospheres of hum and hiss. Sometimes he bangs against the strings, creating crowded clouds of texture; at other points, he's plucked long, snarled leads from his strings. </p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/Screen%20Shot%202013-06-14%20at%2010.03.42.png" alt="" /></p> <p>In the early 1990s, doctors diagnosed Connors with Parkinson's Disease, something that he's said has not only energized his playing but focused it, too, forcing him to get to work before he can no longer play guitar. Some of his most vital material has come since the diagnosis, the peril giving even his quietest recordings a sense of absolute urgency. </p> <p>If that scenario sounds like the premise of a blues song, it's an appropriate reference for the 63-year-old Connors, who delved deep into the blues after the British invasion brought the sound back to America<b>. </b>"I connect to the blues more than anything, even though I don't sound real bluesy. It's where I come from, and it's who I am," Connors says from his Brooklyn apartment. "I heard it when I was a teenager, with <a href="http://www.muddywaters.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Muddy Waters</a> and <a href="http://www.howlinwolf.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Howlin' Wolf</a>. Every kid knew about them. Then I got into the more esoteric blues, like <a href="http://www.robertjohnsonbluesfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Robert Johnson</a>."</p> <p>While Connors' sound is certainly distinctive, to call him a complete original or some <i>sui generis</i> icon is to overlook the rich blues patchwork that forms the foundation of his oeuvre. That's a notion underlined by his lengthy relationship with Southern historian and cultural critic <a href="http://history.unc.edu/people/faculty/william-ferris/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">William R. Ferris</a>. In the mid 70s, just as Connors was releasing his first albums while living in New Haven, CT, Ferris taught at Yale, exploring American heritage and bringing blues artists to campus. As Connors recalls, he cleaned Ferris' office while working as a janitor and noticed the professor's wealth of blues ephemera and archives-- posters on the walls, books on the shelves.</p> <blockquote> <p class="pull">"His music is this extended, stretched form of expression-- <br />sound waves that never stop." -- William R. Ferris</p> </blockquote> <p>Years later, Ferris had relocated to Mississippi to teach in Oxford; Connors wrote to the professor, introduced himself and asked if Ferris could listen to his music and pen some liner notes for a release. They'd never met, and Ferris didn't specialize in so-called experimental music, but he recognized several familiar qualities in the tape Connors had sent. "I felt inadequate to do the liner notes because it was different than anything I'd ever encountered," Ferris says. "But there was a clear influence from the blues, which I could appreciate, and also classical music, Irish music, and Jewish klezmer music. I found it very exciting and very different from any music I'd ever heard."</p> <p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/47954846" width="620" height="345" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p>Ferris gushes about Connors, comparing the guitarist to Stephen Foster and William Faulkner in the matter of a few breathless sentences. Late last year, that enthusiasm inspired another young Connors fan-- Harrison Lee, then a senior taking Ferris' "Southern Music" class at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill-- to explore Connors' music at length. "Students will also write a term paper on any topic related to Southern music," the syllabus noted. "The paper is due at the end of the course."</p> <p>When Lee told Ferris that he wanted to explore intersections of Southern music and the avant-garde, Ferris asked if he'd ever heard of his old friend, Loren Connors. A DJ at the school's student-run radio station <a href="http://www.wxyc.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WXYC</a>, Lee had long been listening to Connors' music, using the impressionistic and eclectic guitar pieces to serve as segues between other acts. For Lee, Connors' music works much as it does for Ferris-- connecting disparate styles in a way that no one else has. Connors has always admitted to a heavy influence from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mark Rothko</a>, who produced canvasses of color that could swallow the viewer. In turn, Connors' syntheses of sound-- each piece and the massive web of material at large-- have that same sort of magnetism for Lee.</p> <p>"That wall of sound quality makes it really engulfing, and it's difficult to extricate yourself from it," he says. "It's almost like being in the ocean and overpowered by waves. There's a massiveness to it." Ferris, a blues scholar who hears that antediluvian American form in every note he's ever heard, keys on that same sense of personal grandeur: "His music is this extended, stretched form of expression-- sound waves that never stop. The narrative never stops."</p> <hr /> <p><b>II: A Selected Loren Connors Discography</b></p> <p>Loren Connors' catalog is so deep and highlight-filled that recommending particular titles seems almost silly. But it's also a lot of fun. Below is a list of some of our favorites, divided into three categories-- proper solo releases, compilations of solo work, and collaborative albums-- and listed chronologically. Think of this not as a best-of list, but the bait that will hopefully hook you into the rest of Connors' endless sea of wonderful music.

Best are the tracks where he seems to converse with himself, such as the melancholy but assertive "Sorrow in the House".</p> <p><b><i><a href="http://fvrec.com/lorenconnors/d/longnights.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Long Nights</a> </i></b><b>(Table of the Elements, 1995) </b></p> <p>At first, <i>Long Nights </i>feels like a standard Connors album,<i> </i>opening with a sparse, gradual melody. But it soon turns denser and noisier. There's more distortion and feedback than usual here, and some of Connors' note patterns nearly drown in the surrounding fuzz. But the tone is never desperate or stressed; in fact, the calmness of Connors' guitar waves makes <i>Long Nights </i>a tantalizing listen.</p> <p><b><i><a href="http://fvrec.com/lorenconnors/d/hellhellhellhellhell.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!</a></i></b><b> (The Lotus Sound, 1997)</b></p> <p>Now here's a tenser version of what <i>Long Nights </i>started. There's distortion and feedback again in these short, untitled pieces (12 of them in less than a half hour), but this time-- in keeping with the album's title-- they're angrier and more strident. Connors' trademark patience is still intact, but <i>Hell!</i>'s dark energy offers a different kind of excitement.</p> <p> <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="300" height="24" id="player-7516" name="player1"> <param name="movie" value="http://cdn.pitchfork.com/streaming-player/player.swf"> <param name="allowfullscreen" value="false"> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"> <param name="flashvars" value="file=09_For_NY_9_11_01__the_Silence.mp3&title=“For NY 9/11/01: the Silence” from The Departing of a Dream&lightcolor=EF4135&streamer=rtmp://s3w1mu85xbnhjc.cloudfront.net/cfx/st"> <embed id="player-7516" name="player-7516" src="http://cdn.pitchfork.com/streaming-player/player.swf" width="300" height="24" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="false" flashvars="file=09_For_NY_9_11_01__the_Silence.mp3&title=“For NY 9/11/01: the Silence” from The Departing of a Dream&lightcolor=EF4135&streamer=rtmp://s3w1mu85xbnhjc.cloudfront.net/cfx/st" />

Gross was speaking with the pair for "Invisible Jukebox", the long-running feature of the experimental music magazine <i>The Wire</i>, in which musicians listen to a set of unidentified (if sometimes familiar) recordings and talk about what they hear.</p> <p>It was the first mutual interview that Langille and Connors-- who've been collaborating on music, writing, art, and life at large since they met in 1984-- have ever given, and it was a revealing one. Whether it's a Connors solo album, a product of the two, an LP from their band <a href="http://northernspyrecords.com/artist/haunted-house/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Haunted House</a> or any one of myriad collaborations with others they've issued, there's an intimate magnetism to the music of Connors and Langille, as though a curtain's been lifted for an hour or so on a private and guarded world. They talked about ferocity and energy, composition and influences. Their responses to music from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Young" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lester Young</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_James" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Skip James</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bull" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sandy Bull</a> revealed their dovetailing outlooks and how they'd influenced one another, encouraging each other to reach further, to pursue the emotion or experience they wanted to convey harder.</p> <blockquote> <p class="pull">"It's been a decades-long interaction where we just get more <br />and more free. We're stripping things away and getting <br />more and more to the essence of pieces."</p> </blockquote> <p>But it was when Gross played "Welcome Welcome Emigrante", an old tune from songwriter <a href="http://www.creative-native.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Buffy Sainte-Marie</a>, that the personal gravity of Langille and Connors' work became clear: "This song in particular I don't like that much, because it sounds like an essay that was put to music," Langille said. "Essays are not music. Don't write an essay!" That reflects how the best of their music feels-- not a statement so much as a feeling, shared between partners and then with the rest of us.</p> <p>We spoke with Langille by phone late on a weeknight. Connors had played a show earlier in the evening, and he was asleep in another room. "Now I can say whatever I want," Langille said, laughing.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: You've said before that you and Loren had to adjust to each other musically after you first met, to figure out how to work together. Your music as a pair seems so natural to hear now, what was the challenge in starting?</b></p> <p>Suzanne Langille: I was a very bad musician. I was the world's worst guitar player, so when I was performing solo with a guitar, I had to keep things very simple. Working with Loren really freed me up, and the more abstract he got, the more freedom I had. It's been a decades-long interaction where we just get more and more free. We're stripping things away and getting more and more to the essence of pieces, which is what I like to do. I like spoken-word as much as the singing word. In our Haunted House band, I've done more with the spoken-word than the singing.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: What different feelings do singing words and speaking words in music elicit for you?</b></p> <p>SL: When I'm speaking, I'm more focused on the words as meaning. When I'm singing, I'm more focused on the words as sound. The emotion is more targeted when I'm speaking, more flowing when I'm singing.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Do those different treatments affect your musical relationship with Loren? Does he respond differently to those two modes? </b></p> <p>SL: He pays more attention when I'm speaking, which may be one of the reasons I speak more these days. [<i>Laughs</i>.] He likes it when I talk. He says I'm a shouter!</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/suzannelorenissue.jpg" alt="" /><i><small>Connors and Langille at Issue Project Room, 2012. Photo by Peter Gannushkin</small></i></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Your personal and musical relationships are obviously so intimate and intertwined. What's it like watching him collaborating with others?</b></p> <p>SL: He's done a lot of duets over the years with a lot of different people-- Jim O'Rourke, Alan Licht. One of the pairings that I actually liked a lot was when, during his birthday celebration, he <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ifpu_6ac8KY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">played with Chan Marshall</a>. Loren just came up with this: [<i>hums pretty melody</i>] I don't remember the song she was singing, but it was a beautiful pairing. That was when he turned 50, in 1999. It was at Tonic, and Thurston Moore put that together. He let Loren play four nights a week with all sorts of people he'd never met before. It was amazing. I said, "This is great, Loren. For your birthday, he's trying to kill you." <i>[Laughs.]</i></p> <p>A person I love with Loren, but now she's back in Lisbon, is <a href="http://margaridagarcia.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Margarida Garcia</a>, the bass player. The first time those two played together, I told him I didn't think he should ever play again without her.</p> <blockquote> <p class="pull">"We met in February of 1984, and by May we were living together. It just happened really fast. We kicked people and things <br />out of our life to make room for each other."</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Pitchfork: As you and Loren got freer, as you put it, did you discuss the shift, or did it simply happen by continuing to play? </b></p> <p>SL:<b> </b>It had to do with getting a Tascam [4-track tape recorder]. He was able to record against himself. It made everything a lot more flexible, and he was able to be a lot more true to himself. Some people have said, "Well, he's done this, and he's done that, and he's done folk music." Loren was never <i>really </i>a folk musician. But getting the Tascam and being able to play against himself in whatever way he wanted rather than depending on some other guitar to provide chords and things was very freeing for him. Eventually he got to the point where he didn't need to do that layering. He could do it all with his guitar.</p> <p>Any time you give him a new technology, a new toy, he starts doing something new. He gets a bigger amp, and we have <i><a href="http://family-vineyard.com/products/a-fire" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hell's Kitchen Park</a></i>. He gets a Vox amp, and you get <i><a href="http://family-vineyard.com/products/a-fire" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A Fire</a></i> and the things that he's doing now. Whatever you put in his hands, he finds a way to use it.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: How did you meet, and what was the attraction?</b></p> <p>SL: We had a mutual friend who had done sound for one of my concerts, and then asked me if I could help out at one of his. That's when I met Loren. He was also playing that night. It was at The Educational Center for the Arts in New Haven. What drew me to him that night was not his playing on the guitar. He did some playing on the piano, and at that time, he was more compositional when he was playing piano. It was the composition that caught my ear and drew me in. I have this thing for geniuses. We met in February of 1984, and by May we were living together. It just happened really fast. We kicked people and things out of our life to make room for each other. </p> <p><b>Pitchfork: Does experiencing his creativity inspire your own?</b></p> <p>SL: Absolutely. It's a really terrific experience. The main thing for me is the compositional quality of the music. When I got together with Loren, he was playing the guitar in an unusual way, and it was very improvisational. But when we did the <i><a href="http://fvrec.com/lorenconnors/d/bluesmaster2.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluesmaster 2</a></i> record, I was doing the chords to "Amazing Grace", very simple chords, and he came up with this amazing tune. That's when I started talking to him about how he should stop thinking of himself as a guitarist and start thinking of himself as a composer. That's what he is. He's a composer. </p> <p>I started being a little more engaged in helping him listen to his music. He would record a lot of stuff, and I would do a little star system and say what I thought were the best pieces. Eventually, I didn't have to do that anymore because he got into it himself. He started paying a lot more attention to how strong the compositional quality was. That was the role I played, I think, in his musical development. He played a role in my development, and I played <i>that</i> role in his.</p> <blockquote> <p class="pull">"I'm not the friend that you go and party and get drunk with. I'm the one that you go and take a long walk with if you've got <br />something on your mind and you need to talk."</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Pitchfork: When did you first recognize that symbiosis?</b></p> <p>SL: [When] Loren took a break from music. He did some writing. I had a background in literature, so he started asking for my advice. I started editing his writing, and it got to the point where he would look at something and say, "Now, did I write that, or is that something you did?" He couldn't tell. That was where that composition and editing relationship started. He started out writing longer things and then he got into shorter things and then he went into haikus, really great haikus. The compositions just got more and more pristine. When he got back into music, it just transferred right into it. That was a very good aesthetic exercise for him. </p> <p><b>Pitchfork: You said that Loren was never a folk musician, and he's scoffed at that word, too. But it's true that there have been major shifts in your output and his. What unites those phases? </b></p> <p>SL: Truth. Honesty-- not trying to manipulate. Being a channel for the spirit of music and not letting yourself get in the way or letting your desires or wishes get in the way. I find that when I listen to a lot of music, especially singers, I can tell what they want me to think of them. They may want me to think that they're passionate, or they may want me to think that they're beautiful or that they're sensitive or in pain or whatever. There's often a desire to create an impact on the audience and to make them feel or think a certain thing. To me, that's not art. That's manipulation. Having the self-discipline not to want anything for yourself when you perform or when you play or when you sing is a real challenge.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: But music seems to sell well when it tells people how to feel, not when it leaves room for ambiguity and so much interpretation. Do you ever wish this sort of music did find more people?</b></p> <p>SL: One person's music can't be for everybody. The music that we do is for the people who need it, the people who want it. It's for the people that will be nurtured by it, maybe healed by it. It's not for everybody because it's not entertainment. When music is for entertainment, that's a different reason for music. I like music that's entertaining sometimes, too, but that's not what I do. I'm not the friend that you go and party and get drunk with. I'm the one that you go and take a long walk with if you've got something on your mind and you need to talk.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: That's a luxury of not necessarily using music as your primary income source, correct? Tell me about your job.</b></p> <p>SL: I have two lives. I even have two names. During my day job, I'm Suzanne Mattei. I'm a public interest lawyer. I do environmental and health advocacy work. I've been doing that pretty much all my life. I go to war with people like Michael Bloomberg. Sometimes rather powerful people get mad at me-- Waste Management, Inc., and other people that want to do nasty things like build garbage incinerators and turn the air into hazardous waste dumps. I don't like that. I do that by day, and that's how I live. I've never had a lot, but I've had enough to get by. Loren used to work part time, but when he got hit with Parkinson's he couldn't do it anymore. </p> <p>Most musicians today can't just be musicians. They have to have some other source of income. That's a shame. The economy is different than it was. You used to be able to live on a lot less than you're able to live on now, and I think it does make it a lot more challenging for people. The music industry became more centralized, too, so that it's a superstar system. There used to be a lot more people on record labels, a lot more diversity in the music scene on commercial record labels. That's gone. But we've all benefited from the internet and the ability to do things online. It's freed a lot of people to get their music out there and not have to worry about pleasing some label A&amp;R person. </p> <p>The world has changed a lot, and some people think, "It's too easy to make music. There are too many people out there. How can you find what's good?" I'm thinking that decades and decades and decades ago, people lived in itty-bitty villages, and every village had its own musicians. They never heard about each other, but they made music in their own little village. That's how it was done. Now we have an internet village with lots of little alcoves here and there, people making music. That's okay. I like the changes, where there's more access, more freedom. People find each other.</p> <p><b>Pitchfork: You said the fact that more musicians need day jobs now is unfortunate, but it seems in your own life that has also inspired you. It's made you put more into your music because time is limited.</b></p> <p>SL: It works for me. It would be a lot harder if I weren't living with Loren. I come home everyday, and Loren has something new up on the computer screen. Or he's found some book or some record or some film. He's always presenting me with art of different types, and that's in my life every single day. I am cheating, because I'm not spending all those hours finding the stuff that Loren finds. I've got someone in my life on a daily basis who is always bringing me things to look at and listen to and think about. It makes it easier for me to keep the art side of my life vibrant. --Grayson Currin</p> <p><i><a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/9150-the-legacy-of-loren-connors/3/">Next: Thoughts on Connors from his collaborators Jim O'Rourke, Alan Licht, and more</a></i></p> <p><!--pagebreak--></p> <p><b>IV: The Sound is in Loren's Hands: Connors' Collaborators, Part One</b></p> <p>Since it often sounds so solitary, Loren Connors' music might seem ill-equipped for collaboration. But some of his best work has come in creative partnerships, some stretching over decades and some lasting for just a single session. The cast of characters is diverse, from Chan Marshall to Keiji Haino to Jandek. To hear them tell it, Connors leaves an indelible mark on the minds of everyone he plays with.

I submitted a solo guitar track, and Loren had a piece on the same side of the record as me. Before that I had read a couple of reviews of his albums in <i>Forced Exposure</i>, but then when I looked him up in the New Music Distribution Service catalog they described his stuff as "New Age-y bottleneck guitar," so I was confused. The track on <i>Breathe</i> did sound like slide, but it wasn't New Age. That's the 80s for you.</p> <blockquote> <p class="pull">"I think he is an artist who happens to use guitar, like I often joke that Herzog is a poet who happens to use a camera." -- Jim O'Rourke</p> </blockquote> <p>Then I went to see him play live in <a href="http://www.downtownmusicgallery.com/Main/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Downtown Music Gallery</a> in 90 or 91 and it turned out he wasn't playing slide-- he was just down-tuning the guitar and doing a lot of extreme string-bending. It blew me away to see that, and his personal aura was very strong-- this quality of being fragile but kind of intense at the same time. Even just looking at him sitting there with his guitar before he started to play, you knew this guy was the real deal. We played live for the first time at Downtown Music Gallery in January 1993. We did shows together relatively frequently for a while after that.</p> <p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eTFGFHUriZw" width="620" height="465" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p>Often when you listen to someone's music and then you look at something they've done in another medium it's hard to see a through-line, or connection. But if you see Loren's drawings and paintings, or his haiku poetry, the relationship to the music is immediately apparent. There are patterns in the way he works that are evident in all of his output. His aesthetic is consistent, even though the music itself has gone through many phases over the decades.</p> <p>[In 2005] we were playing the Instal festival in Glasgow, and at the soundcheck the amp Loren was using, a Fender Twin, sort of died, so a tech guy wheeled over a Roland JC 120. Now, the Roland is a solid state amp, not a tube amp like the Twin, so it's a pretty different animal. Loren plugged into the Roland, didn't touch a knob or make any adjustments, and he sounded <i>exactly</i> like he did through the Twin. It was uncanny. Most other guitarists, myself included, would have to struggle to get some equability with two amps that divergent. But it shows that like most of the greats, the sound is in Loren's hands, not an amp or a pedal. It's going to sound like him no matter what.</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/orourke.jpg" alt="" /><i><small>Jim O'Rourke</small></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/">JIM O'ROURKE</a> (</b><b>Produced and collaborated with Connors on <i>Hoffman Estates, <a href="http://fvrec.com/lorenconnors/d/inbern.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">In Bern</a>, </i>and <i><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12709-two-nice-catholic-boys/">Two Nice Catholic Boys</a></i>)</b></p> <p>I first heard about Loren from Henry Kaiser in 1990 or so, when I went out to Oakland to help organize his records [laughs]. I saw these Guitar Roberts records and Henry told me that I should check them out. I had never heard anything quite like it, especially as I was in the frame of mind that he was a "blues player" when I first dropped the needle. Henry was trying to get me to listen to more and more blues guitarists, which I wasn't really interested in, because it was so "guitar-istic" to me at the time. That was important for how Loren's music struck me-- it was really <i>not</i> guitar music, although of course it was, but it really occupied that place that music rarely does, where there's a sense of direct transference. Pretty amazing.</p> <p>[Loren's music] isn't really about the guitar as an instrument at all, although obviously I think he is a spectacular guitarist. But I think he is an artist who happens to use guitar, like I often joke that Herzog is a poet who happens to use a camera. He's one of those rare people who can play one note, and you know who it is immediately, and know who they are as a person.</p> <blockquote> <p class="pull"><span>"Like most of the greats, the sound is in Loren's hands, not an amp or a pedal. It's going to sound like him no matter what."-- Alan Licht</span></p> </blockquote> <p>Loren is in many ways the toughest person I've played with because he will blindside you with just one note, or lack of it, and throw you to you-don't-know-where. But of course I love that, and I usually am trying to do that myself in improvised situations (okay, almost everything). But I'm on the receiving end when it comes to Loren. But I love it.</p> <p>For the concert on our Hat Art CD, <i>In Bern</i>, we were playing in a museum. We're setting up and Loren asks me something, and I turn to him and the neck of my guitar goes to the left, and Loren sort of casually raises his hand and purses his lips in the way that he does, and I simultaneously see everyone around him with their mouths agape and eyes bulging out. I look to my left and the neck of my guitar is about one centimeter away from a giant Picasso. But Loren just went ahead and asked me his question anyways. That's Loren, cool as everything.</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/HauntedHouse.jpg" alt="" /><i><small>Haunted House: Loren Connors, Neel Murgai, Suzanne Langille, Andrew Burnes.

David, Bryan Fielden [also of San Agustin] and I went up from Atlanta, and we took some San Agustin tapes and records with us in case we ran into someone who might listen to us. Loren and John Fahey were sitting at the bar at the Empty Bottle, drinking non-alcoholic beers and talking about Parkinson's disease, and we were star-struck. We chatted them up, getting a grunted dismissal from Fahey, but Loren was friendly and talked for a bit.</p> <p>DD: I had been buying Loren's records for a while at that point-- there was a guy at the record shop (<a href="http://www.waxnfacts.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wax'n'Facts</a>) who would save me copies of any of Loren's records that came through-- in particular the 7-inches. I wound up with a pretty big collection of those.</p> <p>AB: Suzanne called me up a couple weeks later and asked if we could come up and play with them. That was the beginning of several permutations of the five of us (Loren, Suzanne, David, Bryan, and me) over the next couple years. Haunted House came soon after, when I moved to New York.</p> <blockquote> <p class="pull">"There was a period of time when I was flying to New York <br />(and maxing out my credit cards to do so) nearly monthly <br />to play with Loren." -- Darin Gray</p> </blockquote> <p>My admiration for Loren is based primarily on his commitment to his own music-- his willingness to play what he hears inside regardless of external pressures. That creates an interesting dynamic in Haunted House, when the rest of us are pushing and pulling, and sometimes Loren will only go so far to meet us. That tension is an important element in how we improvise and how we ultimately sound. I have become more patient playing with Loren.</p> <p>DD: To collaborate with Loren-- especially in a duo-- requires making a choice as to whether you want to follow his lead, or to play independently of him. He's a very assertive partner and playing one-on-one with him can often be uncomfortable, in the good way that pushes me to go places that I otherwise wouldn't. </p> <p>AB: One sunny spring day when I didn't yet know him very well, I needed to talk to Loren about something, and Suzanne told me to go to such-and-such address in Hell's Kitchen and he would be there. It was just a narrow, empty little space with a painted concrete floor and pipes running in and out of the walls. Over by the high little street-facing window was a wooden crate holding an old turntable and headphones, an amp, and a chair with Loren's Stratocaster laying on it-- nothing else in the room. I talked to Loren for a minute about whatever I needed, and he quietly picked up his guitar, sat down, put on his headphones, and put the needle on the record. He started playing soft blues licks to a beat I couldn't hear. I watched the record spinning around and figured out it was <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Faith_(Blind_Faith_album)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blind Faith</a></i>.

This is only his fourth known interview in a nearly 40-year musical career.)</b></p> <p>I didn't know Loren Connors before I first played with him. Barry Essen invited us to play <a href="http://www.furious.com/perfect/jandek/lorenconnors.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a show</a> in New York in 2005 [at <a href="http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anthology Film Archives</a>], and he selected who he thought would be the best players to play with-- Matthew Heyner [of No-Neck Blues Band] on bass and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6794-chris-corsano/">Chris Corsano</a> on drums. But then I wanted to add someone on guitar, kind of spacey guitar, and Barry recommended Loren. I had seen Loren's name as Loren Mazzacane many years ago in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op_Magazine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OP</a> </i>magazine, so I had heard of him.</p> <p>We didn't talk a whole lot [before the show]. I do remember he went out and looked at the audience, and came back to the green room beaming and saying, "It's full! There are no seats available!" He was like a kid when he saw that.</p> <p>I thought what Loren brought to the picture was perfect. I could not have asked for better. I liked his stage presence-- how he came out and just nailed the guitar, in a way that fit in with everything else but in no way was soft. It was present, but in a way that I have never heard the guitar come out before. There was no riff involved. Everything was unique. Just the whole picture of the way he is, what he projects from his persona, and the way he draws that into the guitar and produces the sound is overwhelming.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>"Nothing that Loren does reminds me of other people. He's a great man-- everybody knows that. And a great artist too."-- Jandek</p> </blockquote> <p>I played with him again in Glasgow in 2006. He played guitar and I played harmonica and sang. [Compared to the Manhattan show], his dynamism was different. It was a unique projection of sound from the guitar, with less volume. It was a quieter kind of performance for both of us, and it told a story. The line of vocals was from a dream, and he augmented that in a much different way.</p> <p>I also visited Loren and Suzanne at their home in Brooklyn. That's the only time I played guitar with him-- we played for about 45 minutes. That was ethereal. I think this was particularly sparse guitar playing. Loren was cutting out things from newspapers and making collages and had some on his walls. He was really excited by those collages.</p> <p>There's no way that I could not be influenced by Loren's playing. Once you hear it you can't take it out of your mind. I never thought of this before, but occasionally now I tap the strings over the pickups with my fingers. He does a lot of that, and I don't think I did it before [I played with him]. So it might have been a natural evolution on my part, or maybe I had a unconscious image of him doing that.</p> <p>I wouldn't say that Loren speaks abruptly... though I guess I'm kind of that way myself. He never talks about Parkinson's-- he never indicates that it interferes with anything. I wouldn't say he denies it, but he just sails right past it and does what he wants to do, and that's a beautiful aspect in life. To know your shortcomings and not care-- you do what you can, you do what you want to. You get up there and you play guitar and you perform in an exhilarating manner even if your hands don't work the way they used to. He finds another way to do it which goes beyond any debilitation, [where] so many people get stuck in their problems.</p> <p>Nothing that Loren does reminds me of other people. He's a great man-- everybody knows that. And a great artist too.</p> <p><i>To read the full transcript of our interview with Jandek, <a href="http://the-out-door.tumblr.com/post/53438923538/full-transcript-of-our-interview-with-jandek" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">visit our Tumblr page</a>.</i></p> <p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_2_cA5HcMhk" width="620" height="349" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p><b><a href="http://www.darin-gray.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DARIN GRAY</a> (The bassist played in the <i>Hoffman Estates </i>ensemble and made the duo records <i><a href="http://fvrec.com/lorenconnors/d/thelostmariner.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Lost Mariner</a> </i>and <i><a href="http://fvrec.com/lorenconnors/d/thispastspring.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">This Past Spring</a></i> with Connors)</b> </p> <p>I met Loren in Chicago through Jim O'Rourke. It is difficult for me to express just how important and life-changing Loren's music is for me. His music goes straight to the core and I feel like I am experiencing the root of something rather than a branch. There is just something magical about the way he shapes a single note, how he shapes a phrase, how he ties those notes and phrases together to create this unique narrative.</p> <p>The <i>Hoffman Estates</i> album was a real turning point for me-- just an incredible line up of great musicians and friends. The last track where Loren and I are playing duo a bunch was really the spark for us continuing to play together.</p> <blockquote> <p class="pull">"We started rolling the tape at 10 a.m. and we were finished by lunch time. He'd said what he needed to say by then." -- David Grubbs</p> </blockquote> <p><i>The Lost Mariner</i> was the first time I had spearheaded a recording on my own, outside of a band context. I was nervous and intimidated, but Loren was so encouraging and really in a way like a father figure. There was a period of time when I was flying to New York (and maxing out my credit cards to do so) nearly monthly to play with Loren. I really cherish that time. He was so encouraging and so giving.</p> <p>I would stay with him and Suzanne; we would go to art galleries and museums by day and play at night. Loren turned me on to so many artists that I had never heard of. I still have notes from that period that I refer to. He was throwing so much at me that I still haven't absorbed it all. He is always "on," always growing, always absorbing. Everything around him goes in and comes out the other side through his unique filter and vision.</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/DavidGrubbs.jpg" alt="" /> <i><small>David Grubbs</small></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1795-david-grubbs/">DAVID GRUBBS</a> (The guitarist and composer, a former member of Squirrel Bait, Bastro, and Gastr Del Sol, made <i><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5173-arborvitae-as-loren-connors-with-david-grubbs/">Arborvitae</a> </i>with Connors)</b></p> <p>I first became aware of Loren's music in 1990 when I took a chance and spent $3 on a used copy of Guitar Roberts' <i><a href="http://fvrec.com/lorenconnors/d/inpittsburgh.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">In Pittsburgh</a></i>. I found it in the stacks in <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2010/02/09/swan-song-dr-wax-closes-its-doors/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Wax's Hyde Park store</a> in Chicago. I knew nothing about it except the handmade cover, with a gauzy, haunting photo glued to a white sleeve. </p> <p>For me, <i>In Pittsburgh</i> was an inspiration to turn down and play at a more human volume, and to be aware of and responsive to the space around the music. Something of what people learn intellectually from John Cage, I learned intuitively from spending time listening to Loren. I love the pacing of his playing. Coming out of a post-punk power music scene myself, the unaccompanied and undistorted guitar of Guitar Roberts hit me as a wild and brave way to be. Really, no one else sounded like that. </p> <p>A couple of years later, I played <i>In Pittsburgh</i> for Jim O'Rourke, who loved it and got in touch with Loren. By then he was making records under the name Loren Mazzacane and was easier to find. Gastr del Sol asked Loren to share a bill with us at Bard College, and we first met him at Grand Central Station (he was the guy with the guitar standing at the foot of one of the staircases) and got to know him a bit better on the train. [Grubbs and O'Rourke would later reissue <i>In Pittsburgh </i>on their label <a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Dexter's%20Cigar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dexter's Cigar</a>.]</p> <p>[When we recorded together] Loren's preference was to record first thing in the morning. I think we started rolling the tape on <i>Arborvitae,</i> our duo album on Häpna, at 10 a.m. and we were finished by lunch time. He'd said what he needed to say by then, and I was all eyes and ears. The one time we played live as a duo was at the funeral chapel at Green Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. I played harmonium for part of the set. When we were playing for a bit prior to the show, Loren asked me if I could turn down the harmonium. Too good!</p> <p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/50582495?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="620" height="345" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p><b><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29205-bill-orcutt/">BILL ORCUTT</a> (The guitarist and former member of Harry Pussy collaborated with Connors in 2012 on a <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/label/NATCH/blog/Loren_Connors_and_Bill_Orcutt_Natch_8_Collaboration" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">live recording</a> at Black Dirt Studio)</b></p> <p><b></b>I first met Loren right before we started recording. The session was arranged by Keith Connolly and Jason Meagher [both of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/25868-no-neck-blues-band/" target="_blank">No-Neck Blues Band</a>]. I didn't know Loren prior to playing with him and didn't get to know him too well in our short time together, but I liked his records and was interested in playing with him. He's original. All my favorite guitar players-- Hendrix, Ulmer, Bailey, Fred McDowell, etc-- have a sound that feels "lived-in" and authentic to who they are, and I think that's true of Loren too.</p> <p>[The session] was a challenge for me because I'm uptight-- I like to tune, set the levels, sound check, etc-- and with Loren there was no prep, no discussion. He walked in, plugged in his guitar and that was it-- we were recording. Straight through, no breaks. I had to run over to my guitar. Loren had a tiny Vox amp cranked up with a bunch of pedals and he was just conjuring up these incredible clouds of distortion. Meanwhile, I had my Telecaster plugged into this giant Fender amp [with] no master volume, so I couldn't turn it up past one-- just a completely clean sound. I learned something about letting go and just reacting to what's happening.</p> <p>Loren showed up at the session in a New York Jets Mark Sanchez jersey, and then stripped it off in mid-improvisation without breaking his stride. It's the kind of move I wish I could pull off.</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/VanWissemLoren.jpg" alt="" /><i><small>Loren Connors and Jozef Van Wissem</small></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30210-jozef-van-wissem/">JOZEF VAN WISSEM</a> (The lute player has recently performed a number of times with Connors)</b></p> <p><b></b>What led me to play with Loren is his economic use of the electric guitar. I like that it's hard to figure out how he gets his sound. Other musicians usually try to impress you with technique which is rather boring. What I learned from him is not to play at times.</p> <p>We met when I was curating the <i>New Music for Old Instruments</i> festival at Issue Project Room in Brooklyn. The day before the festival we set up in this marble temple with huge ceilings. The room has a six-second echo so everything you do gets magnified. We played this 40-minute arc in which he started from silence to almost loud rock. At the end of the piece, I hit the fragile surface of my lute a few times-- I almost destroyed it.</p> <p>My favorite Loren Connors moment was at Our Lady of Lebanon church in Brooklyn last year. It was almost silence, just the sound signal coming from his amp for a long stretch of time-- like the end of music. One time I went to see him at Printed Matter, an art book store in Chelsea. The place was packed and the people were quite loud which annoyed me. I would have turned up my amp but Loren reacted by playing even more quietly.</p> <p>Once, he came to a show of mine and showed up in full football gear, all decked out in red. Or maybe it was baseball. I am no good at sports.</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/KathBloomLoren.jpg" alt="" /><i><small>Loren Connors and Kath Bloom</small></i></p> <p><b><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5083-kath-bloom/">KATH BLOOM</a> (The singer/songwriter collaborated with Connors on at least 12 records in the 1970s and 80s)</b></p> <p><b></b>On this strange day, the sun is blaring out from behind the dark rainy clouds that have plagued us all week. Now we step down from the porch and see how happy and vital all the green things are; the flowers are robust and bursting! That is how it was to know Loren and his music. A dark storm that feeds you even if you don't know it. He showed me a way into myself when I desperately needed a road. It was not an easy road: rocky, and narrow, and so hot it burnt my feet! It was the road to art, to expressiveness... which we all need. Primal and exacting.</p> <p>I was much more the difficult person when we played music, I am sure. Loren was not casual but tremendously focused. Hard to keep up with, he taught me so much. His energy, his direction, and fierce devotion changed me forever. When I wrote a simple song in those days, whatever compelled it, it was always for him and his guitar. All the longing, stillness, doubt, and fortitude is in his playing. Open yourself and wake up!</p> <p class="p1"><i>To find out what these collaborators think are Connors' best records, <a href="http://the-out-door.tumblr.com/post/53438873196/loren-connors-collaborators-pick-their-favorite" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">visit our Tumblr page</a>.</i></p>

</p> <p class="p1"><i><small>Photo by Angel Ceballos</small></i></p> <p class="p1">Over the last four years, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/">Zola Jesus</a>' Nika Roza Danilova has relentlessly chiseled away at her own sound. To observe the evolution up-close, consider the three versions of her ballad "Sea Talk". <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZTfMqPRA8U" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The first</a>, from 2009's <i>Tsar Bomba </i>EP, is caked in noise, her voice bellowing out of a crackling phone line. Next was <i>Stridulum II</i>'s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlddZf9R0jU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoothed-out remake</a> from 2010, with heavenly synths replacing the distortion. And now we get the clearest take yet from her forthcoming album <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/51087-zola-jesus-teams-with-jim-thirlwell-aka-foetus-for-new-album/"><i>Versions</i></a>-- out August 20 on <a href="http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sacred Bones</a>-- which offers tasteful orchestral re-imaginings of her songs arranged by experimental vet <a href="http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/1527-foetus/">JG Thirlwell</a>. On this latest "Sea Talk", her siren blare of a voice is toned down, exposing an understated vulnerability. </p> <p class="p1"><i>Versions</i> began with a collaborative show with Thirlwell at New York's Guggenheim Museum last year, which Danilova calls "the most defining performance in my career" thus far. "I realized I didn’t have to bark, scream, or turn myself inside out," she continues. "I could express the songs dynamically, which was something I was afraid to do before. I thought being quiet was like being afraid but, in fact, it’s <i>screaming</i> all the time that's being afraid."</p> <p class="p1"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pLOhCQmmAaI?rel=0" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1">The 24-year-old is calling from a small island near Seattle, where she's currently writing music for her fourth album, due out next year. While the record is still in a nebulous stage, Danilova's planning to record it in a proper studio, unlike her previous, home-recorded LPs. And though she's still deciding the exact direction the music will take (for now, she describes it as "kinetic" and "very big" and "forward-moving") one thing is certain: It will not sound like anything she's done before.</p> <p class="p1">"If I were to make a record like <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13987-stridulum-ep/"><i>Stridulum</i></a> again, it would be artifice," she says, talking about her breakthrough 2010 release. "The record I’m working on right now is completely different, and that’s fine, because I’m a different person now. I can do whatever I want. I don’t have a band or a contract. It's exciting, but it's also daunting."</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>"I envy those people who make a debut album, and it's <br />like: <i>bam!</i> Everything is there. For me, it’s been <br />a slow process. But it’s getting there."</p> </blockquote> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: What attracted you to redoing your songs for <i>Versions</i>?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>ZJ: I’ve always felt like I let the songs fall short, like they were never able to become final. And working in an orchestral world is fun because the songs don't have to be reliant on production tricks. It's just the essence. I take pride in having the ability to communicate my songs with just a piano, or a string quartet, or my voice. If I could do an a cappella album, I would. All I care about is the vocal melody, everything else seems like dressing.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Are you generally hard on yourself when it comes to your music?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>ZJ: I feel like I haven't gotten to that point where there’s this universal feeling that I've done my defining work-- and that’s really stressful! [<i>laughs</i>] I’ve endured this feeling from people, like, “Wow! You had something that was pretty good-- can't wait to see what you do next!” Even if you don’t want to think about it, as a musician, I’m like, “Well, what do you want from me? I’ve given you everything I have.” I envy those people who make a debut album, and it's like: <i>bam!</i> Everything is there. For me, it’s been a slow process. But it’s getting there.</p> <p class="p1">But the more music you make, the more you struggle, because your instincts become tired, in a way. So I’ll sit down at the piano and play [<i>mimics heavy chords</i>] and I’m like, “Oh, that’s ‘Run Me Out’, can’t do that.” I’ve spent those instincts. So now it’s time to experiment with sevenths and diminished chords and try to find myself in those things instead.</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/verszi.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: You wrote your early material in Wisconsin, where you grew up, and then you wrote <i>Conatus</i> in L.A. Now you're writing on an island in the Pacific Northwest-- do you feel like you're especially influenced or inspired by place?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>ZJ: Definitely. But being here is so peaceful-- I almost feel this sense of completeness, which is not good for writing. If you feel complete, there’s nothing you could possibly want to say in a song. It’s actually starting to make me go insane. I’m moving out next week and I feel very ready because I can only be a domesticated hermit for so long.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: You also got married a couple years ago, do you feel like that’s affected your writing at all?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>ZJ: Not being concerned with love-- because I’ve already got that handled-- makes break-up songs hard. And, I mean, musicians love to write break-up songs. It’s an endless well of creativity. But I don’t want to write love songs anyway. I’m a highly self-deprecating person, so I get inspiration from self-loathing-- no need to find drama from the outside. [<i>laughs</i>]</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Where are you thinking about going lyrically for the new album? </b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>ZJ: That’s the one thing that I’ve struggled with the most, because, on <i>Conatus</i>, it was all about an inward sense of awkwardness and anxiety. But I cannot write another song like that, because having to tour on those songs gets really tiresome. It makes you not enjoy anything. For instance, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxTbGqFUG4s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“Collapse”</a> is one of my favorite songs on <i>Conatus</i> because it's the most forthright. The lyrics are “hurts to let you in,” and I’m singing that about the people listening to the record. I want to offer everything I have, but at the same time, I’m so scared of peeling the layers back. So while that record is very cathartic, it was also very destructive. And from that comes progression. So, on this new record, I'm making a conscious decision to sing songs about overcoming, which can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: You <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8595-rising-zola-jesus/">studied philosophy</a> in college, are you still interested in it now that you've graduated?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>ZJ: For my past couple of records, philosophy has been really important because, to me, it's the study of people, being, life, why we’re here-- not in a theological way, but in a more practical way. And that’s spilled over into my lyrics. I have my shelf with all my mainstay books that I go to when I feel like I need to consult someone: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Schopenhauer</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nietzsche</a>, all the bleak men. They’re like my therapists. But right now, I look at them and think, “I can’t go down that road.” I want to feel hopeful, and while they do give me hope, the idea of nihilism frustrates me, too. Like, if there’s no point in doing anything, I won’t do anything.

</p> <p>In 2010, <i>Vanity Fair</i> published a story that practically begged for a film adaptation. <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/03/billionaire-girls-201003" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“The Suspects Wore Louboutins”</a> gave the true account of a crew of wealth and fame-obsessed teenagers who burglarized the Hollywood homes of celebrities like Paris Hilton and “The Hills” cast member Audrina Patridge, stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cash and luxury goods for months on end without anyone realizing it. The tale, a juicy constellation of fame, wealth, and crime, seemed perfectly suited to become a big-budget pop thriller a la <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>. Instead, it got a muted interpretation from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001068/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sofia Coppola</a>, who tells the story through her characteristically eerie, vacant lens. In what’s been pegged as an indictment of celebrity culture, Coppola bypassed the original article's potential for Hollywood hoopla with her fifth feature film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2132285/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>The Bling Ring</i></a>.</p> <p>The visceral <i>zing </i>of the story, then, is carried largely on the shoulders of <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/6irzXls67xloqCMyzzFTJj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the film’s soundtrack</a>, a glittering, ultra-hip collection of highlights of the last three years of pop-oriented rap and rap-oriented pop, with some krautrock and ambient arrangements sprinkled in for atmosphere. <i>The Bling Ring</i>'s madcap high-schoolers rap along to Rick Ross’ “9 Piece” as they drive to the beach; they squeeze into short skirts and light cigarettes in their bedrooms with Reema Major’s “Gucci Bag” blasting in the background. The underage thieves dance at the sorts of clubs that play <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Jv9fNPjgk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Azealia Banks’ “212”</a> and drunk-drive while mouthing the immortal words of M.I.A.: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYs0gJD-LE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">“Live fast, die young/ Bad girls do it well.”</a> Their chains hit their chests when they’re banging on the dashboard.</p> <p>The Bling Ringers also listen to quite a bit of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/"><i>Twisted Fantasy</i></a>-era <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/">Kanye West</a>, an artist who’s now in the midst of his own <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/50795-watch-kanye-west-debuts-black-skinhead-on-saturday-night-live/">complicated campaign</a> against celebrity obsession and consumerism. When I ring up Coppola and her long-time music supervisor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0718687/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brian Reitzell</a> to chat about the soundtrack, they explain that West’s involvement in the film went beyond the appearance of “POWER” and “All of the Lights”: The two approached him in the film’s early stages in the hopes that he’d record original music and help orchestrate the score. Due to conflicting schedules, the full-blown collaboration was not to be. But Kanye did offer to license material from <i>Twisted Fantasy</i> for the film... and mentioned a little song he knew of, long before its official release, that sounded appropriate given the themes at hand: <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/">Frank Ocean</a>’s “Super Rich Kids”. And once other artists realized Kanye had cosigned the project, the difficult licensing process began to loosen and flow, resulting in one of the most lively soundtracks of the year, and proving the power of celebrity moves in all sorts of directions.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>"I’ve had to use bad music in movies because I needed it to reflect the character, but I can’t do that with Sofia’s movies." -- Brian Reitzell</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Pitchfork: This is the first Sofia Coppola movie that uses rap music.</b></p> <p>Brian Reitzell: We knew we needed music that the kids would listen to-- we had to do hip-hop. Neither of us listen to tons of current music, so I had to catch up. Originally, we wanted to bring Kanye West on to work with us. I haven’t worked with a lot of hip-hop artists, and it’s kind of its own universe, in some ways-- but not so much with Kanye. Sofia had met him, and he likes <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/">Phoenix</a> [which is fronted by Coppola's husband Thomas Mars], so I was trying to connect Phoenix and Kanye together to do a track. The scheduling was too difficult, though.</p> <p>Sofia Coppola: I also remember the blonde girl from the story kind of being the fake thug, so she had to be listening to Rick Ross. I asked my friend’s 12-year-old what would be the most hardcore Rick Ross song and he picked “9 Piece”. When the DJ was playing music for us in the club to dance to, Emma [Watson] really liked Azealia Banks’ “212”. That’s how it ended up in the movie. She had some of her friends join her in the scene as extras; she likes to dance. I was impressed that she busted out those moves out there.</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/blingring624zz.jpg" alt="" /><i><small>Emma Watson in The Bling Ring</small></i></p> <p><b><b>Pitchfork:</b> What did you personally listen to in high school? Did the characters’ rebellion resonate with you at all?</b></p> <p>SC: I listened to things like <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/">the Clash</a> and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/835-elvis-costello/">Elvis Costello</a>. I lived in Napa, so we would go see bands in San Francisco. It was kind of the beginning <a href="http://www.subpop.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sub Pop</a>, and it was exciting to go and see <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2860-mudhoney/">Mudhoney</a> and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/17834-firehose/">fIREHOSE</a>. I had my teen behavior, but nothing too out of control. Oh! In the movie, a character sneaks into her boyfriend’s house holding a gun; I remember sneaking into my boyfriend’s window back then. I didn’t have a gun, but yeah.</p> <p><b><b>Pitchfork:</b> You wanted to pick stuff that teens would be into, but the soundtrack is hip in a way that’s probably not representative of too many 16-year-olds.</b></p> <p>SC: I wanted the soundtrack to be in that world, but I also wanted good music that we would want to hear.</p> <p>BR: I guarantee you those kids weren’t listening to <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/">Can</a> and Klaus Schulze, or even M.I.A. You’ve just got to use your ears and put in music that’s good, because good music is really kind of timeless. Shitty music is just shitty music, and a lot of it is really popular. There’s nothing worse than being stuck with a bad song. At times, I’ve had to use bad music in movies because I needed it to reflect the character, but I can’t do that with Sofia’s movies.</p> <p>There’s a club scene where they get a bottle of Grey Goose with sparklers. There’s electronic club music blasting-- it’s a huge <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30466-avicii/">Avicii</a> hit. You probably don’t recognize it because once it gets to the hook-- this cheesy sort of techno riff-- I time-stretched the piece of music and it became this piece of atmospheric music. I did that with a <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5378-bassnectar/">Bassnectar</a> song, too.</p> <p><b><b>Pitchfork:</b> How did <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28390-sleigh-bells/">Sleigh Bells</a> become the centerpiece of the tracklist? Their music has been in a number of films recently.</b></p> <p>SC: I wanted it to just be obnoxious and hyper, like you’re along for the ride with these characters. Thomas [Hedlund], Phoenix's drummer, knew Sleigh Bells, and that’s how I knew about “Crown on the Ground”. I wrote the opening scene to that song and played it on set.</p> <p>BR: That song has so much digital clipping and distortion because of the way that it’s made, so I talked to [Sleigh Bells’] Derek Miller pretty early on about trying to clean it up a little bit. But we couldn’t fix it, because that’s the charm of the song-- the sound of that digital distortion really epitomizes the movie.</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/blingring624.jpg" alt="" /><i><small>Taissa Farmiga, Israel Broussard, Emma Watson, Katie Chang and Claire Julien in The Bling Ring</small></i></p> <p><b><b>Pitchfork:</b> There's a lot of singing-while-driving in this movie-- did the actors choose any of those songs that they sang along with, or did you write them in?</b></p> <p>SC: We had to pick songs before we shot them, and I’m really grateful that we got permission to use those songs.</p> <p>BR: There’s a scene in the movie where they’re in the car singing along to Kanye West’s “All of the Lights”. That’s a song with, like, 14 side artists-- huge people like Alicia Keys, John Legend, Drake. The label told us it was unclearable: “You cannot clear this song, there are too many people.” But I felt that if Kanye said yes, then the rest of the artists would. With the hip-hop world, when people like Rick Ross were made aware that Kanye was saying yes, then maybe it was cool with them, too. It certainly wasn’t a big paycheck. But these things are snowballs. So we took a leap of faith and shot the scene before we cleared the track.</p> <p><b><b>Pitchfork:</b> Do you feel it’s important for the musicians to approve of the films they’re featured in?</b></p> <p>BR: I’m not a lawyer, so I always approach the music as somebody’s child, you know? You’ve got to respect it. You can’t just use it as wallpaper, unless it’s a certain kind of room you need to decorate. With our movies, I always try to be sure the artists know, and I even try to show them the scene. But because of the scheduling with this one, I couldn’t show it to anyone.</p> <p>Frank Ocean had denied the use of “Super Rich Kids”-- he just has a blanket denial on anybody licensing his music for films. The label said no, and I had to go through a friend to get to his managers. Sofia cut up a trailer-like video from the movie to send to him, and he agreed. It’s cool because we’re putting the soundtrack out on vinyl, and I don’t think “Super Rich Kids”, and many of these tracks, have ever been released on vinyl before.</p> <p>SC: I have a feeling Kanye put in a good word for us.</p> <p><b><b>Pitchfork:</b> Why do you think Frank Ocean doesn't want his music used in films?</b></p> <p>BR: For the same reasons Kanye’s on his whole anti-corporate, no-logo thing. Music as a business is a dirty thing. I feel like Frank is this unpretentious, straight-up guy with a great voice who is creative-- he’s real, across the board. It’s who he is as a human being. He just doesn’t want to be exploited in that way, and I don’t blame him.</p> <p><b><b>Pitchfork:</b> There’s a lot of music, but there’s also a lot of silence in this film.</b></p> <p>BR: I really don’t like the way most movies and TV shows are supervised-- I hate when there’s someone singing over dialogue, songs just thrown in there. It’s out of control and it’s getting worse. The library companies have made it so that music is so cheap to license. They do sound-alikes of every band, and it makes it harder for the actual bands to get any decent paychecks for licensing. It’s just a very excessive time. Hopefully we’ll inspire some people to use music with a little more respect. There’s never anything gratuitous in Sofia’s movies.</p>

</p> <p>It's 10:30 a.m. on a sunny Wednesday morning in June, and I'm in a dim room on the fourth floor of the Brooklyn Museum with two members of the Russian feminist punk group <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/30623-pussy-riot/">Pussy Riot</a>, staring down a porcelain sculpture of <a href="http://www.okeeffemuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Georgia O'Keeffe</a>'s vagina. Curator Catherine Morris is giving us a private tour of the museum's <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art</a>, the only permanent collection of its kind in any major American museum. We eventually arrive at its centerpiece: American artist Judy Chicago's seminal and wildly controversial 1979 installation <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/dinner_party/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>The Dinner Party</i></a>. The visually imposing work is comprised of a giant, triangular table for 39, each place set for an important woman in (or, in most cases, written out of) history: unnamed Amazon goddesses, Sacajawea, Sojourner Truth. Except for a few overhead lights that dot the ceiling like distant stars, the room is reverently dark. Morris explains it's so the hand-embroidered runners on each place setting don't fade over time, but it also gives the room an uncanny arts-and-crafts-in-outer-space vibe. Taking in <i>The Dinner Party</i> from afar, I feel like I'm looking at a radical feminist Starship Enterprise.</p> <p>As we get closer, the most controversial part of the piece becomes clear: The design on each plate is abstractly yet unmistakably vaginal. "It might be hard to believe now," Morris says, gesturing towards O'Keeffe's plate, an impressionistic swirl of sky-blues and lilacs that looks a little bit like one of her paintings, "but 40 years ago, this was deemed obscene." The taller of the two members of Pussy Riot, who goes by the name Headlight, lifts her teal digital camera and snaps a picture.</p> <p>They've chosen seemingly random nicknames for their trip to America (the other one is Puck), and when we meet outside the museum half an hour earlier, they tell me, with the help of a translator, that it doesn't matter who's who or who’s saying what. In Pussy Riot, individuals are subsumed by the goals and identity of the collective as a whole.</p> <p>In small talk, Puck and Headlight are friendly but guarded. As we walk up to the fourth floor, I ask how long they've been in New York, and they politely decline to answer. They've come to the U.S.-- on the heels of a similar whirlwind tour in Europe-- to make connections with musicians, human rights groups, and like-minded activists, but they’re also constantly aware of the potential danger they'll face when they go back to Russia. Before we enter the Sackler Center, they remind me one last time of the ground rules we’ve agreed upon for this article: no real names, no physical descriptions, and absolutely no photographs.</p> <p>But after we spend some time taking in <i>The Dinner Party</i> (which they both love), they’re faced with a predicament. Judy Chicago is apparently ecstatic that the girls have come to see her piece, but bummed that she couldn’t be there to meet them in person. A museum photographer and his assistant have shown up, gear in hand, to ask for a photo of the girls to give to the artist. Puck and Headlight are hesitant at first, but after chatting among themselves, they reach a compromise. “Only if we can change first.”</p> <p>The museum opens in 10 minutes, and just to be safe, Rob Lieber, an American who helps run the website <a href="http://freepussyriot.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">freepussyriot.org</a> and is acting as Puck and Headlight’s de facto press liaison, wants to make sure we leave before the general public starts filing in. There’s no time to make it down to the restroom a couple of floors below, so Morris apologetically ushers the pair-- who are wearing a variation on the standard New York summer-tourist uniform-- into a nearby closet to change. Two minutes later, the unassuming girls I’ve been talking to for the past hour dart out in a blur of bold colors-- those already-iconic tights, dresses, and balaclavas. I can tell from their body language that the uniform, or perhaps the familiar comfort of anonymity, gives them a jolt of almost-superhuman confidence. I get chills as they breeze past me to take their place before <i>The Dinner Party</i>. It’s like seeing Superman bust out of a phone booth. </p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>It’s now against the law for a Russian citizen to speak ill <br />of the government to the foreign press-- which is what <br />Puck and Headlight are doing at this very moment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Pussy Riot formed on September 24, 2011, the same day Vladimir Putin made the controversial announcement that he'd seek a third term as President of Russia. "At that point," a member of the group recalled in a 2012 <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/A-Russian-Pussy-Riot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">interview with Vice</a>, "We realized that this country needs a militant, punk-feminist street band that will rip through Moscow's streets and squares, mobilize public energy against the evil crooks of the Putinist junta and enrich the Russian cultural and political opposition." Citing oi!-punk and the riot grrrl movement as inspiration, they wrote fast, furious protest songs with titles like "Putin Has Pissed Himself" and staged guerilla-style performances in increasingly daring locations: outside a subway station, in a boutique, and later in the heart of Red Square. On February 21, 2012, intending to protest the entanglement of church and state in Putin's Russia, five members participated in the group's most audacious performance yet. They entered Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, stormed the altar, and began to perform to a recording of a new song, "Virgin Mary, Put Putin Away". They were detained after about 40 seconds, and a few days later three members-- Nadezhda "Nadia" Tolokonnikova, Maria "Masha" Alyokhina and Yekaterina "Katya" Samutsevich-- were taken into custody.</p> <p>Last summer, people all over the world were captivated by Pussy Riot's chillingly theatrical trial. As Nadia, Masha, and Katya sat in a glass box and shot looks of defiance and eye-rolling disbelief to the assembled media circus (Nadia: "I still can't shake the feeling that I've spent the last six months acting in a big-budget movie"), Western artists and activists voiced solidarity and demanded their release. Videos of their performances went viral. People donned balaclavas and organized rallies all over the world, Amnesty International declared them "prisoners of conscience," and a long list of musicians including Madonna, Björk, Paul McCartney, Green Day, and Patti Smith spoke out in support. The overwhelming global attention surprised people in Russia (where the public opinion of them wasn’t terribly high), but even in America, it felt like an oddity: At a time when every other week seems to bring an article pronouncing the death of either feminism or punk rock, to see a madcap, menacingly articulate all-female punk group making headline news was nothing short of a revelation. Still, pressure from the rest of the world didn't affect the verdict. All three were found guilty of the vague charge of "hooliganism motivated by religious hatred." After the appeal, Katya was set free (her lawyer pointed out that she hadn't had time to plug in her guitar and reach the altar before she was detained), but Nadia and Masha were sent to serve two-year sentences in penal colonies, where they remain today. At the time of Puck and Headlight’s visit, Masha had just ended an 11-day hunger strike, protesting the prison’s conditions.</p> <p>Puck and Headlight-- who, for their own safety, won't reveal whether or not they played a part in the Christ the Saviour performance-- have come to the U.S. ostensibly to promote <a href="http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/pussy-riot-a-punk-prayer/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Pussy Riot: A Punk Prayer</i></a>, Maxim Pozdorovkin and Mike Lerner's festival-favorite documentary that premiered this week on HBO. But judging by their New York itinerary (which includes meetings with activists from Occupy Wall Street, the Willie Mae Rock Camp for Girls, and culture jammers the Yes Men), they're not interested in the PR cycle so much as having intimate conversations with like-minded people.</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/pussyriot6243.jpg" alt="" /><i><small>Photo courtesy of the film Pussy Riot: A Punk Prayer</small></i></p> <p>On Monday night, two days before our museum tour, they're at <a href="http://bluestockings.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluestockings</a>, a radical bookstore on the Lower East Side, for an unannounced Q&amp;A. "We're very excited, and a little bit nervous," the moderator says to the assembled group of about 50. The girls have agreed to appear before us without their masks (wisely: the balmy June air feels extra thick in the un-air conditioned space), but before they speak, the moderator makes us raise our hands and take an oath that we won't record, take pictures, or tweet about the event for at least two days.</p> <p>The reason for all the secrecy and nervousness soon becomes clear. Puck tells the crowd that, in the past month, Russian legislators have passed a series of laws informally known as "Pussy Riot laws"-- basically because they preemptively make any behavior the group might engage in illegal. It's now a crime to cover your face in Russia (whether it's a balaclava or an herbal face mask, Puck quips) or offend a believer of the Russian Orthodox Church. But perhaps most disturbingly, it’s now against the law for a Russian citizen to speak ill of the government to the foreign press. Which is what Puck and Headlight are doing at that very moment.</p> <p>When the floor opens up for questions, attendees are curious to know if this is the girls' first time in America (it is), what sort of contact they've had with Nadia and Masha (minimal, though the free members are able to write them letters), and if Pussy Riot are planning any upcoming performances (it's too risky in Russia at the moment).</p> <p>"In Russia, they're much more afraid of the word ‘riot,’" Puck says, adding with a laugh, "In America, they seem to be more afraid of the other word." For the most part, Headlight is quiet, but-- like almost every other time I’ll see her that week-- her camera is pointed unwaveringly at us, with the red light on.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>"It seems like most Americans believe some stereotypical notion that feminism was just a fight for women to be worse-looking."</p> </blockquote> <p>Puck and Headlight are a little more laid back on Wednesday afternoon, when we sit down to talk at a corner table at the Brooklyn Museum's cafe. Puck leisurely spoons the foam off the top of her cappuccino; Headlight offers me a bite of her Hershey bar-- she's been dying to try one since they've arrived. "In Russia," she says, in an uncharacteristic moment of levity, "We don't have such a variety of chocolate."</p> <p>They say their trip to America has been "unforgettable," but you can tell they're a little fatigued. They're scheduled to make a surprise appearance at the HBO-hosted <i>Punk Prayer</i> premiere later that night (this time with balaclavas on), and midway through our conversation, Rob cuts in to let them know that the few hours of downtime they've built into their day are now on the chopping block; more journalists keep calling. They're good sports about it, though. Speaking freely to the press is a luxury they don't have right now in Russia, where most media is state-sponsored. Four of Pussy Riot's five videos have now been banned as "extremist" in their home country, which means that Russian journalists who so much as quote their lyrics or link to one of their songs can be sued.</p> <p>Even so, when I ask what's surprised them most about America so far, Puck quickly answers, "How many problems we have in common-- there's still a very negative portrayal of feminists [in America], too." She’s been inspired by the other young women she’s met here, but a little dismayed to find that, as in Russia, the movement’s essential message of equality has been bogged down by misconceptions. As our translator relays Puck's next observation, she shakes her head and laughs in consensus. "It seems like most Americans believe some stereotypical notion that feminism was just a fight for women to be worse-looking."</p> <p>The girls both agree that Pussy Riot couldn't have formed or had global influence without the internet. Embracing the viral music video as a form of protest has helped them break barriers like ticket prices and geography, letting an unprecedentedly large audience be “present” for Pussy Riot’s performances. But what they call the "open source" goal of the leaderless, horizontally-structured group presents its own challenges, too.</p> <p>In November, Samutsevich spoke out against her former lawyer, Mark Feygin, who allegedly tried to trademark the Pussy Riot name without the group's consent. (They're strictly against making a profit off of anything Pussy Riot-related and make an effort to "distance themselves from any attempts to exploit [their] brand.") There was also a controversial, decidedly <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/47959-pussy-riot-like-photo-removed-from-ikeas-website/">Pussy Riot-esque photo</a> in an online Russian IKEA ad (later removed).</p> <p>And let's not forget that<i> other</i> group of girls who gained recent notoriety for crimes they committed while wearing neon balaclavas: At Bluestockings, amidst questions about Putin, Chechnya, and Ukrainian protest group FEMEN, someone asks Pussy Riot if they've seen <i>Spring Breakers</i>. Headlight has. She calls it a "horrible film" that "exploits" Pussy Riot's imagery to spread a message that goes against everything that the group stands for. (Many viewers have pointed out the resemblance, but director Harmony Korine claims it's just <a href="http://cinema-scope.com/currency/spring-breakers-harmony-korine-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"an awesome coincidence."</a>) Interestingly enough, it's not the film's sex and violence that bothers her; the particular scene she lashes out against is the one in which the girls aren't paying attention in history class. As Nadia, Masha, and Katya's literate and well-informed closing statements (which also went viral) attest, Pussy Riot advocate an in-depth knowledge of history, if only to know how to fight against it in a meaningful way.</p> <p>Still, they understand that when your image is so iconic, reappropriation is the nature of the beast-- or maybe even the whole point. “The way we do our activism is open-source,” Puck says. “So we understand that other artists will come and make their own take on it. That’s OK-- that’s actually a crucial part of it… even with the image of the balaclava, it’s not about us per se, but it’s about the ideology, spreading that idea along.”</p> <p>Headlight jumps in and suggests a metaphor that the translator doesn’t understand. Instead she turns to me, and the universal language of punk: “Like… straight edge?” I nod in recognition, and she goes on. “Straight edge is no longer about who started it, it’s about everyone’s individual interpretation, and the people who uphold it [as a lifestyle.]”</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p>Pussy Riot give us is a new model-- proof that, like feminism <br />and punk rock, the protest song is alive and high-kicking.</p> </blockquote> <p>Pussy Riot are not a band. They make a point of clearing up that popular misconception at almost every stop on their trip: They’re an arts collective that “chose the language of music” (and of punk in particular) to express themselves. But the more time I spend with them, the less I think the semantics matter. Band or not, Pussy Riot have reminded people something essential-- so simple that it’s all to easy to dismiss it as cheesy, or take it for granted-- about music’s primacy, its power to provoke, its potential to facilitate change. “It’s one of your competitive advantages,” says Hunter Heaney, founder of the nonprofit <a href="http://voiceproject.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Voice Project</a>, who has also helped <span>set up a </span><a href="http://voiceproject.org/pussyriot/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pussy Riot Support Fund</a>. “When you’re going up against whatever you’re going against-- whether it’s corporations or authoritarianism, it’s the protester, the individual, the artist who can always make better music than the other side.” </p> <p>As I watch them make their way around New York, it’s impossible not to feel grateful to live in a country where (in theory, at least) free expression is not feared, and where I won’t be sued for simply <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALS92big4TY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">linking to one of the band’s videos</a>. But most of the Americans I talk with throughout the week agree that their presence here (not to mention the unblinking gaze of Headlight’s camera) brings into focus something lacking in American music right now. For all the good that the Occupy movement did, plenty of people rightly wondered why-- unlike the countercultural movements of the 60s-- music hadn’t played a more central role. “Where’s Occupy’s Woody Guthrie?” one website wondered. Has music in the 21st century outlived its revolutionary potential? What Pussy Riot give us is a new, viral-ready model for the digital age-- proof that, like feminism and punk rock, the protest song is alive and high-kicking. </p> <p>Headlight and Puck exit New York in the same haze of mystery and privacy in which they arrived: No one will say exactly when they’re leaving, how they’re getting there, where they’ll go. Before their secret departure, I follow them to a few more events around the city that suggest something about the impossibly wide appeal of the group. At the HBO premiere, they inform a celeb-studded audience about the Russian government’s latest violation of their rights: “We do not have freedom of speech. We do not feel safe now anywhere.” At the decidedly less glitzy academic conference Left Forum, they play videos of their punk songs to an assembled crowd of progressive scholars and intellectuals. Something about it all feels elusive, powerfully contradictory, hard to pin down-- which, I’m guessing, is exactly what they want. By the end of the week, I can’t decide if I’ve been in the presence of a group of real-life superheroes, or just getting to know a couple of down-to-earth Clark Kents.</p>

</p> <p class="p1">When Pitchfork ran a career-spanning <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8031-uestlove-15-years/">interview</a> with Ahmir "<a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3503-uestlove/">?uestlove</a>" Thompson in 2011 as part of our 15th anniversary, we noted, "<span class="s2">One of these days, ?uestlove will write a memoir, and it will be incredible." </span></p> <p class="p1">Here it is two years later, and that memoir, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mo-Meta-Blues-According-Questlove/dp/1455501352" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span class="s1"><i>Mo' Meta Blues: The World According to Questlove</i></span></a>, has arrived. And it <i>is</i> incredible. It's clear that music writers have a special attraction to Thompson because he's one of the more unabashed music geeks to ever walk the earth. In the spheres of the music he loves, which is a very large sphere, he knows all the records, all the tracks, who played on what, what the sleeves looks like. He thinks like a critic and loves reflecting on songs and albums as a listener, ranking records and making lists. He's a student of music and pop culture.</p> <p class="p1">But, as the book demonstrates, Thompson is also a wonderful storyteller. <i>Mo' Meta Blues </i>covers his life from his early days in Philadelphia as a child drummer and stage manager for his parents' band to his immersion in hip-hop and the formative years of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/">the Roots</a>. His resume is daunting, endless: co-producer on D'Angelo's <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17407-voodoo/"><i>Voodoo</i></a>, binding force for the influential Soulquarians collective, musical director for "Chappelle's Show", band-leading fixture on "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon" (soon to be "The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon"), restaurateur. Along the way, there are encounters with many of his musical heroes, like the time <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/">Prince</a> donned a pair of glowing roller skates and dazzled a handful of guests at a Valentine's Day party in Los Angeles.</p> <p class="p1">We spoke at NBC Studios in Manhattan last week. When I arrived at Thompson's small office on the sixth floor of 30 Rock-- a space packed with CDs, DVDs, instruments, a TV-- he was sitting at his computer catching up on Twitter while also looking at texts on his phone. Typical multitasking. The interview took place in the NBC cafeteria, where he ate sushi and a seaweed salad for lunch before heading back to prepare for the next "Late Night" show. </p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p2">"I'm a music nerd. I grew up in a room with 300 reviews <br />staring at me from one wall. I'm obsessed with the process."</p> </blockquote> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: You were so immersed in music from an early age, playing and touring with your parents' bands. But at what point did you realize that you were going to make music your life? </b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Ahmir Thompson: I knew I was going to be a musician. I got my first real drum set at seven, a Vista Light C3 kit that John Bonham had during the <i>Physical Graffiti</i> tour-- one of my dad's drummers got strung out on drugs, and I inherited that set. At that age, I could play drums well enough for an adult to say, "Play my show." I enjoyed it. I liked to travel. I had the knowledge. Technically, I was stage manager at the age of eight.</p> <p class="p1">I should ask my dad: "Why did you teach me how to work the soundboard and place the mic settings and cut gels? Was it because you wanted me to take this path or was it to keep me off the streets?" I think his answer would be more the latter. But it kept me focused on their show, and I was educated. It prepared me. Across the street [<i>gestures out window</i>], at Radio City, when I was 12, the drummer of my father's band got injured. And my dad was confident. He just said, "You know the show. Do it." I became his bandleader at the age of 12.</p> <p class="p1">But my dad did not know about [the Roots' 1993 debut album] <i>Organix</i>. It was only midway through <i>Do You Want More?!!!??! </i>when I finally had to come clean and be like, "All right, I got a record deal and I'm in a group."</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: You were afraid to tell him? </b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>AT: Oh, hell yeah.<b> </b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b><b>Pitchfork: It wasn't the kind of music he respected?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>AT: The debut of "Yo! MTV Raps" in 1988 was probably the most revolutionary thing to happen to black music since the October '71 debut of "Soul Train". And my dad, just being a surface critic, changing channels and seeing the first four seconds of "Baby Got Back" or "Straight Outta Compton"-- it's not music to him.</p> <p class="p1">He sacrificed everything so that I could go to private school. Sometimes bills weren't paid. Sometimes gas was cut off. But my parents made sure I had the best education and drum lessons no matter what. In his head, he wanted me to follow the path of my schoolmates, who would get pulled out of class to go play with <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/" target="_blank">Miles Davis</a>. That was my dad's idea of high art. My father wanted me to be a worker, and I dreamed of being an owner.</p> <p class="p1">By the time <i>Things Fall Apart</i> came out and we had finally managed to go above the surface, he suddenly saw the light. He knew we were legit. Now, he's our biggest champion. I'm sure that <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14386-how-i-got-over/" target="_blank"><i>How I Got Over</i></a> and <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16102-the-roots-undun/" target="_blank"><i>Undun</i></a> are still in his CD changer in the car. Getting my father's approval was always like this impossible Mount Fuji mission that I just got to the top of two or three years ago. Now that he sees how I've been able to make a living at this for 20 years, at least, he says, "I'm very proud of you. You are the greatest thing that happened to me." That was the greatest thing I've ever heard in my life. </p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Your parents must have done a good job of instilling confidence in you. In the book, there are a lot of places along the way where you could have said, "Maybe it's time to do something else."</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>AT: Everyone has those insecure moments. I mean, I'm cool enough to admit it. I don't feel dweebish because I say I have to check my Metacritic rating and make sure it's still above 80 or whatever. I'm a music nerd. I grew up in a room with 300 reviews staring at me from one wall. I'm obsessed with the process. But as far as the confidence, everyone has insecurities. Kanye says he has insecurities. But being a radical doesn't hurt, [never getting] too comfortable. I've never ever been that in a moment in my life where it's like, [<i>sigh of relief</i>] "This is great." I'm always paranoid. Right now, I'm thinking about my third book. [<i>laughs</i>]</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/benwatts.jpg" alt="" /><i><small>Photo by Ben Watts</small></i></p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: One snapshot of history that I found particularly interesting was the whole Soulquarians period, where you guys were playing music in a house with Common, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, people who were just starting out and sharing ideas. What do you think when you look back at that? </b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>AT: I wish I remember enjoying that period. For me, it's a whole bowl of stress, because my house is the default house for which these events happen. It's like those John Hughes 80s films when there's 200 people in mom and dad's house-- I'm worried about my walls. I'm worried about people going through my mail. I'm worried about people lighting their cigarettes, walking on trash cans. Yeah, I'll do my obligatory two, three-hour jamming thing, but I'm also worried about noise ordinances.</p> <p class="p1">But in hindsight, that's when [Roots manager] Rich [Nichols] taught us the lesson that you get to contextualize, establish a movement. Besides the one-hit wonder, there's never ever been success in music without the contextualization of being associated with someone else. I don't think it's a coincidence that all these previous hard-to-sell, underground, ignored, not-media-savvy artists were all of a sudden selling one million, two million units during that period of 1998 to 2004: D'Angelo, us, Erykah [Badu], Common, Mos [Def] and [Talib] Kweli. I consider Kanye and Alicia [Keys] to be the steroids version, to the point where they're mainstream artists but they have a left-of-center sense mentality. And now they finish the race and are their own empire.</p> <p class="p1">But that's one of the things I'm proud of. The initial nucleus in my circle, the guys that I dubbed the Illadelphonics when I was first doing shows for Jay-Z, all of those guys have split off and now have their own bands. <a href="http://www.adamblackstone.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adam Blackstone</a> basically just runs the world now: he is [musical director for] Jay-Z, Justin [Timberlake], Selena Gomez, Ne-Yo, he runs at least 15 acts. My keyboard player Omar [Edwards] has got seven: Mary J. Blige, Rihanna, Kanye, Timbaland. Pretty much if you are at stadium status and you're touring, your band has to come through that circle. Those same frickin' 14-, 15-, 16-year-olds that used to abuse my PlayStation when I came home off tour and left my house smelling like corn chips with their socks are now running empires, which is amazing to me.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p1">"I have like nine UFO stories, which is basically <br />a story that no one's ever going to believe."</p> </blockquote> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: You have some great stories in there about Prince-- especially the roller rink party on Valentine's Day. </b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>AT: That was the coolest, safest Prince story I could tell. Ninety-five percent of the other times was us playing music, and there's no story in that. He's insanely private. I figured since he already has those boots that light up when he walks, then there's no revelation if you have a pair of roller skates that make you look like an extra in <i>Xanadu</i>!</p> <p class="p1">Here's the funniest thing about that story: Eddie Murphy's [at "Late Night"] last November to promote that movie he did with Ben Stiller, <i>Tower Heist</i>. When some real A-list stars come in, all the hallways are quiet and you can hear a pin drop. It's real tension. Usually, when the Megan Foxes of the world-- or anybody in that top half of the <i>Maxim</i> list-- are here, all of a sudden it's quiet as a mouse. Other cats, like Springsteen, just come here and pop in our room without knocking, sit down, talk to us. That's regular.</p> <p class="p1">So when Eddie was here, he was in the hallway-- and there's at least 80 people in that hallway-- and it was deadly silent. He's just standing there and it's a real awkward moment. I said, "Can I talk to him for a second?" Then: "Hey, it's such an honor for you to be here. I gotta ask you a question. I don't know if you remember, but Valenti..." And I swear I did not even get the entire word "Valentine's" out of my mouth, and he says, "roller skates!" [<i>laughs</i>] The recapping of the story was almost better than the experience, because that made me look like the coolest person at 30 Rock. All of a sudden it was just he and I in our own world, and we were laughing so hard that everyone else started laughing.</p> <p class="p1">I have like nine UFO stories, which is basically a story that no one's ever going to believe. Like if my ex wasn't with me on Valentine's Day, I would tell the story to no one, because they would just say, "You're making it up." It was like [Eddie] and I were Vietnam veterans or something, like we were in the same platoon. I was like, "Yo, man, do you realize how hard it is to get people to believe that story? How many times I've had to call my ex to verify that, like, 'Yes, we were there. And, yes, Prince had on the roller skates.'"</p> <p class="p1">Eddie added to the story. Everyone pretty much knows that Prince's Jehovah's Witness conviction is strong. So at one point, Eddie says that Prince [skated] past him going backwards and said [<i>making the two-fingers-across-eyes Prince sign</i>], "When are you going to give your life to Jehovah, Eddie Murphy?" [<i>laughs</i>] </p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: And Prince was just a figure of grace in those skates, right?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>AT: Amazing. I heard he has a near-200 bowling game, too. Prince let us take over Paisley Park for about two weeks-- he gave Common free use of the studio while he was on the road. It was the most surreal thing. There's so many gnomes and busts and over-the-top illustrations of his face alone. And I swear to God, if you're walking in the dark and there's white walls with black paintings, it's like the eyes are following you. There was a point where I was feeling the wall to see if there were hidden cameras.</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/finz.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: You've had a chance to work with a lot of people who you grew up idolizing. Was there a point along the way when you became unfazed by that?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>AT: Well, I had one regret about this book coming out so soon-- the lesson that I learned doing Al Green's <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11515-lay-it-down/"><i>Lay It Down</i></a> record. He's an eccentric genius, and I think that if you are this supremely gifted artist, then there will checks and balances-- something else will be missing.</p> <p class="p1">So there's this point where my whole thing was to go kind of nouveau retro and take him back to a more natural, soulful place, closer to Willie Mitchell, below the Mason-Dixon Line kind of thing. And we had a really good groove going for the first three months of creating and writing the music. Then Al gets on this tangent, he says, "Stevie wrote us a song." Instantly, I'm like, "Even if I were to do a Stevie Wonder song, it's not gonna sound like it's a Memphis song. There's a certain groove we have. This record's coherent this way and now you're talking about a Stevie Wonder song?" He said, "Yeah, man! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42VviZ1EvKs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stevie Wonder's 'I Love You Too Much'</a>-- that was my song!" Now I'm thinking, "Wait a minute! That's the second song on <i>In Square Circle</i>, from 1985. I don't wanna cover that song! That song has nothing to do with what we're doing texture-wise." We kinda shrugged it off. Then later, we needed a cover song. [Al said], "Hey! I've got a cover song! Stevie Wonder wrote me a song called 'I Love You Too Much'." And I said, "Yeah, we know, we know!" So I think, "Well, we can try it out and he'll forget about it." And he forgets about it.</p> <p class="p1">Three months later, we've got 10 songs. [Al says], "What about Stevie? I wanna do that." Basically, Al became the little boy that cried "I Love You Too Much". For three years, from 2003 to early 2006, that's all he kept talking about, to the point where it just became the running joke behind his back. [<i>The cover did not end up on </i>Lay It Down.]</p> <p class="p1">Now, cut to like two months ago. A friend of mine [who works at a label] gets a call from a storage facility in Philadelphia that alerts him to the fact that payments on a storage unit are long overdue and that they're gonna shut it down and trash all these reels they had in there. And there's a lot of reels! They said, "We know that some of these artists are on your label, so you might want to see about this." And they run off names like Bowie and Stevie Wonder. So I tell my friend, like, "Yeah, send the Stevie reel." There are seven songs on there, and the date on one of the songs is September 11, 1977. It's a duet with Al Green-- "I Love You Too Much"! And this shit sounded like a Memphis song! I call Rich up, I'm like, "Yo! He was telling the truth!" Oh, man! I was so sick, like, all the time we was clowning him about this non-existent thing: "<i>Suuuure</i> you did a song with Stevie."</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Are there other music memoirs that inspired you for this book?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>AT: The two I loved the most also broke my heart the most. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/030681191X" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye </i></a>was extremely haunting. And Brian Wilson's book [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wouldnt-Nice-My-Own-Story/dp/0747531455/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371145592&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Wouldn%27t+It+Be+Nice" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Wouldn't It Be Nice</i></a>] was really heartbreaking.

It's one thing when you write it and email stuff in and they send you the drafts back with corrections and all that stuff. But then I'm reading it and I'm almost at the end. For a few moments, I actually kinda read it third-person. I was like, "OK. This guy is interesting."</p>

This time, we spoke with bassist extraordinare <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/">Thundercat</a>, aka Stephen Bruner, whose new album </i><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18156-thundercat-apocalypse/">Apocalypse</a><i> is out now.</i></p> <hr /> <p class="p1"><b>You're riding in the car with your parents...</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>Driving around with my dad growing up, he would play everything: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Bailey" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Philip Bailey</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manhattan_Transfer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Manhattan Transfer</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/4742-frank-zappa/">Frank Zappa</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/23522-cream/">Cream</a>. I'd be like, “Dad, cut this stuff off!” And he’d say, “No, you’re gonna listen to it.” I didn't understand why he liked it so much. In my mind, I would be thinking about the theme song to "Sonic the Hedgehog". But that's how he introduced me to <a href="http://www.jacopastorius.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jaco Pastorius</a>. The day I finally was like, “I love this song!” he just started laughing and said, “I got you!” He put on "Portrait of Tracy" and I put the video game down.</p> <p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/soB44fxk8uU?rel=0" width="624" height="468" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1"><b>You're hosting a dinner party...</b></p> <p class="p2">When I invite people over to my apartment, they usually don’t like it because the music I play confuses the crap out of them-- I’m making people listen to the "Final Fantasy" soundtrack and they’re like, “Why is this happening? Let’s just leave and find somebody who wants us to have fun and not teach us about something.” Sometimes I try to do what my dad did to me in the car-- but in a very twisted way. It usually doesn’t work out.</p> <p class="p2">But listening to a song you heard as a kid later on as an adult can put it in a different light. People will be like, “Is that 'Sonic the Hedgehog?' I used to love that game!” They’ll be listening to the song without the game and be like, “Dang, this is some serious, well-put-together music." Then they'll ask for the album, and I’m like, “No, you go get it yourself.” I spent 20 years looking for the "Sonic the Hedgehog" album. </p> <p class="p2"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UEannNh8ihA?rel=0" width="624" height="468" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1"><b>You're running on a treadmill at the gym...</b></p> <p class="p1">I would listen to something really, really stupid, like "Living Inside Myself" by Gino Vannelli, because I think running is stupid. [<i>laughs</i>] Reading and exercising are two things in life that are not necessary. They're kind of like telephone poles at this point-- they're just there to scare the shit out of us. We should just start hanging really cool lanterns from telephone poles.</p> <p><iframe src="http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x1958x" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p2"><b>You're playing along to something while practicing bass...</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>Sometimes I practice to <a href="http://www.therealallanholdsworth.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Allan Holdsworth</a> or <a href="http://www.johnmclaughlin.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">John McLaughlin</a>, but I don’t just practice to jazz and jazz-fusion albums. I’ll practice to TV theme music-- one of my favorites is "M*A*S*H". I'll just play along with anything on the TV. It's like multi-tasking, but nothing's actually getting accomplished: I’m staring at the TV, so I’m not paying attention to the instrument. But then I’ll be playing what’s on TV, so I’m not paying attention to the show. </p> <p><iframe src="http://media.mtvnservices.com/embed/mgid:cms:video:tvland.com:21655" width="624" height="351" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p1"><b>It's four in the morning and you can't fall asleep...</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>I'm a heavy sleeper, and every once in awhile, I have that fear of waking up to someone in my house staring at me, masturbating, with a bag over their head. [<i>laughs</i>] But then I remember that will probably not happen. But if I was awake in the middle of the night, I'd probably listen to <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/2647-mahavishnu-orchestra/">Mahavishnu Orchestra</a>. Growing up, that was something that would make me think-- I would always try to understand different parts of what was going on in the music. I still do that.

</span></p> <p dir="ltr">John Withers is a uncannily modern figure. Hailing from Cape Town, South Africa, the 25-year-old is an internet-raised musical sponge, taking in a startling range of global styles-- dub reggae, R&amp;B, classical, jazz, high-speed African dance music, electro-pop, tropicalia, folk, Congolese rumba, Mali meditative music-- and distilling them into his self-titled debut album as <a href="http://www.planet.mu/artists/johnwizards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">John Wizards</a>, out this September via <a href="http://www.planet.mu/artists/johnwizards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Planet Mu</a>. Armed with a guitar, a condenser microphone, and a few computer programs, Withers composed and recorded the album in his bedroom over the course of two years, working around the schedule of the noisy club next door. The record is spacious, joyous, and wholly refreshing, with the disparate tracks and genres segueing into each other with the unencumbered flow of a swift and clear waterway.</p> <p dir="ltr">Though Withers has since formed a live John Wizards band for local shows, he's responsible for nearly every sound on the album. He shares vocal duties throughout with Rwandan vocalist Emmanuel Nzaramba, who sings in his native Kinyarwanda language on the wobbling single "Lusaka by Night". The pairing also symbolizes a racial progressiveness for South Africa, a country still dealing with the lingering effects of apartheid two decades after its dissolution. On this point, Withers is hopeful, but realistic. "Centuries of segregation and oppression will definitely take a while to change," he says. "It’s a very slow process."</p> <p dir="ltr">Another only-in-2013 occurrence: Among the current artists he's into, Withers mentions <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/">Vampire Weekend</a>, which means that, in just a few years, the New York City band has evolved from so-called pilferers of South African culture to influencing at least one actual South African band. "If you're white and playing an African style, even in Africa, it’s a touchy thing," says Withers. "But I’ve got no real problem with people drawing on anything-- if the music is nice, the music is nice." Thus far, he's met no resistance when it comes to his own attempts at incorporating traditionally black sounds into his own music.</p> <p dir="ltr"> <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="300" height="24" id="player-7484" name="player1"> <param name="movie" value="http://cdn.pitchfork.com/streaming-player/player.swf"> <param name="allowfullscreen" value="false"> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"> <param name="flashvars" value="file=Jamieo.mp3&title=&quot;Jamieo&quot;&lightcolor=EF4135&streamer=rtmp://s3w1mu85xbnhjc.cloudfront.net/cfx/st"> <embed id="player-7484" name="player-7484" src="http://cdn.pitchfork.com/streaming-player/player.swf" width="300" height="24" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="false" flashvars="file=Jamieo.mp3&title=&quot;Jamieo&quot;&lightcolor=EF4135&streamer=rtmp://s3w1mu85xbnhjc.cloudfront.net/cfx/st" />

</p> <p dir="ltr">Withers is currently paying his rent for an apartment near Cape Town's City Hall by making music for TV commercials, putting him in a unique position in the current discussion about where music ends and commerce begins, too. The son of an ad man, he grew up playing classical piano, before switching to guitar, and then studying art history at university.</p> <p dir="ltr">His post-collegiate life has been marked by a series of trips and adventures around southern Africa that work in communion with his music. Several songs on <i>John Wizards</i> take their names from these locales, like "Muizenberg" (a beachside Cape Town suburb), "Limpopo" (the northernmost South African province), "Lushoto" (near the east coast of Tanzania), and the storied South African village of <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/atop-a-mountain-south-africas-ghosts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hogsback</a>. "When I’m naming songs, it’s not so much about anything to do with the place specifically, but more the feeling that the place gives," he says. "I write the song and it reminds me of something-- <span id="docs-internal-guid-4ce17f68-33ec-8909-6456-c188a0a43938"><span>the experience of being somewhere foreign is very exciting for me.</span></span>" With his music, Withers is passing those feelings on. His album is imbued with a post-tourist mindset where sounds whiz by like scenery from a train window but also make enough of an impression to stick with you once you're back home.</p> <p><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/JohnWizardsALBUMART624.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p><b>Pitchfork: This album really exists in its own musical universe. Were you an imaginative kid growing up?</b></p> <p class="p1">John Withers: I think so. I had a reputation for being a bit daydream-y in high school. When we'd play cricket, I would just stand in the field and think about other things. One teacher would always shout at me and make a play off my surname: “Withers, are you with us?”</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: How did you meet the Rwandan singer on the album, Emmanuel?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>JW: There’s a coffee shop I used to like going to, and he looked after the cars there. One day, he started speaking to me about music and said he’d come to South Africa to be a musician and asked if I could record him. So we did a recording, and then he disappeared for a year. He’s quite hard to contact. I ran into him again when I was living in a different place in the city last year, and it turned out he lived on the same street. So I showed him some of the stuff that I’d been doing, and he grabbed a mic and started to sing.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: The idea of musical appropriation can be a touchy subject, do a lot of bands in Cape Town have both white and black members?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>JW: It doesn’t happen much. There isn't very much of a meeting of cultures in that way. It should happen more. But again, it’s sensitive-- you don’t want to use an African singer just because you want something to have an African vibe.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Were you wary of people seeing your collaboration with Emmanuel in that light?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>JW: It concerned me, but I really liked how it was sounding. So once I had a little bit of positive affirmation from other people, that concern diminished.</p> <p class="p1"><img src="http://pitchfork-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/content/wizardz.jpg" alt="" /><i><small>From left: Geoff Brink, Tom Parker, John Withers, Alex Montgomery, Emmanuel Nzaramba, Raphael Segerman</small></i></p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: You're currently working in a music studio, making music for TV ads. Is that fun for you?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>JW: It can be very fun. The second half of the album track "Finally/Jet Up" evolved out of an ad that I was working on. But there are also ads where you have to just get through it, too.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: What’s the most ridiculous jingle you've had to come up with?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>JW: I did this one for a petrol company-- I had to do a take off of a Woody Guthrie song and make car noises with my mouth.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Is it important for you to keep a distance between the music you make for ads and the music you make for yourself?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>JW: There's that impulse to separate yourself between being very creative and very practical, but I don’t think it has to be that necessarily. Sometimes I find myself listening to stuff I’ve done for ads over and over again because I actually really like the idea, but it’s not quite the thing I’d want to put out into the world.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you’re trying to emulate another band’s sound when you’re making these commercials?</b></p> <p class="p1"><b></b>JW: You have to. Sometimes, that’s exactly what the client wants because they don’t have enough money for the actual track, so you have to try and get it as close as possible without actually writing the same song. You get band references when you're given jobs-- Beach House is one of the bands that pops up a lot. With that kind of work, though, part of me switches off because it seems very easy.</p> <p class="p1"><b>Pitchfork: What if someone came to you a year from now and wanted a commercial to sound like John Wizards. Would you be OK with that?</b></p> <p class="p3">JW: Maybe I’d feel flattered. I'm not sure. Ask me when it happens-- I don’t know if it will.</p>

</p> <p class="p1"><i><small>Photo by Rick Bahto</small></i></p> <p class="p1"><a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/">Julia Holter</a>’s debut album <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15932-julia-holter/"><span class="s1"><i>Tragedy</i></span></a><i> </i>was based on the work of ancient Athenian playwright Euripides. Its follow-up, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16352-ekstasis/"><span class="s1"><i>Ekstasis</i></span></a><i>,</i> was informed by an advanced syllabus of Greek classicism and great American poetry.<i> </i>But for her third LP, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/50840-julia-holter-announces-new-album-loud-city-song-shares-new-track-world/"><span class="s1"><i>Loud City Song</i></span></a><i>, </i>due out August 20 on Domino,<i> </i>the 28-year-old explores a more contemporary mindset; the album draws parallels between the title character in Colette’s 1944 novella <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Gigi </i></a>and L.A.'s modern celebrity-soaked culture. "It's about someone trying to find love and truth in a superficial society," says Holter.</p> <p class="p1">Given her anachronistic bent, hearing the singer/songwriter steam about reality television (“I don’t understand why people enjoy it, I find it to be really boring and depressing”) is a surprise. But <i>Loud City Song</i> finds Holter stepping outside of herself, working with co-producer (and former member of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/">Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti</a>) Cole M. Greif-Neill, as well as a host of outside musicians, giving the album a more expansive feel. "It was great having an actual trombone do something that I never would have been able to do on my Casio," she says. While Holter can speak about her own music with both nonchalant confidence and frustrating secrecy, she’s more open about the ideas of status and how Los Angeles can make someone feel invisible.</p> <p class="p1">On the album's hushed, cathedral-ready opener "World", she sings, "All the hats of the world/ I don't know how I wear a hat so much/ Even when I run/ The city can't see my eyes/ Under the brim." And when we meet in an bookstore-themed coffee shop in Echo Park, she's topped in a large, floppy number her mother acquired in Mexico in the 70s. "In L.A., it's like everyone's invisible," she says. "That's why I like it here."</p> <p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BmT7GKPsxto?rel=0" width="624" height="468" frameborder="0"></iframe></p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: How much of <i>Loud City Song</i> is autobiographical or specifically about Los Angeles?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>Julia Holter: It’s somewhat of a coming-of-age story. It starts with that central choice of whether to run out in the wild and be free of others, or to be one with the city and embrace it and laugh at it at the same time. All the songs came out of that question, and each one is about this person investigating different approaches. It's also themed around the loudness of society: media, gossip, celebrity obsession.</p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: Do you think the allusions to Greek literature and your CalArts background make people exaggerate the “academic” part of your music?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>JH: I did go to school for music, but I don’t think you <i>have</i> to. I don’t think I had to either. I don’t have an issue if people are going to position me one way or another, they should just listen to the music and form whatever opinion of me they want to. I don’t care if musicians or poets are assholes, I don’t care what their personalities are like. If they make stuff I like, that’s what it’s all about. Just listen to the music.</p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: This is your first album recorded in a professional environment as opposed to your bedroom, but would you say those early experiences were necessary to prepare you for this record?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>JH: Yeah, it was really important for me, because I was able to explore all these things that I wouldn’t have had the guts to do otherwise. I was a very fearful person. I felt restricted and was questioning myself all the time, but being able to just let myself sing gibberish and consider what I can do with it allowed me to take myself seriously. I still record a lot in my bedroom, and I’d be happy to record another record in my bedroom, too.</p> <blockquote class="pull"> <p class="p2">"I don’t care if musicians are assholes. <br />If they make stuff I like, that’s what it’s all about."</p> </blockquote> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: How did <i>Ekstasis </i>translate from your bedroom to venues where you were <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/46710-perfume-genius-julia-holter-to-open-for-sigur-ros/">opening for Sigur Rós</a>? </b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>JH: It was really fun playing those huge rooms. A lot of it has to do with having a really nice sound system and professional people; it’s actually nicer than having five people in a brightly-lit room sometimes. That bothers me more. And the Sigur Rós guys were really cool. It could have been awful if it was a crowd that didn’t want anything that they had to listen to carefully. </p> <p class="p2"><b>Pitchfork: Do you find bigger shows troublesome considering your music is often quiet and demands total attention?</b></p> <p class="p2"><b></b>JH: I believe in the audience doing whatever they want... except hurting me physically. Maybe I would feel sad if everyone hated it, but I don’t believe it’s my job to care about what the audience is feeling. I don’t really care if they’re talking. They should have the freedom to visibly dislike something if they want to.</p>

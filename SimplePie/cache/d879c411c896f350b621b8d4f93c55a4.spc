It found that Americans are concerned about the lack of jobs (26% cited this as the most important economic issue), the budget deficit (17%), and the rising cost of health care (18%) and education (9%). Overall, they are pessimistic about what the future holds. A majority (54%) believes that hard work and determination are no guarantee of success and, perhaps more alarming, a majority (52%) also believes their generation is better off financially than the next generation will be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Perceptions of economic mobility by generation.  Is my generation worse off than my parents, and/or better off than my children will be?" src="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2013/07/18 economic values survey capitalism government prri dionne galston/economic_mobility.jpg" /></p>
<p>Despite these negative views of the economy and financial well-being, most Americans (54%) nonetheless believe that capitalism is working at least somewhat well. They don&rsquo;t feel the same way about government, however. While more than 6-in-10 Americans agree that government should do more to reduce the gap between rich and poor, and that it is the responsibility of government to take care of those who cannot take care of themselves, roughly two-thirds say the federal government is broken.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Survey respondents on why capitalism is or is not working" src="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2013/07/18 economic values survey capitalism government prri dionne galston/capitalism_working.jpg" /></p>
<p>Yet the survey found some hopeful signs. Although polarization persists in many areas, there is broad consensus on the values that should guide the government&rsquo;s economic policy. Approximately 8-in-10 Americans agree that promoting freedom and liberty, encouraging people to live more responsible lives, and promoting equality and fairness are important guiding values. More than two-thirds cite promoting a public safety net as an important guide.</p>
<p>The survey also developed a new religious orientation scale in order to explore differences and similarities among Americans of faith and to better understand the constituencies that make up the political parties. Among Republicans, most (56%) are religious conservatives and few (6%) are nonreligious; among Democrats, a larger portion (17%) is nonreligious, but a plurality identify as religious moderates (42%).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, religious progressives and religious conservatives hold different views about what being a religious person means. Nearly 8-in-10 religious progressives say being a religious person is mostly about doing the right thing, whereas a majority (54%) of religious conservatives says it is primarily about having the right beliefs. They disagree about whether belief in God is necessary in order to be moral and have good values: about three-quarters of religious conservatives think belief in God is a necessary prerequisite, whereas almost as many religious liberals (70%) think one can be moral without believing in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="500" height="844" alt="Whether survey respondents agree with the statement that it is necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values, by demographic" src="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2013/07/18 economic values survey capitalism government prri dionne galston/moral_values2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Members of these groups are also at odds about the degree to which social problems stem from individual actions and decisions. More than 8-in-10 religious conservatives agree that if enough people had a personal relationship with God, social problems would take care of themselves, but nearly 7-in-10 religious progressives disagree with that statement.</p>
<p><em>The survey was designed and conducted by Public Religion Research Institute in partnership with the Brookings Institution. Results of the survey were based on bilingual (Spanish and English) telephone interviews conducted between May 30, 2013 and June 16, 2013, among a random sample of 2,002 adults in the entire United States (800 respondents were interviewed on a cell phone).</em></p><h4>

<p>When Edward Snowden, a Booz Allen contractor at the National Security Agency, leaked details of programs to collect telephone metadata and (under a program called PRISM) mass Internet data, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said the leaks had caused &ldquo;long-lasting and irreversible damage to U.S. national security.&rdquo;</p>

James Cartwright is under investigation for alleged leaks about the so-called Operation Olympic Games, in which a computer worm famously known as Stuxnet  was used to attack the Iranian uranium enrichment program. Jane Harman, former Democratic congresswoman and House Intelligence Committee chairwoman, now CEO of the Wilson Center, said, "I think [the leak] had devastating consequences.&rdquo;</p>

	<img src="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/images/k/ka%20ke/kenya_mombasa001/kenya_mombasa001_16x9.jpg?w=120" alt="People play a boardgame on a street in the Mishomoroni area of Kenya's coastal city of Mombasa March 5, 2013" border="0" /><br /><p>First came <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2013/03/12-mobile-money-chandy" target="_blank">M-Pesa</a>, the now famous mobile phone money transfer system in Kenya, which has made it possible for millions to access the life-changing financial services previously not available to them. </p>
<p>Now there is Bangla-Pesa, a complementary currency that has become a medium of exchange in the Bangladesh slum in the city of Mombasa. Bangla-Pesa&mdash;appropriately named as it is only accepted within the confines of this particular slum&mdash; is a voucher that traders and service providers are using to do business. Unlike vouchers that are used for a particular good or service, Bangla-Pesa coupons are accepted for many transactions and therefore represent a complementary currency acting as a means of exchange in the slum. For this slum, Bangla-pesa operates alongside the official government issued currency.</p>
<p>One feature of slum economies is business volatility. Sometimes within a month, businesses are booming and demand for goods and services is high. This could, for example, coincide with times when workers receive their wages. &nbsp;However, good times are often followed by downturns within the same month, where economic activity quickly slows down. A survey conducted in the Bangladesh slum in Mombasa found that many residents were not able to get basic necessities during periods of business downturns. </p>
<p>Consider a bicycle operator who provides transportation services in the slum. He can make enough income for sustenance if he makes 20 trips a day.&nbsp;However, during the slow periods of the month, demand for his services might be only 10 trips a day. Thus, he won&rsquo;t make enough money to buy groceries and put food on the table. In the same slum, there is a grocer facing similar problems of low sales, and she needs transportation services to get around the slum. Yet, both slum traders don&rsquo;t do enough business during the slow periods and therefore have to go without certain goods and services during these times. </p>
<p>But now introduce Bangla-Pesa (BP), vouchers with designated values, into the slum.&nbsp;Businesses that are members of the Bangla Business Network enroll in the program, which distributes an equal number of vouchers to each member. In addition, all the members agree to honor the vouchers as means of exchange. &nbsp;Now when all or some of the traders experience downturns in their business, they can make business transactions among themselves with Bangla-Pesa. Given that the bicycle operator needs to purchase some groceries, he will give the grocer BPs (amount depending on quantity of groceries). The grocer accepts the BP vouchers and gives him the groceries he needs. When the grocer needs to get somewhere via bike, she can go to the bicycle operator (who is also a member of the Bangla Business Network) and take a ride using her BPs. The transactions do not have to take place simultaneously. This is not a barter trade system because the vouchers are used to make transactions for many goods and services among all members of the business network. As a result, the traders in this slum are able to engage in a whole range of transactions using Bangla-Pesa. </p>
<p>The Bangla-Pesa program aims at cushioning residents against falling below the poverty line during periods when business slow and poor. The program also aims at stimulating the local economy and assists its members in trading their excess capacity. The idea is that this will increase overall efficiency in the market. The program therefore seeks to create an avenue for the poor to enhance their participation in a market economy. It should provide a means for the poor to purchase goods and services from the market even without normal currency.</p>
<p>The Bangla-Pesa program seeks to cushion the poor whose flow of money is often limited and sporadic. It is only used within the membership network and serves as a mutual-credit clearing (or multilateral reciprocal exchange). It is described as credit since traders receive goods and services without paying any cash (they only present the coupons). </p>
<p><a href="http://koru.or.ke/bangla-pesa-survery" target="_blank">A survey of the impact of the Bangla-Pesa program</a> reports impressive results. Around 83 percent of participants in the program reported that their total sales were increasing as a result of the vouchers with only 0.05 percent reporting a decline in sales. Average daily sales through Bangla-Pesa represent 22 percent of the total daily sales reported by businesses from the baseline level. However, daily sales reported through Kenyan shillings have not changed from the baseline level. This suggests that the 22 percent of daily trades conducted with Bangla-Pesa represents additional sales which might not have happened without the program. Overall, the use of the complementary currency appears to expand market exchanges in the slum. </p>
<p>It is often claimed that complementary currencies strengthen community spirit, increases community participation in social and economic activities, reduce imports into the community, and lead to improved quality of life. The evidence from the survey seems to suggest that this program is having a positive impact on participants.<ins datetime="2013-07-16T08:02" cite="mailto:mkimenyi"></ins></p>
<p>A quick review shows that complementary currencies are a growing phenomenon in developing countries. It does appear that such complementary currencies help ease indentified constraints facing poor people. But questions about the broader implications of using a complementary currency such as Bangla-Pesa remain unanswered. For example, could such use of a localized currency weaken linkages with other communities and the larger economy? What might be the impact on the economy if many other slums in country or city adopt their own complementary currencies?&nbsp; Is this a program that should be restricted or regulated? &nbsp;Is it a case of &ldquo;bad money&rdquo; driving &ldquo;good money&rdquo; out? These are questions that researchers should explore before complementary currency programs explode in Kenya and other developing countries.</p><div>

Everything that followed is a footnote. There is nothing to celebrate here. The man who killed him is acquitted, although he behaved badly, ignored what the police told him, and appears to have been motivated by racial stereotypes if not racial hatred. He may also, in fact, have committed murder in the second degree or manslaughter, but he will not serve time if he has. Yet his trial and the verdict are not without their virtues.     </p>
<p>Chief among them is that legal justice has been done. It is easy to construct scenarios consistent with a guilty George Zimmerman. We have only Zimmerman’s word that Trayvon Martin turned on him or ambushed him, yet he refused to tell this tale under oath. Zimmerman’s claim that Martin pounded his head violently and repeatedly against the pavement such that he feared for his life seems inconsistent with the few bumps and scrapes on his head and the absence of any trace of his DNA on Martin’s fingernails, hands or body. If Martin was pounding Zimmerman’s head, he wasn’t aggressive enough to prevent Zimmerman from retrieving his gun and precisely, or with great luck, aiming it directly at Martin’s heart. The defense’s strongest evidence, testimony that Martin was on top of Zimmerman as they struggled, tells little of moment, even if it is accurate. Consider. You turn to confront a man who has been following you and is closing in. You see him reaching for a gun. You lunge at him to stop him from getting it, and your weight pushes him to the ground with you on top. Your position on top as you struggle does not mean you are the aggressor. </p>
<p>But this is all speculation. People cannot and should not be convicted on speculation. The evidence proving George Zimmerman guilty of murder or manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt wasn’t there, and it doesn’t matter that it wasn’t there because George Zimmerman never took the stand or because there were no eye witnesses or for any other reason. George Zimmerman was not proven guilty of either murder or manslaughter, and the jury, after some deliberation, reached the right result. If there is anything to celebrate about the trial, this is it. The system worked.</p>
<p>Some might argue, as Alan Dershowitz has, that the system did not work; that the case should not have been tried in the first place, and that George Zimmerman was punished by the process regardless of the outcome. Zimmerman certainly suffered from the process, as any acquitted criminal defendant does, and Dershowitz has a point, but I disagree. By the standards of cases prosecutors regularly bring, this is far from the worst in terms of evidential strength and the likelihood of conviction (Half the jury voted to convict on the first ballot). The state could not know how Martin’s girlfriend, their lead witness, would appear on the stand, nor the quality of Zimmerman’s defense. Moreover, the prosecution did not anticipate that on the eve of trial their potentially most persuasive evidence, the forensic testimony that it was Martin who was calling for help just before the shot was fired, would be barred by the judge. Although this decision too appears correct, prosecutors have often been allowed to present shaky forensic evidence. </p>
<p>If in retrospect the verdict acquitting Zimmerman was correct, the decision to try Zimmerman also had substantial virtues. The initial outrage when Florida’s stand your ground law was invoked to set Zimmerman free with no trial and minimal investigation was more than justified. Absolving Zimmerman of responsibility at that point would have meant that when a person killed another with ambiguous forensic evidence and no witnesses about, the killer’s story of what happened, coupled with consistent but minor and possibly self-inflicted injuries, would be enough to allow the killer to go free. The trial not only dampened outrage triggered by a half-hearted police investigation and a local prosecutor’s overly quick willingness to absolve Zimmerman, but the weaknesses in the evidence the state mustered have dampened outrage at seeing Zimmerman walk, even among those who still believe him guilty. The case no longer represents a Southern state’s refusal to take the killing of a black youth seriously, which is what it stood for when the news first broke. Even if there are some who do not accept the verdict, trying Zimmerman<a name="_GoBack"></a> served enhanced legitimacy.  </p>
<p>The trial also highlights a fundamental flaw in stand your ground laws. If there was not enough evidence to prove Zimmerman guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, there was also insufficient evidence to prove him innocent. That an unjustified homicide was not proved does not mean the homicide was justified. The case turned, as criminal cases often do, on the allocation of the burden of proof, an allocation that the defense emphasized in its closing argument. On the facts as we know them either Zimmerman or Martin could have been the first aggressor. Hence under Florida’s stand your ground law, it is possible that both Zimmerman and Martin could reasonably claim to have been standing their ground in that each honestly and reasonably felt his space and person was being invaded by the other in a way that constituted an attack.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> If Zimmerman had a legal right to follow Martin as he walked home, Martin had a legal right to confront Zimmerman and to tell him to go away. If a fight ensued in which each party attacked the other, the law appears to authorize each to use force, including deadly force, to prevent the assault the other. Had Martin managed to seize Zimmerman’s gun in the struggle and shot him, Martin would have been the person seeking exoneration because he had stood his ground. It is hard to come up with any policy justification for a law which not only authorizes either of two fighters to use deadly violence but also encourages it by overturning prior law that imposed a duty to retreat if retreat was possible. To the extent “stand your ground” protects a deserved right of self-defense, the law of self-defense is, as we saw in Zimmerman’s trial, more than adequate.</p>
<p>The trial may also have had important educational and deterrence functions.  Future George Zimmermans will most likely be more prone to listen to 911 operators who suggest they back off from following someone they regard as suspicious and wait for the police to arrive, and gun toters in altercations may be less likely to think stand your ground laws will protect them if they pull out their guns and fire. Trayvon Martin’s death may well mean that others will live, but no one who owes his life to Martin and to the decision to try Zimmerman will ever know. </p>

</noindex></p>
<p>When it comes to race, however, the trial did little to advance conversation. Both the prosecution and the defense tip-toed around the race issue, and some of their comments seemed to deny its existence. As a defense strategy this is understandable; acknowledging the possibility that Zimmerman was motivated by racial prejudice and racial stereotyping would have made the second degree murder charge more plausible and reduced the likelihood of juror identification with Zimmerman. The prosecution most likely had its own goals.  Chief among them, I expect, was to prevent the stoking of racial tensions and to minimize the likelihood of violent reactions to the verdict. These aims are understandable, but had the prosecution’s evidence been stronger the concern for extra-trial consequences might have cost them the verdict they sought.  As the audience, however, we should not ignore race.  It is unlikely that Martin would have been followed, much less killed, had he been white.  Zimmerman did not use the N word in talking about the boy he was following or unprompted refer to his race, but he made it clear that he profiled Martin as a useless punk. </p>
<p>Some commentators have tried to defuse racial motivation claims by suggesting that it was Martin’s hoodie rather than his race that caught Zimmerman’s attention and led to his rant. If true, an interesting lesson about contemporary racism can be drawn. We should ask why wearing a hoodie aroused Zimmerman’s suspicion. I expect it is because Zimmerman and others associate hoodies with black youth and see them as the outfit of black gang members. In these imaginations it doesn’t matter that enough hooded sweatshirts have been sold to garb every black gang member hundreds of times over. If the apologists for Zimmerman are to be believed, the association of hoodies with race and violence is so strong even a white youth wearing one would be regarded with suspicion.  Often today, racial disadvantage works this way.  People unknowingly react to race in ways that disadvantage blacks. With no awareness of what they are doing, employers don’t call the woman with a “black name” on her resume for a job interview but interview a white with identical credentials, or they don’t hire a black man who was charged with possessing marihuana and acquitted, but they “give a second chance” to a white man who pled guilty to possession. Real estate agents encourage the white sounding voice on the phone to come look at a rental unit even though the apartment doesn’t have everything they seek, but they tell the black voice that their preferences mean the apartment is not suitable. Police in training shoot more quickly when a black figure makes a possibly hostile movement than when a white figure does the same. Only controlled tests or statistics reveal how race affects the behavior of some, but the same measures reveal that others behave consistently and without discrimination regardless of race. This means that outside of controlled tests, like “race audits,” one seldom knows whether race has played a role in a job hunt failure or the unexpected renting of an apartment a black couple was interested in.  When race effects are inconsistent and subtle and when both the discriminator and the victim have difficulty perceiving the role that race is playing in decisions, it is difficult to eradicate the systematic disadvantages that plague racial minorities. Yet unless society changes to eliminate the hidden vestiges of past racism, the price paid will include more dead Trayvon Martins. </p>
<p>George Zimmerman’s legal troubles are not entirely over. Some are pressuring the Justice Department to charge him with hate crime or other civil rights violations. This would be a mistake. Many would see federal charges as excessive and illegitimate, and some would attribute prosecution to the fact that the President and his Attorney General are black. But even if these perceptions would not exist, federal criminal law should not be invoked. There is always cause for unease when following an acquittal different laws are invoked to punish a person for the behavior evaluated in the first trial. If the evidence was insufficient to justify culpability, the government, even another government invoking different laws, should not get another bite at the apple. An exception for crimes of racial violence is justified when an acquittal appears to have been against the weight of the evidence and motivated by the biases of a local court and/or jury. That is not the case here. The Florida trial was fair, and the judge and jury seemed impartial. The evidence needed to convict was simply not there. Unless persuasive new evidence that Zimmerman committed a crime is uncovered (e.g., Zimmerman brags that he got away with murder) the federal government should let the matter drop.  The same is not necessarily true of Martin’s family. They could bring a civil suit, in which the burden of proof would be less than in a criminal case, and Zimmerman would have to testify. A suit by Martin’s parents has more to commend it, both in its prospects for success and for what it could do to flesh out the picture of what happened. But a civil jury too might find for Zimmerman, and if Zimmerman is likely to leave a civil suit with his image somewhat sullied, the same will be true of Trayvon Martin.  His parents would be wise to avoid the pain of a legally sanctioned assault on their dead son’s character. Best to leave what is in the past past and to concentrate on making things better in the future. The place to begin making things better is with the repeal of Florida’s stand your ground law. </p>

" border="0" /><br /><p>These days, President Obama&rsquo;s foreign policy has come in for a lot of sharp criticism&mdash;and not just from his political enemies.  Now, even his supporters are struggling to defend his puzzling policies toward the civil war in Syria (are we arming the rebels or not?) and the recent military upheaval in Egypt (is it a coup and do we cut off U.S. aid, or not?).  Also, what is Obama&rsquo;s policy toward Iran?  Are we waiting to see whether we can negotiate a sensible compromise on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program with the new president, who seems to be so much more accommodating than his predecessor, or are we preparing for an American, or an Israeli, military assault?</p>
<p>So many questions, so few answers.  Indeed, often there are no answers&mdash;just an odd silence from the White House, when clearly there should be an explanation of the president&rsquo;s overall strategy not just to the American people, but to America&rsquo;s allies as well.  Obviously, the president is being exceedingly cautious about his next steps in the turbulent Middle East.  What is the best strategy for the U.S.?  What makes the most sense?</p>
<p>Maybe this should be the time for another &ldquo;solarium seminar&rdquo; on American foreign policy.  Let me explain.</p>
<p>During the 1952 presidential campaign, the Republican candidate, Dwight D. Eisenhower, a wartime hero, ridiculed President Harry Truman&rsquo;s sensible, if cautious, policy of the &ldquo;containment&rdquo; of Soviet expansionism.  Ike said he had a better idea.  Encouraged by his advisers, he projected a new tough line toward Moscow&mdash;in effect, that the U.S .would &ldquo;roll back&rdquo; the Iron Curtain and &ldquo;liberate&rdquo; the &ldquo;enslaved&rdquo; peoples of Eastern Europe.  Good campaign fodder, no doubt, but highly questionable, dangerous policy. When Ike won the election, it took him little time to realize that his campaign &ldquo;roll back&rdquo; strategy made little real sense&mdash;but what made more sense?  What policy better satisfied, and could better protect, America&rsquo;s national security interests?</p>
<p>What did Ike do?  He gathered his most senior advisers in the little-used solarium room on the top floor of the White House.  There, in secret meeting after secret meeting, they debated their policy options.  Ike, seeking consensus, divided them into three groups, encouraging them to come up with an overall strategy: one, led by strategist George Kennan, ended up favoring the old &ldquo;containment&rdquo; policy. Others, who could be described as realists, more skeptical of communism&rsquo;s true intention toward the U.S., pressed for a muscular containment policy, but one that sought to avoid confrontation with the Soviet Union, if at all possible.  And, finally, there were the hawks, for whom war with Moscow was likely, and the U.S. should begin to prepare for it by launching a huge arms program.  For them, &ldquo;roll back&rdquo; was the policy option of necessity.</p>
<p>If anyone got wind of their deliberations, they were to be misled into believing this was the innocent-sounding &ldquo;First National War College Roundtable Seminar,&rdquo; another one of those government panels that produced studies that no one read.  In this way, further inquiry was discouraged.</p>
<p>But it was this seminar, which Ike called the &ldquo;solarium project,&rdquo; that ultimately produced the anti-communist policy followed by one administration after another until December, 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed and communism ceased to be America&rsquo;s major foreign problem.</p>
<p>For the next decade, during the Clinton years, the U.S. struggled to find another overarching policy to satisfy the interests of the country.  But, no luck.  It was only when al-Qaeda terrorists struck the US on 9/11, in a surprise attack reminiscent of the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, that government strategists realized that the U.S. faced an existential threat from global terrorism.  But given the nature of global terrorism&mdash;the absence of a specific address, the shadowy nature of the threats, the interlacing of religion, the rise of Islamic fanaticism&mdash;it remains a difficult chore for policymakers to produce an overarching policy package that will meet the needs of the nation.</p>
<p>Communism had an address&mdash;it was the Kremlin.  Global terrorism has no address, and it is not even clear if it has a leader, making it difficult, if not impossible, for the U.S. to come up with an overall strategy to meet each unexpected eruption.  For example, when the Egyptian military stages a coup and throws the Muslim Brotherhood out of power, what is the proper American response?  The absence of an overall strategy makes this question hard to answer.  When the rebels fighting the Assad regime in Syria begin to fight one another, adding another level of confusion to the situation, raising the prospect of an Assad victory, what should the U.S. do&mdash;send weapons, as it promised to do several weeks ago, or hold back, as it appears to be doing now?  Deeper engagement or another retreat?</p>
<p>It may be time for Obama to summon his top advisers to the White House solarium, call this super-secret gathering the &ldquo;Second National War College Roundtable Seminar,&rdquo; divide it into three groups, encourage a spirited, unafraid exchange of views, and maybe a consensus will emerge&mdash;a new global policy that would help the U.S. meet the new challenges of our time.  Minimally, another solarium seminar might help the president make up his mind about what to do next in Syria and Egypt.  Good luck.</p><div>

<p>This conversation, however, misses a bigger reality: Our metropolitan economies are addicted to energy, meaning we will need to bear the direct and indirect costs of feeding that addiction.</p>
<p>Even as we rely less on coal and use more alternative energy sources, petroleum and natural gas are still the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/mer.pdf" target="_blank">primary fix for our energy habit</a>. Together, they accounted for nearly 64 percent of America&rsquo;s primary energy consumption in 2012, far eclipsing other sources. For better or worse, they are the essential ingredients powering our industries and moving our workers.</p>
<p>Recently, the source of those energy supplies changed significantly. Domestic energy production surged over the past four years, shale gas and crude oil in particular. These rising levels of production, combined with advances in technology and other emerging economic factors, increased <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/historical/realpetr.pdf" target="_blank">several of our&nbsp;energy exports relative to imports</a>. According to some estimates, the United States is poised to pump 11.1 million barrels of oil a day over the next decade, putting it on track to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/u-s-to-overtake-saudi-arabia-s-oil-production-by-2020-iea-says.html" target="_blank">overtake Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s total oil output by 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, what often gets lost in the trade discussion is the effort needed to move all that oil. Since energy is rarely sourced in the same place where it is ultimately consumed, infrastructure&mdash;regardless of its type&mdash;plays a vital role facilitating this movement and fueling our metro economies.</p>
<p>Currently, most of the infrastructure burden falls on pipeline or freight rail. The recent domestic boom has greatly benefited railroads, which provided needed capacity <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=12031&amp;src=email" target="_blank">where pipelines have fallen short</a>. Major firms like Union Pacific and CSX are <a href="https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Documents/Background-Papers/Crude-oil-by-rail.pdf" target="_blank">now transporting&nbsp;record carloads of crude oil</a>&mdash;166 percent more in the first quarter compared to a year ago. Still, by sheer volume,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aopl.org/aboutPipelines/" target="_blank">pipelines remain the&nbsp;primary link</a> to connect oil extraction, refinement, and consumption.</p>
<p>Last week&rsquo;s disaster reminds us of how risky all that movement can be.&nbsp; Accidents happen in infrastructure, whether we want to account for them in our collective consciousness or not. <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/05/portions_of_roadway_damaged_by.html" target="_blank">Truck accidents result in&nbsp;extensive damage every day</a>, and even the safest transportation mode&mdash;aviation&mdash;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/15/us-usa-crash-asiana-lessons-analysis-idUSBRE96E0RI20130715" target="_blank">experienced a domestic&nbsp;crash this month</a>. Train derailments and pipeline leaks both pose significant hazards, and the extent of damage can vary widely as a result. But to point the finger solely at transportation companies misses the point&mdash;it&rsquo;s our need to drive and industrialize that compels oil to move over long distances.</p>
<p>Renewable energy sources may remove the threat of such environmental accidents, but the transition will incur its own costs. Just like oil, the major sites of clean energy production will not be the same as the sites of consumption. For example, sunshine is a precious resource in parts of the Great Lakes and Pacific Northwest, while the Great Plains lacks access to coastal waves. To help that energy move from origin to destination, the country will need to make significant investment in a higher-capacity and more reliable electrical grid, plus new local resources such as car charging stations. Renewables can help reduce oil spills across the continent, but they&rsquo;re no free lunch.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the Obama administration and other leaders face difficult decisions. The Keystone Pipeline remains a political and environmental lightning rod, and now oil-related rail movements may face similar scrutiny. But irrespective of what leadership decides, no policies will change the need to move energy between our markets. In the face of that reality, the real question is what kind of energy do we want to move?</p><div>

Technophobia is a psychological condition, but infectious. Hardly a week goes by without a new outbreak documented in another blog post or business column. To judge from the symptomatic hand-wringing the epidemic is spreading, we are on the verge of mass unemployment as work becomes increasingly automated. </p>
<p>Technophobia is an affliction we have yet to cure even after decades of evidence-based ameliorative efforts. We might not have expected much resistance to the disease in earlier times, before evidence accumulated that the fears it inspired were irrational. Back in 1930, a mind as brilliant as John Maynard Keynes was susceptible to the condition. Keynes sensed sickness in the air but misdiagnosed it as a feature of the capitalist economy: &ldquo;We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come&mdash;namely, technological unemployment.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Years of economic progress would thereafter reveal the misdiagnosis itself as the disease. The computer was invented and subsequently the fastest one increased in speed <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XvB1ZcsrDFAC">by a factor of 100,000</a>.&nbsp; <a href="http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/cromer/Spurious%20Volatility.pdf">Unemployment fell</a> to around five percent from 1930&rsquo;s nine percent. <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~wk2110/uncovering/">Median earnings doubled</a>. Yet a self-appointed committee of public intellectuals declared in a letter to the President that a &ldquo;cybernation revolution&rdquo; was at hand, the product of &ldquo;the combination of the computer and the automated self-regulating machine.&rdquo; The revolution was producing &ldquo;a system of almost unlimited productive capacity which requires progressively less human labor.&rdquo; <a href="http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/peace/papers/1964p.7-01.html">The year was 1964.</a></p>
<p>Between 1964 and 2007, on the eve of the Great Recession, the earnings of the median working-age male rose by about one-third, and while most of that came during the 1960s, <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2013/07/01-mens-rising-earnings">men&rsquo;s earnings did rise modestly after 1969</a>. Median earnings among female workers more than doubled after 1969. Median household income rose by about 75 percent. The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/10/art2full.pdf">typical age</a> at retirement <a href="http://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IB_11-11-508.pdf">declined</a>, and <a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/erik.hurst/research/leisure_sandiego.pdf">leisure time increased</a> among both working age men and women. Unemployment was no higher than five percent, even accounting for adults not included in official figures because they had stopped looking for work out of discouragement. The computing speed of the fastest computer rose by a factor of <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/21791.wss">one billion</a>. With a &ldquo;b&rdquo;. But we cannot shake technophobia. The sense remains that the next one-billion-fold increase in technological progress will be different.</p>
<p>Epidemiologists believe that technophobia&rsquo;s resiliency stems from an elevated susceptibility produced by another condition present in its hosts: excessive economic pessimism. Equally important is the frequent absence of prophylactic humility about the limits of imagination in predicting the future.</p>
<p>Take blogger Kevin Drum&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/print/223026">influential essay</a> from May of this year. Drum sees worrisome long-term declines in income, employment, and the share of national income going to workers. Resistant to evidence that such declines <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43373">either</a> <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2013/03/27-inequality-myths-winship">did not occur</a> or are <a href="http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2012/09/12/misunderstanding_declines_in_labor_force_participation_99874.html">not nearly so</a> <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w15351.pdf?new_window=1">worrisome</a> as he believes, Drum has proven easy prey for technophobia pathogens.</p>
<p>At the same time, with a bit more appreciation for our inability to foresee the ways in which tomorrow&rsquo;s world will differ from today&rsquo;s, those pathogens are easily fended off. Of the Luddites, early 19<sup>th</sup> century weavers who went on a spree smashing power looms out of fear that their adoption would doom workers to misery, Drum writes,</p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 13px;">Power looms put them out of work, but in the long run automation made the entire workforce more productive. Everyone still had jobs&mdash;just different ones. Some ran the new power looms, <i>others found work no one could have imagined just a few decades before</i>, in steel mills, automobile factories, and railroad lines. (Emphasis added.)</span></blockquote>
<p>But we still can&rsquo;t imagine what work will look like in a few decades. In particular, people seem to resist the idea that if technology reduces demand for labor by a quarter, that might translate into <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/02/18/a-cheerful-welcome-to-the-robots-our-future-work-overlords/">everyone working 25 percent less</a> rather than unemployment rising by one-fourth. The late economic historian <a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0226256634">Robert Fogel</a> predicted that the increase in leisure between 1995 and 2040 would exceed the gain Americans saw in the 115 years before 1995.</p>
<p>Will Fogel be proven right? I certainly don&rsquo;t know. What I&rsquo;m pretty sure of, however, is that in 2040 we will not look back at 2013 and think, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made a huge mistake,&rdquo; ruing the day we failed to listen to those afflicted with technophobia. Technological progress is not a trick we have played on ourselves to throw ourselves into poverty. It is a means for fulfilling our material wants and needs and continues only to the extent that it does so.</p>
<p>Technophobia is pernicious not only because it needlessly distresses those it afflicts but because it distracts people from real economic problems that would be tractable if we could focus more narrowly on them. For an example of a productive look at technological change and its implications for workers, don&rsquo;t miss the new Third Way report, <a href="http://content.thirdway.org/publications/714/Dancing-With-Robots.pdf">&ldquo;Dancing with Robots,&rdquo;</a> by economists Frank Levy and Richard Murnane. Levy and Murnane are unconcerned about mass joblessness but argue that the subset of future workers who lack sophisticated skills to manage information will see stagnant or declining wages. </p>
<p>How big is this subset of workers? They do not say, but the less-skilled of their three categories of future jobs&mdash;those comprising &ldquo;non-routine manual tasks&rdquo;&mdash;corresponds closely with the &ldquo;low-wage&rdquo; category used by the Economic Policy Institute <a href="http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/webfac/moretti/e251_s13/mishel.pdf">in a recent paper</a> to analyze occupational changes. That paper finds that 18 percent of jobs are in occupations that tend to pay relatively poorly. In all five decades from 1950 to 2000, the share of workers in high-wage jobs rose faster than the share in low-wage jobs, but the pattern was reversed from 2000 to 2007.&nbsp; Levy and Murnane recommend a transformation of American education to equip more Americans with information-management skills. That seems a more productive course than loom-smashing or preparing for mass unemployment.</p><div>

	</div><a href="http://www.cvent.com/d/lcqh1r/4W">Register for the Event</a><br /><strong>An Address by General Counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence Robert S. Litt</strong><br/><br/>The last several weeks have seen disclosures of information relating to two classified intelligence community programs conducted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).  These programs &ndash; conducted with the approval of the FISA Court, authorized by Congress, and carefully overseen by Congress and the Executive Branch &ndash; seek to keep the U.S. and their allies safe from threats.
<br />
<br />
On July 19, the Brookings Institution will host Robert S. Litt, general counsel with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, for an address on privacy, technology, and security.  Litt will discuss the laws that govern intelligence collection activities, the effect of changing technology, how to ensure security while protecting privacy and constitutional rights and how some of these laws are put into practice. Wells C. Bennett, fellow in national security law and managing editor of <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com">Lawfare</a>, will provide introductory remarks and moderate the discussion.
<br />
<br />
Following his remarks, Litt will take audience questions.

<p>In recent years, mobile technology has expanded dramatically around the world. For a fourth consecutive year, global mobile data traffic has doubled; between 2011 and 2016, it is expected to increase 18-fold. Furthermore, by the end of 2016, 10 billion mobile devices are projected to be in use around the world. Not surprisingly, the development of mobile technologies and applications has paralleled the proliferation of mobile use around the globe. </p>
<p>With increasing evidence of climate change,&nbsp;there has been a&nbsp;rise in the severity and frequency of tsunamis, flooding, drought, hurricanes, and tornados. Natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, the 2013 Oklahoma tornados, and the devastating 2011 drought in the Horn of Africa, are inflicting tremendous damage in terms of human life, injuries, and property damage. </p>
<p>There have also been numerous instances of recent civil unrest, criminal activity and terrorism, ranging from 9/11 to the Virginia Tech shootings to the 2013 Boston bombing. During this time period, the use of smart phones and tablets has become increasingly ubiquitous, with more people than ever turning to mobile applications for information. As a result, mobile development has surged in reaction to the rising demand for instant and accurate information. </p>
<p>In this paper, part of the Brookings Mobile Economy Project, Darrell West and Elizabeth Valentini examine how mobile technology assists in the creation of early warning systems, aids in emergency coordination, and improves public communications in times of crisis. West and Valentini advise policymakers to make better use of current mobile technologies and promote future advances to provide first responders and citizens with the tools necessary to save lives during threatening events. Governments and businesses alike should take full advantage of mobile technology to mitigate property damage, inform the public and save lives. </p><h4>

With an estimated 6 billion mobile phone users worldwide, mobile communications is fast proving to be the most effective and efficient means of reaching and informing the public when disaster strikes. How is mobile technology being used before, during, and after a crisis situation in the United States and around the world?&nbsp; How has mobile communications&rsquo; role in catastrophic situations changed, and how are public safety organizations utilizing this technology to make citizens safer and better prepared? What are the costs and benefits of using mobile technology to ready for and react to a major emergency?&nbsp; </p>
<p class="BodyText">On July 16, as part of the <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/mobile-economy">Mobile Economy Project</a>, the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings hosted a discussion on mobile technology and its evolving role in disaster and public safety. </p>
<p class="BodyText">Participants can follow the conversation on Twitter using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TechCTI&amp;src=hash"><b>#TechCTI</b></a>.</p>

<p>You may wonder, well what&rsquo;s a 130-year-old institution like the Red Cross doing in the new world of mobile technology? But we are seeing it literally revolutionize disaster response. &ndash; Suzy DeFrancis, American Red Cross <br />

<p class="BodyText">Kristina Anderson shared her experience being wounded during the Virginia Tech shooting of 2007, and explained to the audience that very little public safety information was circulated on campus during the shooting, which made it difficult for students to protect themselves. Anderson called on the government to ensure that all campuses across the country have the funding to build strong public safety programs.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="BodyText">James A. Barnett Jr. noted that sometimes during emergencies phone lines are inoperable, and he emphasized that backup satellite networks are crucial; he cited the example of Haiti&rsquo;s generators, which helped cell phone towers operate during the country&rsquo;s devastating earthquakes.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="BodyText">Suzy DeFrancis emphasized that though mobile devices are an important tool for improving public safety, they should be used as an additive disaster response technique and not as a replacement for traditional forms of communication. She stressed that not everyone owns mobile devices, and relying entirely on social media during emergencies can leave the most vulnerable segments of the population unprotected.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="BodyText">Richard Price said that frequently when emergencies occur, members of the public capable of responding to the crisis are nearby but are unaware that the disaster is occurring. Price described his organization, the PulsePoint Foundation, which notifies CPR-trained individuals if there is someone experiencing cardiac arrest nearby to them.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="BodyText">Anita Stewart said during disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, children often get lost, unsure how to protect themselves. She stressed that instructions issued during emergencies must be simple and easy for youth to follow; for instance, her organization uses Muppets to communicate public safety information accessible to all ages.&nbsp; </p>

<p>At Virginia Tech we saw students who were trying to be quiet, trying to get help, texting 911 and at that time those texts went nowhere. Now we&rsquo;re on the road to making sure that those can be received and handled by the 911 call centers. &ndash; James A. Barnett, Venable LLC <br />

		<p>July 15, 2013<br />11:00 AM - 12:30 PM EDT</p><p>Falk Auditorium<br/>Brookings Institution<br/>1775 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W.<br/>Washington, DC 20036</p>
	</div>On July 15, the <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/mgo">Managing Global Order project at Brookings</a>&nbsp;hosted Jeffrey Feltman, the United Nations under-secretary-general for political affairs to discuss the role of UN diplomacy in today&rsquo;s crises around the globe. His remarks focused on UN efforts in Syria, Somalia and the Great Lakes region in Africa. Feltman was joined by a panel that included Wegger Strommen, the ambassador of Norway to the U.S., Bruce Jones, senior fellow and director of the Managing Global Order project at Brookings and moderator Martin Indyk, vice president and director of Foreign Policy at Brookings. <br />
<br />
Feltman opened his remarks by posing two broader questions that he hoped to answer, both relating to the UN&rsquo;s role in conflict mediation. First, what are the main differences between working on peace and diplomacy multilaterally versus UN bilateral diplomacy? Second, what are some of the key challenges that the UN faces when engaging in diplomatic efforts?  <br />
<br />
In regards to the first question, Feltman said he underestimated the time and effort necessary to adjust to the intricacies of UN diplomacy, as he had worked primarily within the field of U.S. diplomacy prior to his appointment at the UN.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Until you leave the U.S. government, you cannot fully grasp what it means to walk into a room, backed at all times, by the tangible powers of the presidency, the Pentagon, the dollar, the voting weight of the IMF and the World Bank and the permanent seat on the UN Security Council,&rdquo; Feltman said. <br />
<br />
However, he added that UN officials also wield important sources of power as they attempt to coax antagonists toward peace. He said learning how to leverage &ldquo;intangibles&rdquo;&mdash;including ideals, values and impartiality&mdash;has been crucial in his UN education. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;The legitimacy the UN can convey on issues of peace and security cannot be replicated by any single nation, no matter how powerful,&rdquo; Feltman said. He also emphasized that almost all conflicts are rooted in politics, so it is crucial for the UN to understand the political nature of their mediating efforts. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;Lasting solutions to conflicts require working the politics in tough places,&rdquo; Feltman added. <br />
<br />
Feltman then began to narrow in on the ongoing war in Syria. He cited Syria as an example of a challenge the UN faces when a divergence of perspectives paralyzes the Security Council.  The UN is currently facing a deadlock regarding a political solution to the conflict, so Feltman mentioned three different areas that his office emphasizes in regards to the ongoing crisis. <br />
<br />
First, the UN has continued to focus on mobilizing support for humanitarian relief to aid refugees and internally displaced persons both in Syria and in neighboring countries. The UN is also working to mitigate dangers and spillover conflict in Jordan and Lebanon, two neighboring countries that have experienced a large influx of Syrian refugees.  Finally, the UN is committed to organizing post-conflict planning. Feltman reemphasized that he does not believe there is an immediate military solution to the conflict, so the UN&rsquo;s role is to help the necessary political actors reach a political solution. <br />
<br />
He then turned to Somalia, which he said is currently at a potential turning point. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;For the UN, this country represents the challenge of how, in the face of so many crises demanding attention, the UN can help to sustain regional and international focus on a process that has the promise of real success but still needs to be nurtured,&rdquo; Feltman said. <br />
<br />
The task of ending anarchy and building a stable government in Somalia has taken on great strategic and humanitarian significance for the UN. Feltman noted that the UN has invested heavily in Somalia, with key partners in the African Union and the U.S. The organization helped mediate the 2008 Djibouti Agreement, which laid out a roadmap to transition last year when Somalis elected a new government.<h4>

Commissioner Barnier presented his views on how best to accelerate progress towards genuine financial stability. Brookings Fellow Douglas Elliott hosted the discussion and moderated a question and answer period.</p>
<p>Barnier began his remarks by describing how the European Union and the United States came to an agreement about how to regulate cross-border swaps at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, three and a half years ago. This &ldquo;ambitious global regulatory reform of the swaps markets&rdquo; set out to do three strategic tasks:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Clearing:</strong> To reduce risk in our financial firms and system by clearing all standardized swaps through central counterparties.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> To shed light on this opaque market and report all trades to trade repositories. We need to know where risk is building up in the system.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Trading:</strong> Where appropriate, to move standardized swaps to venues to increase market transparency</li>
</ol>
<p>Barnier compared uncoordinated cross-border regulations between the United States and the European Union to &ldquo;squeezing a bar of soap with wet hands: it slips from your hands. Trades will be re-booked. Markets will fragment. The G20 reform objectives will not be met.&rdquo; Barnier noted that 70% of all global economic transactions take place between the United States and the European Union nations. For this reason, he argued that the United States and European Union need to &ldquo;lead by example&rdquo; by carrying out necessary economic reforms to meet G20 commitments &ldquo;rigorously and sensibly.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Barnier described the trade negotiations between the European Union and the United States that began last week as focused on &ldquo;growth and leadership,&rdquo; which are imperative to cultivating new jobs in each sovereign nation, as well as finding solutions to trade predicaments that cannot be found through multilateral discussions. Barnier argued that the &ldquo;barriers to EU-US trade and investment are in the details of regulatory policy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;regulatory barriers can block trade outright. Make it too expensive to be viable. Fragment global markets. Or just act as a drag on overall economic efficiency.&rdquo; Mitigating these barriers through regulatory reform will effectively protect the European Union and the U.S. economies from risks to their citizens and financial security.</p>
<p>To conclude his remarks, Barnier noted that the fundamental component of transatlantic trade reform is the joint leadership between the United States and the European Union. He believes &ldquo;our financial sectors know no borders. They are intertwined and interdependent.&rdquo; By reflecting on the agreement on swaps, Commissioner Barnier believes that the United States and European Union can create a dynamic bond that will &ldquo;raise the bar in tomorrow&rsquo;s world of financial regulation.&rdquo;</p><h4>

Decades of underinvestment in key infrastructure assets are taking their toll on the U.S. economy. Unreliable transportation infrastructure, aging water systems, inefficient and carbon-intensive power production, and second-rate telecommunication networks are eroding the nation's global competitiveness. Furthermore, recent disasters, such as Superstorm Sandy, threw our aging infrastructure into the national spotlight.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yet while Washington remains mired in uncertainty and gridlock, states are developing new ways to select, fund, and build economically important projects. While many states remain unprepared for these new responsibilities, a handful of leaders have stepped up to develop new tools, rules, and institutions that are getting infrastructure projects done. <br />
<br />
On Friday, July 12, the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings hosted a forum on the best in class innovations that &ldquo;can-do&rdquo; states across the country are pursuing to take control of their infrastructure agendas. Following the presentation on the state of American infrastructure investment, an expert panel discussed key developments in enabling legislation, revolving funds, internal coordination, and procurement processes taking place in their states. The session closeed with a keynote address on the future of infrastructure investment </p>

While Muslim Brotherhood supporters protest the removal and arrest of Mohamed Morsi, many Egyptians saw the military&rsquo;s actions as necessary to realize the revolution&rsquo;s original goals. Will the military&rsquo;s decision to replace Morsi advance the cause of sustainable democracy, or will it further entrench the country&rsquo;s authoritarian past? What can other countries&rsquo; experiences tell us about the role of militaries in democratization? <br />

</b>The U.S. financial system is critical to the functioning of the economy as a whole and banks are central to the financial system. In addition to providing substantial employment, finance serves three main purposes:</p>
<p><b>Credit provision</b>. Credit fuels economic activity by allowing businesses to invest beyond their cash on hand, households to purchase homes without saving the entire cost in advance, and governments to smooth out their spending by mitigating the cyclical pattern of tax revenues and to invest in infrastructure projects. Banks directly provide a substantial amount of credit in the U.S., but, unlike in almost any other economy, financial markets are the ultimate providers of most credit.</p>
<p><b>Liquidity provision</b>. Businesses and households need to have protection against unexpected needs for cash. Banks are the main direct providers of liquidity, both through offering demand deposits that can be withdrawn any time and by offering lines of credit. Further, banks and their affiliates are at the core of the financial markets, offering to buy and sell securities and related products at need, in large volumes, with relatively modest transaction costs. This latter role is particularly important in the U.S., given the dominance of markets, but is often under-appreciated.</p>
<p><b>Risk management services</b>. Finance allows businesses and households to pool their risks from exposures to financial market and commodity price risks. Much of this is provided by banks through derivatives transactions. These have gotten a bad name due to excesses in the run-up to the financial crisis but the core derivatives activities provide valuable risk management services.</p>
<p>Many argue that the U.S. financial system grew overly large in the bubble period and is still too large today. We agree that some of the activities that took place in the bubble period involved taking on excess amounts of risk, but it is extremely hard to determine the right size of the financial system based on well-grounded economic theories. In truth, it is very difficult to judge the right size of almost any industry and attempts at the use of central planning and other mechanisms to correct assumed problems of this nature have usually failed.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume that a sector will be too large if there are unwarranted economic subsidies flowing to it. This does appear to have been the case in the bubble and may still be the case, although such subsidies have been much reduced by a series of actions to remove government support and to force the financial industry to operate more safely.</p>
<p>However, we suspect the excessive size in the bubble period was considerably less than many argue and we believe it is important to be cautious in drawing policy conclusions as it seems impossible to prove whether the sector was or is too large and by how much.</p>
<p>There are a number of important proposals to force major changes in the structure of the financial industry, including to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Eliminate Too Big to Fail banks by forcing their break-up or downsizing</li>
    <li>Limit the functions of banks &agrave; la Glass Steagall or the Volcker Rule</li>
</ul>
<p>Banks that are central to our financial system, whether through sheer size or the critical nature of the services they provide, are perceived by many to benefit from an implicit government guarantee that ought to be eliminated. The main categories of proposals are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Break up the largest banks</li>
    <li>Mandate a size limit</li>
    <li>Push large banks to shrink voluntarily by imposing stiff costs for size</li>
    <li>Put in place a credible plan for resolving the largest institutions</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not favor the proposals to break up the banks or force them to shrink dramatically. We believe that the best analysis indicates considerable economic benefits to size and scope and that these advantages are likely to grow further with increasing globalization, complexity, and improved information and management systems. America should have at least a few financial institutions with global scale, capable of providing a wide range of related commercial and investment banking services, operating on a scale in individual product lines that produces real efficiency. </p>
<p>This will almost certainly mean these firms are important enough to the economy that the government and regulators will need to watch them particularly carefully and may create need for special assistance, in extreme crisis situations of the level that are unlikely to occur more than once or twice a century. For this reason, we agree on the need to designate systemically important financial institutions and to require them to operate with higher safety margins.</p>
<p>We believe that the societal benefits of breaking up the large banks are over-stated. The recent financial crisis was much more about system-wide problems than about issues resulting from excessive size of financial institutions. A simple thought experiment illustrates this. If we had broken up the big banks a decade ago into 10 or 20 pieces each, they would likely all or virtually all have made the same mistakes. They would have over-invested in real estate-related products, taken excessive risks across the board, created opaque and risky securitizations and derivatives products, pushed accounting rules to their limits, etc. The other players in the financial system would presumably also have made the same mistakes, including the ratings agencies, governments, central banks, regulators, and families and businesses. It is difficult to presume that the disaster would have been much different. Indeed, there is a chance that the clean-up would have been more difficult without the ability to pull 17 key CEOs into a room and force them to accept the TARP arrangements.</p>
<p>The next financial crisis will almost certainly differ from the last, as every such crisis varies, but it remains difficult to see how a system of many mid-sized banks would be appreciably safer than one with some large banks as part of the mix.</p>
<p>We do favor ensuring that even the most important banks can be resolved effectively without the use of taxpayer funds, except perhaps for relatively short-term liquidity purposes and backed by solid collateral. Dodd-Frank goes a long way towards achieving this goal, but more could be done.</p>
<p><i>Activity limitations</i></p>
<p>U.S. commercial banks and their affiliates have always faced limitations on the business they are allowed to undertake, in order to reduce the risk of business disasters that would endanger their ability to fulfill their critical role at the heart of the economic system. </p>
<p>These limitations were considerably extended in the Great Depression. The Glass-Steagall Act was passed, making it illegal for a commercial bank to be affiliated with an investment bank. The former could undertake the types of activities we normally associate with banking, such as taking deposits and lending. The latter were principally involved in the securities business, through helping firms raise capital by selling stocks and bonds, assisting investors in buying and selling those securities, and trading them for the investment bank&rsquo;s own account.</p>
<p>The anti-affiliation provisions of Glass-Steagall were dramatically modified in the 1990&rsquo;s, allowing commercial and investment banks to be part of the same financial group, although there remain a number of important restrictions to limit dealings within the group.</p>
<p>There is a range of proposals to further limit the ability of banks to operate in the securities and derivatives businesses. Some call for a restoration of the anti-affiliation provisions of Glass-Steagall. Others want Glass-Steagall Lite, since they recognize that changing times make it difficult to simply turn back the clock. The Volcker Rule is intended to separate out proprietary trading completely from commercial banks <i>and</i> investment banks.</p>
<p>We do not favor any of the major proposals for further structural divisions between commercial banking and securities and derivatives activities. We believe that the U.S. capital markets are world leaders and that their strength is an important economic advantage for America. Those markets are underpinned by the role of major securities dealers that are closely affiliated with commercial banks. A major reason for the close linkages is the desire of corporate customers to be able to deal with financial firms that can provide a solid range of products from financial advice to loans to securities offerings to risk management via derivatives to purely operational products. The institutional knowledge and relationships that a banking group has in regard to its corporate customers is a valuable advantage both for the bank and for those customers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Further, times have changed and will not change back. Glass-Steagall was based on a clear difference between a loan and a security, a difference that no longer exists now that most large loans are tradable among banks and also specialized investors. At this point, it is usually possible to structure a given transaction as a loan or a security or a derivatives transaction or often as insurance or another contractual arrangement.</p>
<p>Finally, any transition from the current system to an older-style system will create very considerable displacement of activities, with a real potential for problems. Some of this might occur through the divestiture of investment banking subsidiaries from banking groups, which would be the simplest approach; however even this would involve a large amount of change at a time when the U.S. economy remains in a fragile recovery that resulted in part from the disruption of the financial sector.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another source of displacement would result from striving mid-level securities firms grabbing market share. Although this could bring advantages, it also creates the danger of a repeat of a situation such as developed at MF Global, where the push for growth overcame proper risk management practices.</p><h4>

<p>Chairmen Poe and Ros-Lehtinen, Ranking Members Sherman and Deutch, distinguished members of the subcommittees and staff, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am honored to be here to express my views. I am also humbled to be here on the panel with Michael Lovelady. Please know that my thoughts go out to him and the other relatives of those Americans who have died in Algeria and from other terrorist attacks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The terrorist attacks in Benghazi that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans have received exhaustive coverage, yet many of the long-term implications have not been fully considered. Future attacks, particularly those in North Africa, are likely to involve a Benghazi-style mix of jihadists of different nationalities, making it difficult to determine exactly who is responsible. Libya remains troubled, and the broader Maghreb and Sahel areas are unstable. Greater state weakness, not more stability, is likely in the years to come. So similar plots may be in our future.</p>
<p>I believe the U.S. reaction to the Benghazi attack, however, is likely to leave us less prepared for future terrorism. U.S. knowledge of Libya and the region has always been limited. Unfortunately, the political and bureaucratic lesson of Benghazi is clear &ndash; avoid risks at all costs. American diplomats and spies will be more confined to well-guarded parts of capital cities and more removed from local populations. This will keep them safer, but U.S. intelligence is likely to decline, and U.S. statecraft to diminish. In the long-run, diminishing U.S. capabilities could pose a grave danger to U.S. security, increasing the risk of a surprise attack or a regional development that catches the United States unawares. In addition, jihadists may point to any U.S. retreat after Benghazi as proof of U.S. cowardice.</p>
<p>The United States should bolster, not draw down, its presence in North Africa. America has important interests in the region and in any case the threats will not disappear simply because the U.S. chooses to ignore them. The region is now an important arena for jihadists, and the size of their area of operation is growing. In addition, jihadists from the region and weapons from Libya are showing up in places like Syria and Sinai. </p>
<p>We should seek to understand and engage regional governments and peoples to counter the threats that emanate from North Africa. To this end, Washington should maintain a robust and energetic intelligence and diplomatic presence, even in dangerous countries or ones that suffer from governments that reject democratic practices. Because the operating environment is risky, the United States should augment and systematize its rapid response capabilities and its post-attack procedures. In addition, Washington should ado<a name="_GoBack"></a>pt a more regional response to the terrorism threat, work more with allies like France to prepare for contingencies, and increase overall intelligence and diplomatic attention to the Maghreb and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The remainder of my testimony has three parts. First, I briefly discuss the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and assess what it means for the state of Al Qaeda today. Second, I discuss future challenges in the Maghreb, including Algeria as well as Libya, from a counterterrorism point of view. Third, I present implications and recommendations for the United States.</p>
<p><strong>I. The Benghazi Attack and the State of Al Qaeda</strong></p>
<p>The Benghazi attack exhibited several characteristics that are likely to manifest in future terrorist attacks in the Maghreb region. The attacks were:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Of Limited Sophistication</em></strong>. In contrast to the years of planning that went into the 9/11 attacks and other terrorism &ldquo;spectaculars,&rdquo; the attackers in Benghazi used military methods suggesting basic coordination and training but not more cutting-edge methods. The weapons used &ndash; RPGs, AK-47s, heavy machine guns and artillery mounted on trucks, and so on &ndash; are not advanced and are widely available. Many fighters from Al Qaeda, associated movements, and jihadist local organizations have these skills and similar weapons. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>Not Tied to Particular Events</strong></em>. Although some initial reports suggested that the attackers used the &ldquo;Innocence of Muslims&rdquo; video and associated demonstrations as justification, subsequent information makes clear this was at most a pretext. The United States was supporting efforts of the government of Libya to consolidate control over the eastern part of the country, but there was no single identifiable U.S. government action at the time that drew the ire of local terrorists: rather local jihadists simply wanted to attack U.S. personnel and facilities and did so. Even assuming the video in question mattered, there will always be similar pretexts that terrorist groups can cite to justify their attacks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Continued Vulnerability of Diplomatic Facilities</em></strong>. Diplomatic facilities, like military forces and civil aviation, remain a constant source of targeting interest for jihadist attackers. Between1998 and 2011 there were 13 deadly attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities, most of which were linked to Al Qaeda, associated movements, or those who share aspects of its ideology. There were also innumerable attempted attacks and plots that were abandoned because of effective intelligence and defensive measures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>Not a Reflection of Al Qaeda Popularity</strong></em>. Extremist Islamist movements are not particularly strong and popular in the Maghreb. In Algeria in particular they are less popular than they were in the 1990s. Rather, as discussed below, these groups take advantage of weak governments and a chaotic operating environment more than they depend on public support. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>Not Linked to U.S. Popularity</strong></em>. Some polls showed Libyans in general to be the most pro-American of all Arab states, with eastern Libya in particularly having a favorable view of Americans due to the prominent American role in helping the Libyan revolution defeat Qaddafi&rsquo;s forces.[1] Although foreigners and foreign influence are unpopular in parts of Libya and the United States is seen as supporting some factions over others, only a minority of Libyans supported the attacks, and only a minority of a minority was actively involved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>A Mix of Groups and Individuals</strong></em>. It does not appear that the Al Qaeda core orchestrated the Benghazi attack, and the assault shows how the core has spawned a variety of lesser but lethal movements. The attack involved individuals from multiple groups, making it difficult to narrow responsibility even months after the attack. In addition to Libya itself groups and factions from Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, and Algeria all seem to have been involved.[2] This sort of networked coordination, where like-minded individuals from different organizations cooperate in limited ways, is typical of Al Qaeda and associated movements as well as individuals who share no formal affiliation with the mother movement but embrace parts of its ideology.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Nature and Limits of Al Qaeda-Type Groups in the Maghreb</strong></p>
<p>Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and other groups in the region are capable of massive violence, even by the standards of the broader Al Qaeda-linked movements. During the 1990s, the Algerian civil war saw unspeakable horrors against civilians. According to Canadian diplomat Robert Fowler, who was kidnapped by AQIM, the terrorists whom he came to know were far more impressed with the late Iraqi leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who personally beheaded captives and favored bloody attacks on fellow Muslims who would not support his leadership, over the (relatively) more muted and anti-Western approach favored by Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.<a name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The various organizations in the Maghreb are divided but not necessarily hostile to one another. Many are linked in one way or another to AQIM, whose key leaders are Algerian but whose membership includes a wider range of individuals from around the region. Although AQIM has many splinters, the splinters often work together, cooperating on attacks, kidnappings, and other operations. </p>
<p>Al Qaeda affiliates and local organizations, like Ansar al-Sharia embrace some of Al Qaeda&rsquo;s rhetoric, but they are not under Zawahiri&rsquo;s thumb and many have little direct organizational relationship. &nbsp;The core organization under Bin Ladin, and now Zawahiri, used to bring people under its banner because it could offer money and useful services like training camps. Both these incentives have been diminished.<a name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> Affiliates and local groups often disagree with core leadership on a wide variety of issues, ranging from target prioritization to the degree and types of civilians who might be attacked. To the disappointment of al-Qaeda&rsquo;s core leadership, AQIM leaders have not tried hard to mobilize supporters in Europe on behalf of global jihad and have not brought the &ldquo;war&rdquo; to the Continent.<a name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> As Jean-Pierre Filiu comments, AQIM &ldquo;is the branch of the global jihad that has most clearly failed to follow its founding guidelines.&rdquo;<a name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>In addition, the highly effective U.S. drone campaign has not only removed key Al Qaeda core leaders but has also made it far harder for them to communicate with one another and exercise command over the broader jihadist movement. A tip sheet found among jihadists in Mali advised militants to avoid drones by maintaining &ldquo;complete silence of all wireless contacts,&rdquo; to &ldquo;avoid gathering in open areas,&rdquo; noting that leaders &ldquo;should not use communications equipment,&rdquo; and taking strenuous measures to root out spies, among other suggestions.<a name="_ftnref7" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> The implications for group effectiveness are staggering. In essence group leaders cannot lead as they must hide or remain incommunicado. Training on a large-scale is hard if not impossible, as large gatherings can be lethal. In combat, they cannot mass or bring in significant reinforcements. In other words, the drones turn al-Qa&rsquo;ida&rsquo;s command and control structure into a liability, forcing it to have no leaders or risk dead leaders.</p>
<p>The bad news is that affiliates themselves are filling the void created by the weakness of the core. For years Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was a strong and powerful force that influenced other jihadist groups. AQIM is trying to play that role in the Maghreb, working as we have seen with groups in Libya and Mali, and expanding ties to Nigeria&rsquo;s Boko Haram.</p>
<p>Al Qaeda and its allies are likely to see the U.S. response to the Benghazi attack as a victory and proof of America&rsquo;s cowardice. Bin Ladin had long claimed that the United States hid behind defenses and technology and pointed to U.S. withdrawals from Lebanon and Somalia after terrorist attacks as &ldquo;proof&rdquo; that the United States will fold if hit hard. The U.S. retreat from Benghazi and the handwringing in the United States risk encouraging the jihadist perception that the United States has not changed even after 9/11.</p>
<p><strong>II. Future Counterterrorism Challenges in the Maghreb </strong></p>
<p>Beyond the specific implications for Al Qaeda and associated movements in the Maghreb, the United States is likely to find counterterrorism more difficult because of the high level of instability in the region and the difficulty of working with key partners like Algeria. </p>
<p><strong>The Spread of Instability</strong></p>
<p>A functional Libyan state has never really existed. Qaddafi, rather than building one, ruled through fear and vision. Enabled by its vast hydrocarbon wealth, the Libyan economy was top-down, never allowing the private sector and an independent middle class to develop. </p>
<p>The stability of Libya today has not fundamentally changed since the September 11, 2012 attacks: anarchy does not reign complete, but neither has the government consolidated power. Since the revolution the country has had successful elections, and its economy has recovered reasonably though oil exports still remain less than pre-revolutionary levels. Islam and some sense of Libyan identity are unifying forces. In addition, Libya&rsquo;s neighbors &ndash; in contrast, to say, Syria&rsquo;s &ndash; have not actively intervened to back one faction over another. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the state still does not function: the army, the police, the judiciary, and other basic security institutions are weak and politicized.<a name="_ftnref8" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Armed gangs and militias, some of which reflect tribal or regional forces and others leftovers from the revolution, remain active almost two years of the revolution. The militias vary in type, legitimacy, and size: some have revolutionary legitimacy and local support; others are criminals masquerading as community defenders. The country lacks an effective judicial system, so militias rather than the police or authorized officials arrest those suspected of crimes, run prisons, and otherwise offer a form of rough justice.<a name="_ftnref9" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> When powerful sub-state actors oppose any particular government action, they simply seize the ministry or surround the Congress and force the government to acquiesce. These militias are both the source of many problems, particularly the lack of government authority and legitimacy, and a reflection of them. Libyan institutions and security forces remain weak and discredited, so people turn to militias; because militias are strong, Libya&rsquo;s state remains weak. On balance conflicts in Libya are limited, but they are not moving toward resolution. Because of this weakness, the Libyan state has not consolidated power in much of the country and is unable to disarm or crush groups like Ansar al-Sharia. This includes much of eastern Libya, but also much of the southern desert regions. </p>
<p>Libya is ripe for homegrown terrorists and foreign terrorist penetration. The Al Qaeda core has long included Libyans in its ranks and reportedly dispatched operatives to build an organization in the post-Qaddafi era. Jihadists of various stripes were released from jail, and some returned to Libya from exile. Homegrown groups like Ansar Al-Sharia have found room to operate. In addition, the Libyan civil war has opened up Qaddafi&rsquo;s vast arsenals to Libyan groups, and Libyan weapons have found their way not only to its neighbors like Mali but also to Gaza, Sinai, and even Syria.<a name="_ftnref10" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>More broadly, the Maghreb and the Sahel region are highly unstable. Two of Libya&rsquo;s neighbors, Egypt and Tunisia, have undergone dramatic regime changes in recent years, and at the date of this testimony Egypt&rsquo;s future course is anyone&rsquo;s guess. Sudan recently saw the secession of its southern region while other parts of the country clamor for independence. Nigeria and Mali suffer civil wars. Chad is poor, corrupt, and plagued by coups and has suffered several dramatic terrorist attacks in recent months. Borders in the Maghreb are porous. Part of this is geographic and historical &ndash; various tribes have long had economic and kinship ties that transcend borders &ndash; but the biggest problem is government weakness. So even if one country is adopting policies that make it stronger, it can still suffer violence emanating from its neighbors.</p>
<p>Not only does instability in one regional state affect its neighbors, but the Maghreb in general is an exporter of radicalism. A recent Washington Institute for Near East Policy study found Tunisia and Libya &ndash; more even than traditional producers of radicals like Saudi Arabia &ndash; was a source of suicide bombers for the Syrian conflict.<a name="_ftnref11" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> So the United States cannot write off this region in the hope that its trouble will remain geographically confined. </p>
<p><strong>Algerian Dilemmas</strong></p>
<p>The only strong regime in the region is Algeria &ndash; and the United States knows relatively little about this country and has at best a lukewarm relationship with its government. Algerians are the core of AQIM, and the government runs the most extensive spy network in the region: so we must look to Algeria to get at both the problem and the solution. Algeria was more pro-Soviet than pro-American in the Cold War, and it is prickly about its independence. Part of this is because of the secretive nature of the Algerian regime. However, Algeria has not been an intelligence or diplomatic priority. Algeria has long bristled at many cooperation requests, though intelligence cooperation did improve after 9/11 and is now far better. However, from an intelligence point of view, the Algerian government has a history of manipulating opposition groups, including violent terrorists, making it difficult to trust the information it provides. In particular, there are rumors that Algerian intelligence has worked with Iyad Ag Ghali, the head of Ansar al-Dine in Mali, and also with Mukhtar Belmukhtar. The Algerian government seeks to divert these groups against other targets and divide the movement, but in doing so it is playing with fire.<a name="_ftnref12" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Despite its relative strength, Algeria&rsquo;s own stability is in question. Predicting social revolution is notoriously difficult, but Algeria seems ripe for dramatic change. Algeria has resisted the Arab spring so far: the regime&rsquo;s ruthless and effective repression, its ability to coopt potential rivals, and the memory of a horrific civil war that left an estimated 200,000 dead in the 1990s have dissuaded citizens from taking to the streets in large numbers. However, with neighbors like Tunisia and Libya in the throes of change, a stagnant economy, a large youth population, and a government with weak legitimacy, mass protests could sweep Algeria. In particular, the recent stroke of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, though his role was largely to offer a fa&ccedil;ade for military rule, could foster a succession question that leads Algerians to demand more serious change &ndash; this may occur even before the scheduled 2014 Presidential elections. What the future holds is unclear: the United States must be prepared for revolution, instability, or continued rule by the military and security services.</p>
<p><strong>III. Implications and Recommendations for the United States</strong></p>
<p>The aftermath of the Benghazi attack and subsequent events in North Africa suggest four areas in which the United States must improve: bolstering <em>local </em>intelligence and diplomacy, augmenting apid reaction capabilities, making foreign policy reflect regional as well as state-focused concerns, and increasing overall attention to the Maghreb and surrounding areas.</p>
<p><strong>Local Intelligence and Diplomacy</strong></p>
<p>Better intelligence and good local relations are important for keeping Americans safe in different parts in the world and in the U.S. homeland. It is impossible to quantify the benefits derived, but better intelligence allows numerous plots to be disrupted, and better relations reduces hostility to the United States and improves cooperation when trying to disrupt attacks or manage their consequences. Trying to improve intelligence and relations, however, will put those Americans charged with gathering intelligence and improving relations at more risk.</p>
<p>That Benghazi was dangerous was well-known to all. Before the September 11 attack, an IED breached the U.S. consulate in Benghazi&rsquo;s perimeter. The International Committee of the Red Cross, in general a bold organization, had suspended operations there before the attack that killed Ambassador Stevens. There had been attacks on the British ambassador and on the Tunisian embassy. Other diplomats and foreign citizens were kidnapped or attacked. Indeed, the presence of terrorism was the reason for such a large intelligence presence in Benghazi.</p>
<p>Ambassador Stevens knew Libya and Benghazi well. He was popular among Libyans and his worry about the dangerous security environment in Benghazi stemmed in part from this knowledge. During my time as a staff member of the 9/11 Commission and for the House and Senate joint committee investigating 9/11, we constantly pushed for a CIA and a State Department that was more expeditionary and willing to take risks &ndash; in short, we wanted more people with the courage, experience, skill, and mindset of Ambassador Stevens. His loss was a great tragedy for our country.</p>
<p>The U.S. reaction to his death, however, risks putting undue constraints on American intelligence and diplomacy. These will ultimately undermine rather than protect U.S. interests abroad and safety at home. The bureaucratic and political lesson of Benghazi is to further confine American diplomats and spies in well-guarded parts of a capital city and remove them even more from the local population. This will keep them safer, but it will also make them less effective. They will not mingle with the local population and learn their concerns and gain their support (indeed, a recent attempted attack on Italian diplomats in Libya was foiled by an alert and supportive Libyan citizen).<a name="_ftnref13" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> They will be less able to gather intelligence on local groups. They will not take risks. And America will be less able to stop terrorism and secure its interests.</p>
<p>The United States will also become more dependent on foreign governments to provide intelligence. At times, reliance on foreign governments is beneficial &ndash; even ideal. In Morocco, for example, the local intelligence service is skilled and an important partner of the United States. In Algeria, however, the intelligence service is often suspicious of close cooperation with the United States. In countries like Libya and Mali, the intelligence services are weak and do not have access to or extensive sources in much of their countries. In such cases the United States needs to develop its own sources.</p>
<p>In Sudan, the United States closed its embassy in 1996 due to the high risk of a terrorist attack. &nbsp;From a force protection perspective, this made sense: the danger was quite real. It also meant, however, the United States lost valuable intelligence on a nascent Al Qaeda and was unable to recognize important shifts in the attitude of the government of Sudan toward counterterrorism cooperation. In the long-term the loss of this information may have cost American lives. Cutting and running from places like Benghazi may lead to similar losses.</p>
<p>The United States still needs to deploy diplomats and spies in danger zones. In many ways, they are America&rsquo;s first line of defense, learning about problems before they are apparent in Washington and cultivating assets to handle them. In addition, the United States needs local access after any attack. As the problems the FBI has incurred in its Benghazi investigation suggest, the government in Tripoli cannot ensure access to the scene of the attack and other important investigative needs. Washington also needs local sources to learn more about the identity of the attackers and possible follow-on attacks.</p>
<p>The Obama administration and the U.S. Congress &ndash; including the leadership of both parties &ndash; should make it clear that &ldquo;failures&rdquo; like Benghazi will be scrutinized, but also that we should expect losses when diplomats and spies operate in remote parts of unstable countries about which we know little where terrorist groups are also active. Surprise, mistakes, and bureaucratic confusion will be inevitable, and risk-taking should be rewarded over a caution that leaves the United States blinded, uninformed, and with few local friends as trouble develops.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid Reaction Standardization</strong></p>
<p>It would have been difficult for outside forces to have rescued Ambassador Stevens and his colleagues given the ferocity and rapid nature of the attack. And, in general, tactical warning is usually absent when it comes to terrorist attacks. One of the responses to this lack of tactical warning was to improve the defenses at U.S. embassies &ndash; the so-called &ldquo;Inman guidelines.&rdquo;<a name="_ftnref14" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> Although U.S. defenses are far from foolproof, they have saved many lives as terrorist groups have been foiled or have moved on to other targets.</p>
<p>The United States must improve its ability to respond rapidly to unexpected terrorist attacks like the Benghazi assault. Anticipating the type of motley medley of groups and individuals involved in Benghazi is difficult. Moreover, given the unsure security situation in Libya &ndash; and problems facing the United States elsewhere in the region given government weakness and limits on intelligence &ndash; we should expect regular surprises from groups and cells of which we were previously unaware.</p>
<p>In some cases even careful advanced preparation will matter little, but in others it may prove the difference between life and death. In April 2013, the Pentagon announced that the U.S. Marines had developed a rapid reaction force for North Africa that could quickly deploy 500 Marines within 12 hours.<a name="_ftnref15" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> &nbsp;This is impressive progress, but the time window needs to be smaller. This may involve deploying a smaller force &ndash; again, which means incurring more risk &ndash; but this could save many lives while enabling more expeditionary U.S. intelligence and diplomacy. Nevertheless, we must move away from the idea that spies and diplomats will have absolute protection. Even spending vast amounts of money to improve rapid reaction will still leave U.S. officials vulnerable if they are aggressively gathering information and trying to win over locals as they should be.</p>
<p><strong>A Regional Response</strong></p>
<p>U.S. diplomacy in North Africa and the Sahel area is still divided by country, and in some cases by geographic divisions (&ldquo;Near East&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Africa&rdquo;). There is no ideal bureaucratic organization that perfectly balances state-specific concerns with ones that cross borders like terrorism, but in general U.S. bureaucracies are not well coordinated across regional lines. But terrorist groups from Algeria operate in Libya, what happens in Libya shapes Mali, and what happened in Mali contributed to terrorist attacks in Algeria and Niger. Although the terrorism problem crosses borders, different ambassadors have different policies regarding counterterrorism efforts. North Africa and the Sahel region tend to be separate bureaucratically even though many of their problems are linked. The U.S. military has steadily developed and expanded regional bodies like AFRICOM to meet this challenge. Intelligence and diplomatic structures need to follow suit.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prioritizing the Maghreb and Surrounding Areas</strong></p>
<p>Often with justification, the United States has not made Algeria, Libya, Mali, and other states in the region priorities. Historic ties are limited, their energy supplies were not under threat, and their role in issues such as the Arab-Israeli dispute was marginal.</p>
<p>With the spread of Al Qaeda-focused international terrorism, however, the balance of interests has changed. The region itself is now an important theater of jihad, with AQIM playing a regional role and numerous smaller groups showing up elsewhere in the several countries. Even worse, as the Syrian civil war indicates, the region is now an exporter of terror, with volunteers from the Maghreb and weapons from Libya showing up many miles away.</p>
<p>Part of what is required is simply beefing up the U.S. diplomatic and intelligence presence in the region. This is a long-term effort, requiring training, rewards for deployment, and promotion of officers with expertise in this area. The military&rsquo;s effort with AFRICOM is one valuable step, and this should be encouraged. So too should similar efforts by the Joint Special Operations Command to work more with local officials. However, it is often cheaper and wins more friends if intelligence officials and diplomats, not soldiers, take the lead on many issues.</p>
<p>One tricky issue concerns the Algerian government. It is corrupt and brutal &ndash; and it is a strong candidate for revolution. Moreover, its intelligence services are shadowy and duplicitous. Despite all these problems, greater engagement is necessary because of Algeria&rsquo;s importance and the knowledge of the security services there. In addition, the United States is not likely to have a significant impact on the nature of the Algerian regime: because we have little leverage, an aggressive democracy promotion strategy could lose us cooperation but at the same time do little to help those who want better government in Algeria. However, the United States should lay the groundwork for better politics over time &ndash; supporting NGOs that seek to advance democracy and liberal values, promoting vocational education, and trying to bring Algerian society and its youth in particular in contact with the broader world.</p>
<p>Particularly important is hedging as we expand ties to the regime. This involves expanding the range of American contacts across government and society, consulting more with allies on joint policies, and trying to find alternative solutions to dependence on Algeria for key security issues (such as bases for U.S. drones). Such hedging allows the United States to protect its interests yet make clear to regime figures that the United States is not completely dependent on them. This both makes U.S. pressure more credible and leaves the United States in a better position to deal with the aftermath of succession or revolution.</p>
<p>More broadly, the United States will be working with weak governments like Mali and Libya as well as more established and stable ones like Morocco. Some of these governments, like Mali, will suffer coups or otherwise have unacceptable and anti-democratic practices. The United States, however, cannot simply drop its relations with regional states and then resume them a few years later when the dust settles. Although principled abstention plays well at home, in that interim we lose valuable intelligence and relationships. Steady contact and pressure to improve governance is often more useful than dramatic gestures that burn bridges but do little to help foster democracy.</p>
<p>Often the United States will need to rely more on regional allies, particularly France. U.S support for French military efforts in Mali, though grudging at first, was a valuable step given both France&rsquo;s historical ties and associated knowledge of the region and Paris&rsquo; willingness to act as the Mali problem metastasized. &nbsp;Given France&rsquo;s ties to other hotspots like Mali and Algeria, the United States should engage in serious contingency planning with France for the region to identify ways to burden share and otherwise take advantage of what each country has to offer. </p>
<p>Terrorism in and emanating from the Maghreb and Sahel regions, both of which threaten American lives and interests, will continue and may even grow in the years to come. The tragic attack in Benghazi and other subsequent terrorism in North Africa is not a reason to retreat. An effective response will require more local and regional partners, more cooperation with allies, more resources, and most of all a willingness to accept risk.</p>

<p>The manufacturing sector is one of the economy&rsquo;s most fundamental drivers, as evidenced by the instrumental role it has played in generating economic growth throughout the nation&rsquo;s history. Manufacturing is once again proving vital as it&rsquo;s been a significant factor in America&rsquo;s recovery from the Great Recession. In recent years, the federal government and private sector have introduced initiatives that seek to propel growth in American manufacturing, while also encouraging innovation in the sector. So, how successful have these policy efforts been? What does the future hold for American manufacturing? And how can U.S. institutions build on the momentum of a promising American manufacturing renaissance?</p>
<p>On July 10, Governance Studies at Brookings hosted a half-day conference focused on manufacturing and which policy ideas and reforms could best benefit workforce productivity and innovation in the sector. </p>
<p>Executives from Alcoa Inc. and Pfizer Inc. examined innovations that have occurred in their business, and discussed the challenges they face in maintaining a commitment to high quality products in a competitive industry that emphasizes volume and efficiency. They also addressed America&rsquo;s cultural emphasis on the importance of postsecondary education, noting that many manufacturing jobs do not require even a four-year degree.</p>

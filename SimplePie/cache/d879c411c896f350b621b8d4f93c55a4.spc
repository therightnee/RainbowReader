<p>In recent years, mobile technology has expanded dramatically around the world. For a fourth consecutive year, global mobile data traffic has doubled; between 2011 and 2016, it is expected to increase 18-fold. Furthermore, by the end of 2016, 10 billion mobile devices are projected to be in use around the world. Not surprisingly, the development of mobile technologies and applications has paralleled the proliferation of mobile use around the globe. </p>
<p>With increasing evidence of climate change,&nbsp;there has been a&nbsp;rise in the severity and frequency of tsunamis, flooding, drought, hurricanes, and tornados. Natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, the 2013 Oklahoma tornados, and the devastating 2011 drought in the Horn of Africa, are inflicting tremendous damage in terms of human life, injuries, and property damage. </p>
<p>There have also been numerous instances of recent civil unrest, criminal activity and terrorism, ranging from 9/11 to the Virginia Tech shootings to the 2013 Boston bombing. During this time period, the use of smart phones and tablets has become increasingly ubiquitous, with more people than ever turning to mobile applications for information. As a result, mobile development has surged in reaction to the rising demand for instant and accurate information. </p>
<p>In this paper, part of the Brookings Mobile Economy Project, Darrell West and Elizabeth Valentini examine how mobile technology assists in the creation of early warning systems, aids in emergency coordination, and improves public communications in times of crisis. West and Valentini advise policymakers to make better use of current mobile technologies and promote future advances to provide first responders and citizens with the tools necessary to save lives during threatening events. Governments and businesses alike should take full advantage of mobile technology to mitigate property damage, inform the public and save lives. </p><h4>

Technophobia is a psychological condition, but infectious. Hardly a week goes by without a new outbreak documented in another blog post or business column. To judge from the symptomatic hand-wringing the epidemic is spreading, we are on the verge of mass unemployment as work becomes increasingly automated. </p>
<p>Technophobia is an affliction we have yet to cure even after decades of evidence-based ameliorative efforts. We might not have expected much resistance to the disease in earlier times, before evidence accumulated that the fears it inspired were irrational. Back in 1930, a mind as brilliant as John Maynard Keynes was susceptible to the condition. Keynes sensed sickness in the air but misdiagnosed it as a feature of the capitalist economy: &ldquo;We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come&mdash;namely, technological unemployment.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Years of economic progress would thereafter reveal the misdiagnosis itself as the disease. The computer was invented and subsequently the fastest one increased in speed <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XvB1ZcsrDFAC">by a factor of 100,000</a>.&nbsp; <a href="http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/cromer/Spurious%20Volatility.pdf">Unemployment fell</a> to around five percent from 1930&rsquo;s nine percent. <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~wk2110/uncovering/">Median earnings doubled</a>. Yet a self-appointed committee of public intellectuals declared in a letter to the President that a &ldquo;cybernation revolution&rdquo; was at hand, the product of &ldquo;the combination of the computer and the automated self-regulating machine.&rdquo; The revolution was producing &ldquo;a system of almost unlimited productive capacity which requires progressively less human labor.&rdquo; <a href="http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/peace/papers/1964p.7-01.html">The year was 1964.</a></p>
<p>Between 1964 and 2007, on the eve of the Great Recession, the earnings of the median working-age male rose by about one-third, and while most of that came during the 1960s, <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2013/07/01-mens-rising-earnings">men&rsquo;s earnings did rise modestly after 1969</a>. Median earnings among female workers more than doubled after 1969. Median household income rose by about 75 percent. The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/10/art2full.pdf">typical age</a> at retirement <a href="http://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IB_11-11-508.pdf">declined</a>, and <a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/erik.hurst/research/leisure_sandiego.pdf">leisure time increased</a> among both working age men and women. Unemployment was no higher than five percent, even accounting for adults not included in official figures because they had stopped looking for work out of discouragement. The computing speed of the fastest computer rose by a factor of <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/21791.wss">one billion</a>. With a &ldquo;b&rdquo;. But we cannot shake technophobia. The sense remains that the next one-billion-fold increase in technological progress will be different.</p>
<p>Epidemiologists believe that technophobia&rsquo;s resiliency stems from an elevated susceptibility produced by another condition present in its hosts: excessive economic pessimism. Equally important is the frequent absence of prophylactic humility about the limits of imagination in predicting the future.</p>
<p>Take blogger Kevin Drum&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/print/223026">influential essay</a> from May of this year. Drum sees worrisome long-term declines in income, employment, and the share of national income going to workers. Resistant to evidence that such declines <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43373">either</a> <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2013/03/27-inequality-myths-winship">did not occur</a> or are <a href="http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2012/09/12/misunderstanding_declines_in_labor_force_participation_99874.html">not nearly so</a> <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w15351.pdf?new_window=1">worrisome</a> as he believes, Drum has proven easy prey for technophobia pathogens.</p>
<p>At the same time, with a bit more appreciation for our inability to foresee the ways in which tomorrow&rsquo;s world will differ from today&rsquo;s, those pathogens are easily fended off. Of the Luddites, early 19<sup>th</sup> century weavers who went on a spree smashing power looms out of fear that their adoption would doom workers to misery, Drum writes,</p>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 13px;">Power looms put them out of work, but in the long run automation made the entire workforce more productive. Everyone still had jobs&mdash;just different ones. Some ran the new power looms, <i>others found work no one could have imagined just a few decades before</i>, in steel mills, automobile factories, and railroad lines. (Emphasis added.)</span></blockquote>
<p>But we still can&rsquo;t imagine what work will look like in a few decades. In particular, people seem to resist the idea that if technology reduces demand for labor by a quarter, that might translate into <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/02/18/a-cheerful-welcome-to-the-robots-our-future-work-overlords/">everyone working 25 percent less</a> rather than unemployment rising by one-fourth. The late economic historian <a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0226256634">Robert Fogel</a> predicted that the increase in leisure between 1995 and 2040 would exceed the gain Americans saw in the 115 years before 1995.</p>
<p>Will Fogel be proven right? I certainly don&rsquo;t know. What I&rsquo;m pretty sure of, however, is that in 2040 we will not look back at 2013 and think, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made a huge mistake,&rdquo; ruing the day we failed to listen to those afflicted with technophobia. Technological progress is not a trick we have played on ourselves to throw ourselves into poverty. It is a means for fulfilling our material wants and needs and continues only to the extent that it does so.</p>
<p>Technophobia is pernicious not only because it needlessly distresses those it afflicts but because it distracts people from real economic problems that would be tractable if we could focus more narrowly on them. For an example of a productive look at technological change and its implications for workers, don&rsquo;t miss the new Third Way report, <a href="http://content.thirdway.org/publications/714/Dancing-With-Robots.pdf">&ldquo;Dancing with Robots,&rdquo;</a> by economists Frank Levy and Richard Murnane. Levy and Murnane are unconcerned about mass joblessness but argue that the subset of future workers who lack sophisticated skills to manage information will see stagnant or declining wages. </p>
<p>How big is this subset of workers? They do not say, but the less-skilled of their three categories of future jobs&mdash;those comprising &ldquo;non-routine manual tasks&rdquo;&mdash;corresponds closely with the &ldquo;low-wage&rdquo; category used by the Economic Policy Institute <a href="http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/webfac/moretti/e251_s13/mishel.pdf">in a recent paper</a> to analyze occupational changes. That paper finds that 18 percent of jobs are in occupations that tend to pay relatively poorly. In all five decades from 1950 to 2000, the share of workers in high-wage jobs rose faster than the share in low-wage jobs, but the pattern was reversed from 2000 to 2007.&nbsp; Levy and Murnane recommend a transformation of American education to equip more Americans with information-management skills. That seems a more productive course than loom-smashing or preparing for mass unemployment.</p><div>

	</div><a href="http://www.cvent.com/d/8cqh3q/4W">Register for the Event</a><br /><p><img style="width: 125px; float: left; height: 125px; margin-right: 10px;" alt="European Union Commissioner for Internal Market and Services Michel Barnier speaks at Brookings, July 15, 2013" src="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Events/2013/7/15 transatlantic cooperation financial reform/barnier/barnier_1x1.jpg" />On July 15, the Initiative on Business and Public Policy (IBPP) at the Brookings Institution hosted a discussion on the status of cooperation across the Atlantic on financial regulatory reform, featuring remarks by European Union Commissioner for Internal Market and Services Michel Barnier, who directs Europe&rsquo;s efforts. Commissioner Barnier presented his views on how best to accelerate progress towards genuine financial stability. Brookings Fellow Douglas Elliott hosted the discussion and moderated a question and answer period.</p>
<p>Barnier began his remarks by describing how the European Union and the United States came to an agreement about how to regulate cross-border swaps at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, three and a half years ago. This &ldquo;ambitious global regulatory reform of the swaps markets&rdquo; set out to do three strategic tasks:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Clearing:</strong> To reduce risk in our financial firms and system by clearing all standardized swaps through central counterparties.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> To shed light on this opaque market and report all trades to trade repositories. We need to know where risk is building up in the system.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Trading:</strong> Where appropriate, to move standardized swaps to venues to increase market transparency</li>
</ol>
<p>Barnier compared uncoordinated cross-border regulations between the United States and the European Union to &ldquo;squeezing a bar of soap with wet hands: it slips from your hands. Trades will be re-booked. Markets will fragment. The G20 reform objectives will not be met.&rdquo; Barnier noted that 70% of all global economic transactions take place between the United States and the European Union nations. For this reason, he argued that the United States and European Union need to &ldquo;lead by example&rdquo; by carrying out necessary economic reforms to meet G20 commitments &ldquo;rigorously and sensibly.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Barnier described the trade negotiations between the European Union and the United States that began last week as focused on &ldquo;growth and leadership,&rdquo; which are imperative to cultivating new jobs in each sovereign nation, as well as finding solutions to trade predicaments that cannot be found through multilateral discussions. Barnier argued that the &ldquo;barriers to EU-US trade and investment are in the details of regulatory policy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;regulatory barriers can block trade outright. Make it too expensive to be viable. Fragment global markets. Or just act as a drag on overall economic efficiency.&rdquo; Mitigating these barriers through regulatory reform will effectively protect the European Union and the U.S. economies from risks to their citizens and financial security.</p>
<p>To conclude his remarks, Barnier noted that the fundamental component of transatlantic trade reform is the joint leadership between the United States and the European Union. He believes &ldquo;our financial sectors know no borders. They are intertwined and interdependent.&rdquo; By reflecting on the agreement on swaps, Commissioner Barnier believes that the United States and European Union can create a dynamic bond that will &ldquo;raise the bar in tomorrow&rsquo;s world of financial regulation.&rdquo;</p><h4>

<p><i>Vital Statistics</i>&rsquo; purpose has always been to collect useful data on our first branch of government &ndash; in the election and composition of its membership as well as its formal procedure, such as the use of the filibuster, informal norms, party structure and staff. This dataset also documents the increasing polarization of Congress and the demographics of those who serve in the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Over the years, we&rsquo;ve received innumerable requests for updated versions of the chapters in between printings of the published book. We heard you and have now changed the way we present <em>Vital Statistics&rsquo;</em> data: We&rsquo;ve put the book online, making each chapter available online as a collection of spreadsheets for download at no cost. This new interactive format allows us to update and correct the data more frequently and make it accessible to anyone interested in learning about Congress. We&rsquo;ve formatted the tables so that each is both printer-friendly and read-writable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage you to share your feedback and how you&rsquo;ve used this data set; and we plan on posting your most interesting findings.&nbsp;<a href="http://connect.brookings.edu/vitalstats" target="_blank">Find out how you can submit your own Vital Stats analyses &raquo;</a> </p>

	<img src="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/images/e/ef%20ej/egypt_islamist001/egypt_islamist001_16x9.jpg?w=120" alt="Islamists holding a picture of Osama bin Laden chant pro-bin Laden and anti-American slogans in Cairo May 6, 2011" border="0" /><br /><p>On a clear night in early May 2011, US Navy seals found and killed Osama bin Laden in his hideout in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad. A secret Pakistani investigation of the operation, leaked to Al Jazeera, concludes that the operation was a "great humiliation" for Pakistan, the worst since the 1971 war with India. The US had carried out a "hostile military mission deep inside Pakistan" without informing Islamabad, and the Pakistani security establishment had no idea bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad, or in fact anywhere in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Based on months of investigation by a four-man tribunal led by a former Supreme Court judge, the report's conclusions are at once predictable and startling. No individual is signaled out for blame. No names of those guilty are mentioned. After interviewing over 200 individuals, including bin Laden family members and senior ISI intelligence officers, however, the commission concludes the events of May 2011 were not a "stand-alone failure" of the ISI, the army or even the government. Rather, they are indicative of a society and especially an elite that is both incompetent and penetrated by extremist jihadis. The failure to find bin Laden is placed directly on ISI, which at best was guilty of an "extent of incompetence, which to put it mildly, was astonishing, if not unbelievable" or at worse "a grave complicity" at levels of command the commission could not identify. The failure to detect the US intelligence operations in Abbottabad that preceded the seal raid, or to react to the raid itself until it was over, are blamed on a security bureaucracy that the commission concludes needs massive and systematic restructuring. In short, it is a devastating report, which is probably why Pakistan has yet to officially release it, six months after it was finished.</p>
<p><strong>On the move</strong></p>
<p>High value target number one, bin Laden, was surrounded by his family in the Abbottabad villa he was hiding in for six years. Three of his wives, eight of his children and five of his grandchildren were with him. According to the report, he fled Afghanistan's Tora Bora in late 2001 and moved to the Pakistani city of Kohat, near Peshawar, where his family joined him. They had hidden in Karachi after 9/11, and then moved to the Swat Valley, where bin Laden met with Khalid Sheikh Muhammad (KSM), the tactical mastermind of the 9/11 plot, at least once. KSM was captured by CIA in Pakistan's military capital Rawalpindi on March 1, 2003, inside a closed military zone, less than a mile from the Army General Headquarter. They had not told ISI they were looking for KSM when they staged the raid. The capture prompted bin Laden to move to Haripur for two years while a special hideout was built for him in Abbottabad. Other bin Laden family members joined him there over time.</p>
<p>He moved into his new hideout in August 2005. Abbottabad is just 30 miles north of the country's capital, Islamabad, and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Rawalpindi, on the famous Karakoram Highway that follows the ancient Silk Road from South Asia over the Himalayas and Hindu Kush to China. It is also home to Pakistan's premier Kakul military academy, which was less than a mile from bin Laden's compound.</p>
<p>Abbottabad is named after British army officer and colonial administrator Sir James Abbott, who founded the city as a British army cantonment in January 1853. Abbott fought in the British East India Company's wars against the Sikhs in the middle of the 19th century and was very fond of the city he founded. Apparently, so was bin Laden.</p>
<p>The CIA traced him there by following the trail of Abu Ahmed al Kuwaiti, his Pakistani courier, who had worked with bin Laden in planning the 9/11 attacks and was his emissary to the outside world. Al Kuwaiti was a Pakistani Pashtun tribesman born and raised in Kuwait, who spoke fluent Arabic and Pashto and could move between two cultures easily. In 2010, US intelligence community traced him to Abbottabad and a three-storey house that seemed different from most other homes in the city. It was surrounded by an 18-ft-high wall topped by barbed wire, had no electronic signatures (phone or Internet), and seemed custom-built to hide someone. Screens and interior walls blocked vision into the compound from outside. The Pakistani commission found it to be a "very peculiar design".</p>
<p><strong>No Evidence For Complicity</strong></p>
<p>The Pakistani commission closely examined the construction of the safehouse from 2003 on. It discovered that it was the result of "a whole series of illegal and irregular transactions based on false documents and false identities" that should have attracted the attention of local authorities and ISI. The commission is justly mystified that "the entire neighbourhood, local officials, police and security and intelligence officials all missed the size, the strange shape, the barbed wire, the lack of cars and visitors, etc etc, over a period of six years," an incompetence that "beggars belief". It does not rule out complicity by some isi elements but says it was unable to find any hard evidence.</p>
<p>The commission concludes al Qaeda practised good tradecraft in concealing its leader's hideout for six years. But bin Laden could not hide without a support network beyond al Kuwaiti and his brother. Phone numbers found in the house by the seal team suggest al Kuwaiti was in touch with a terrorist group, which, as laid out in The New York Times in a June 2011 report, was Harkat ul Mujahideen, with whom bin Laden had worked since at least the late 1990s. It was created in the 1980s by isi to fight India, and has loyally worked with it for decades. Its leader, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, lives openly in an Islamabad suburb.</p>
<p>The report is not as specific as the Times one, but it also concludes that al Kuwaiti and his cell were "embedded in an enabling environment" of the Pakistani jihadi community that facilitated their activity and assisted the hideout. It recommends that Pakistan investigate as a "matter of great concern if this "environment" included ISI personnel.</p>
<p><strong>A Question With No Answers</strong></p>
<p>The report is right to focus on the issue of the larger environment. Al Qaeda does not operate in Pakistan in a vacuum, but because it has a friendly environment. Bin Laden's allies were men like Lashkar-e-Toiba leader Hafeez Saeed and Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Both remain close allies of ISI. The commission rightly concludes that the problem is deeply entrenched in the country's history. It says "the dark era of General Zia-ul-Haq left Pakistan with a poisoned legacy of a criminal, violent, ideological and anti-national infrastructure of extremism".</p>
<p>American presidents since Bill Clinton have been warning Pakistan that harbouring and patronising terror would sooner or later lead to disaster. It has, and Pakistan is now a daily victim of the Frankenstein Zia created. The commission notes that US-Pakistani relations have been "on a roller coaster" since they began in the 1940s but reached a nadir in 2011. It concludes that from its start, the Obama administration did not trust ISI and the army leadership. The commission devotes a para to studying the works of this author on Pakistan, citing my line that Pakistan is "the most dangerous country in the world" as evidence of Obama's deep distrust of the generals.</p>
The tone of the bilateral relationship has improved somewhat since 2011, but the substance has not. The commission's report reminds us that we still don't have a good answer to the central mystery of Abbottabad--how did the most wanted man in history hide in the front yard of the Pakistani army for six years undetected? The report puts the burden primarily on ISI's "gross incompetence" but doesn't rule out the possibility of complicity. Perhaps we'll never know, but the commission report is a useful and important addition to the search for an answer.<div>

These 10 traits below have proven to be particularly strong determinants of a metro area&rsquo;s ability to succeed in global markets, manage the negative consequences of globalization, and better secure its desired economic future.&nbsp;This week's post expands on trait 3 &ndash; Specializations with Global Reach.. </i></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Last week,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2013/07/11/us-department-commerce-exports-50-us-metropolitan-areas-topped-1-tril" target="_blank">the U.S. Department of Commerce released&nbsp;new data</a> showing that 29 metro areas hit record export levels in 2012.&nbsp; Regional leaders need to treat this piece of news as more than arcane trade data at the margins of regional economic strategies.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Instead, &ldquo;industry specializations with a global reach,&rdquo; one key <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2013/06/26-global-metro-traits-mcdearman-clark-parilla">trait of globally fluent metro areas</a>, must be at the heart of broader regional plans to boost global economic competitiveness.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">The good news is that the best economic development professionals understand that traded sectors drive regional economic growth by drawing incomes from businesses and consumers in other markets.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Yet, too many regions still cling to an era where U.S. metro areas could fuel their economies by trading within America&rsquo;s large and dependable domestic market. Greater Kansas City could sell their specializations in financial services or wireless communications to nearby Denver and Chicago and thrive. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">A brutal U.S. recession and the rise of a powerful global consumer class have shattered that assumption. Simple math reveals the imperative for U.S. metros to extend their specializations globally.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/features/30_trillion_decathlon" target="_blank">McKinsey&nbsp;estimates that customers in emerging markets</a> will consume $30 trillion in goods and services by 2025, up from $12 trillion in 2010.&nbsp;The regions and sectors that ignore the expansion of global demand will likely lose market share and the very economic value that protects and adds jobs and opportunities at home. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Indeed, the new reality is that traded sectors must be exchanged worldwide if metro areas hope to successfully compete and prosper in today&rsquo;s global marketplace. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">So, what does it mean to nurture &ldquo;specializations with a global reach&rdquo;?</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">First, it is about exporting.&nbsp; While the new Commerce data showed promising trends in metro goods exports, the reality is that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/02/11-export-trade-accelerator-liu" target="_blank">86 out of the 100 largest metro areas</a> still underperform the nation in the share of their economy driven by international sales.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2012/08/metro-exports-guide" target="_blank">Metro areas need to proactively work</a> with firms, service providers, universities, and other government and civic partners to help firms in their traded sectors enter international sales for the first time or to expand their sales to additional global markets. Regions like Portland, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Los Angeles, and Central New York have&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/state-metro-innovation/mei#currentmetropolitanexportplans" target="_blank">active metro export strategies underway</a> to grow jobs and boost incomes. These regions are demonstrating they have a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2013/02/11%20export%20trade%20accelerator%20liu/export%20trade%20accelerator%20liu" target="_blank">unique and critical role to play</a> in bringing firms into the export game and creating the overall ecosystem for global engagement</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">&ldquo;Specializations with a global reach&rdquo; is also about inbound investment.&nbsp;Regional leaders already have business recruitment strategies down pat.&nbsp;But in the future, metro areas must be more strategic in aligning foreign direct investment (FDI) with key specializations and integrating it with export strategies.&nbsp;A Brookings report on FDI in 100 U.S. markets will be released this fall.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Internationalizing specializations also helps firms and metros stay at the cutting edge of their fields. Global markets act as a natural selection mechanism in that only the most competitive sell beyond their home market. Firms that export find themselves adapting products and services to different global preferences, perfecting niche products, and improving time-to-market to better meet the demands of international customers. As they gain market share, firms acquire the resources to invest in <a href="http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.26.2.91" target="_blank">next generation products and processes</a>. In this way, going global helps keep regional specializations competitive or, if necessary, guide metros into new specializations (i.e. <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Multimedia/Interactives/2013/tentraits/San_Jose.pdf">Silicon Valley&rsquo;s evolution from semiconductors to software to social media</a>). </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Some regional leaders believe that global trade and investment is an activity best fit for coastal metros like Seattle and Miami or financial giants like New York that naturally think and act globally.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s exactly the mindset that will relegate regions to flyover status or third-tier market status.&nbsp;The reality is that all metro areas, regardless of size and location, can and must engage globally.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Consider these markets playing on the global stage. <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Multimedia/Interactives/2013/tentraits/Wichita.pdf" target="_blank">Wichita</a>, a region of just over 600,000, concentrates 32 times as much aerospace manufacturing employment as the rest of the country. Aircraft and parts built in Wichita are sold all over the world by Bombardier, Cessna, Hawker Beechcraft, and Airbus, and nearly 60 percent of Wichita&rsquo;s exports derive from its aerospace cluster. The same can be said for interior metros like <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Multimedia/Interactives/2013/tentraits/Minneapolis_Saint_Paul.pdf" target="_blank">Minneapolis</a>&rsquo;s medical devices cluster or <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2012/3/08exports/profiles/metros/Indianapolis.pdf" target="_blank">Indianapolis</a>&rsquo;s unique niche in chemicals. Similarly, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Multimedia/Interactives/2013/tentraits/Greenville.pdf" target="_blank">Greenville-Spartanburg</a> area attracted more FDI per capita than any other U.S. region. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">To be globally fluent is not simply about cultural literacy. The traded sectors that form a regional economy must themselves have international reach.&nbsp;And by going global, those specializations will only adapt and strengthen, solidifying a region&rsquo;s place and dynamism on the global map.</p><div>

<p>Chairmen Poe and Ros-Lehtinen, Ranking Members Sherman and Deutch, distinguished members of the subcommittees and staff, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am honored to be here to express my views. I am also humbled to be here on the panel with Michael Lovelady. Please know that my thoughts go out to him and the other relatives of those Americans who have died in Algeria and from other terrorist attacks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The terrorist attacks in Benghazi that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans have received exhaustive coverage, yet many of the long-term implications have not been fully considered. Future attacks, particularly those in North Africa, are likely to involve a Benghazi-style mix of jihadists of different nationalities, making it difficult to determine exactly who is responsible. Libya remains troubled, and the broader Maghreb and Sahel areas are unstable. Greater state weakness, not more stability, is likely in the years to come. So similar plots may be in our future.</p>
<p>I believe the U.S. reaction to the Benghazi attack, however, is likely to leave us less prepared for future terrorism. U.S. knowledge of Libya and the region has always been limited. Unfortunately, the political and bureaucratic lesson of Benghazi is clear &ndash; avoid risks at all costs. American diplomats and spies will be more confined to well-guarded parts of capital cities and more removed from local populations. This will keep them safer, but U.S. intelligence is likely to decline, and U.S. statecraft to diminish. In the long-run, diminishing U.S. capabilities could pose a grave danger to U.S. security, increasing the risk of a surprise attack or a regional development that catches the United States unawares. In addition, jihadists may point to any U.S. retreat after Benghazi as proof of U.S. cowardice.</p>
<p>The United States should bolster, not draw down, its presence in North Africa. America has important interests in the region and in any case the threats will not disappear simply because the U.S. chooses to ignore them. The region is now an important arena for jihadists, and the size of their area of operation is growing. In addition, jihadists from the region and weapons from Libya are showing up in places like Syria and Sinai. </p>
<p>We should seek to understand and engage regional governments and peoples to counter the threats that emanate from North Africa. To this end, Washington should maintain a robust and energetic intelligence and diplomatic presence, even in dangerous countries or ones that suffer from governments that reject democratic practices. Because the operating environment is risky, the United States should augment and systematize its rapid response capabilities and its post-attack procedures. In addition, Washington should ado<a name="_GoBack"></a>pt a more regional response to the terrorism threat, work more with allies like France to prepare for contingencies, and increase overall intelligence and diplomatic attention to the Maghreb and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The remainder of my testimony has three parts. First, I briefly discuss the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and assess what it means for the state of Al Qaeda today. Second, I discuss future challenges in the Maghreb, including Algeria as well as Libya, from a counterterrorism point of view. Third, I present implications and recommendations for the United States.</p>
<p><strong>I. The Benghazi Attack and the State of Al Qaeda</strong></p>
<p>The Benghazi attack exhibited several characteristics that are likely to manifest in future terrorist attacks in the Maghreb region. The attacks were:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Of Limited Sophistication</em></strong>. In contrast to the years of planning that went into the 9/11 attacks and other terrorism &ldquo;spectaculars,&rdquo; the attackers in Benghazi used military methods suggesting basic coordination and training but not more cutting-edge methods. The weapons used &ndash; RPGs, AK-47s, heavy machine guns and artillery mounted on trucks, and so on &ndash; are not advanced and are widely available. Many fighters from Al Qaeda, associated movements, and jihadist local organizations have these skills and similar weapons. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>Not Tied to Particular Events</strong></em>. Although some initial reports suggested that the attackers used the &ldquo;Innocence of Muslims&rdquo; video and associated demonstrations as justification, subsequent information makes clear this was at most a pretext. The United States was supporting efforts of the government of Libya to consolidate control over the eastern part of the country, but there was no single identifiable U.S. government action at the time that drew the ire of local terrorists: rather local jihadists simply wanted to attack U.S. personnel and facilities and did so. Even assuming the video in question mattered, there will always be similar pretexts that terrorist groups can cite to justify their attacks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Continued Vulnerability of Diplomatic Facilities</em></strong>. Diplomatic facilities, like military forces and civil aviation, remain a constant source of targeting interest for jihadist attackers. Between1998 and 2011 there were 13 deadly attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities, most of which were linked to Al Qaeda, associated movements, or those who share aspects of its ideology. There were also innumerable attempted attacks and plots that were abandoned because of effective intelligence and defensive measures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>Not a Reflection of Al Qaeda Popularity</strong></em>. Extremist Islamist movements are not particularly strong and popular in the Maghreb. In Algeria in particular they are less popular than they were in the 1990s. Rather, as discussed below, these groups take advantage of weak governments and a chaotic operating environment more than they depend on public support. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>Not Linked to U.S. Popularity</strong></em>. Some polls showed Libyans in general to be the most pro-American of all Arab states, with eastern Libya in particularly having a favorable view of Americans due to the prominent American role in helping the Libyan revolution defeat Qaddafi&rsquo;s forces.[1] Although foreigners and foreign influence are unpopular in parts of Libya and the United States is seen as supporting some factions over others, only a minority of Libyans supported the attacks, and only a minority of a minority was actively involved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>A Mix of Groups and Individuals</strong></em>. It does not appear that the Al Qaeda core orchestrated the Benghazi attack, and the assault shows how the core has spawned a variety of lesser but lethal movements. The attack involved individuals from multiple groups, making it difficult to narrow responsibility even months after the attack. In addition to Libya itself groups and factions from Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, and Algeria all seem to have been involved.[2] This sort of networked coordination, where like-minded individuals from different organizations cooperate in limited ways, is typical of Al Qaeda and associated movements as well as individuals who share no formal affiliation with the mother movement but embrace parts of its ideology.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Nature and Limits of Al Qaeda-Type Groups in the Maghreb</strong></p>
<p>Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and other groups in the region are capable of massive violence, even by the standards of the broader Al Qaeda-linked movements. During the 1990s, the Algerian civil war saw unspeakable horrors against civilians. According to Canadian diplomat Robert Fowler, who was kidnapped by AQIM, the terrorists whom he came to know were far more impressed with the late Iraqi leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who personally beheaded captives and favored bloody attacks on fellow Muslims who would not support his leadership, over the (relatively) more muted and anti-Western approach favored by Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.<a name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The various organizations in the Maghreb are divided but not necessarily hostile to one another. Many are linked in one way or another to AQIM, whose key leaders are Algerian but whose membership includes a wider range of individuals from around the region. Although AQIM has many splinters, the splinters often work together, cooperating on attacks, kidnappings, and other operations. </p>
<p>Al Qaeda affiliates and local organizations, like Ansar al-Sharia embrace some of Al Qaeda&rsquo;s rhetoric, but they are not under Zawahiri&rsquo;s thumb and many have little direct organizational relationship. &nbsp;The core organization under Bin Ladin, and now Zawahiri, used to bring people under its banner because it could offer money and useful services like training camps. Both these incentives have been diminished.<a name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> Affiliates and local groups often disagree with core leadership on a wide variety of issues, ranging from target prioritization to the degree and types of civilians who might be attacked. To the disappointment of al-Qaeda&rsquo;s core leadership, AQIM leaders have not tried hard to mobilize supporters in Europe on behalf of global jihad and have not brought the &ldquo;war&rdquo; to the Continent.<a name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> As Jean-Pierre Filiu comments, AQIM &ldquo;is the branch of the global jihad that has most clearly failed to follow its founding guidelines.&rdquo;<a name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>In addition, the highly effective U.S. drone campaign has not only removed key Al Qaeda core leaders but has also made it far harder for them to communicate with one another and exercise command over the broader jihadist movement. A tip sheet found among jihadists in Mali advised militants to avoid drones by maintaining &ldquo;complete silence of all wireless contacts,&rdquo; to &ldquo;avoid gathering in open areas,&rdquo; noting that leaders &ldquo;should not use communications equipment,&rdquo; and taking strenuous measures to root out spies, among other suggestions.<a name="_ftnref7" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> The implications for group effectiveness are staggering. In essence group leaders cannot lead as they must hide or remain incommunicado. Training on a large-scale is hard if not impossible, as large gatherings can be lethal. In combat, they cannot mass or bring in significant reinforcements. In other words, the drones turn al-Qa&rsquo;ida&rsquo;s command and control structure into a liability, forcing it to have no leaders or risk dead leaders.</p>
<p>The bad news is that affiliates themselves are filling the void created by the weakness of the core. For years Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was a strong and powerful force that influenced other jihadist groups. AQIM is trying to play that role in the Maghreb, working as we have seen with groups in Libya and Mali, and expanding ties to Nigeria&rsquo;s Boko Haram.</p>
<p>Al Qaeda and its allies are likely to see the U.S. response to the Benghazi attack as a victory and proof of America&rsquo;s cowardice. Bin Ladin had long claimed that the United States hid behind defenses and technology and pointed to U.S. withdrawals from Lebanon and Somalia after terrorist attacks as &ldquo;proof&rdquo; that the United States will fold if hit hard. The U.S. retreat from Benghazi and the handwringing in the United States risk encouraging the jihadist perception that the United States has not changed even after 9/11.</p>
<p><strong>II. Future Counterterrorism Challenges in the Maghreb </strong></p>
<p>Beyond the specific implications for Al Qaeda and associated movements in the Maghreb, the United States is likely to find counterterrorism more difficult because of the high level of instability in the region and the difficulty of working with key partners like Algeria. </p>
<p><strong>The Spread of Instability</strong></p>
<p>A functional Libyan state has never really existed. Qaddafi, rather than building one, ruled through fear and vision. Enabled by its vast hydrocarbon wealth, the Libyan economy was top-down, never allowing the private sector and an independent middle class to develop. </p>
<p>The stability of Libya today has not fundamentally changed since the September 11, 2012 attacks: anarchy does not reign complete, but neither has the government consolidated power. Since the revolution the country has had successful elections, and its economy has recovered reasonably though oil exports still remain less than pre-revolutionary levels. Islam and some sense of Libyan identity are unifying forces. In addition, Libya&rsquo;s neighbors &ndash; in contrast, to say, Syria&rsquo;s &ndash; have not actively intervened to back one faction over another. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the state still does not function: the army, the police, the judiciary, and other basic security institutions are weak and politicized.<a name="_ftnref8" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Armed gangs and militias, some of which reflect tribal or regional forces and others leftovers from the revolution, remain active almost two years of the revolution. The militias vary in type, legitimacy, and size: some have revolutionary legitimacy and local support; others are criminals masquerading as community defenders. The country lacks an effective judicial system, so militias rather than the police or authorized officials arrest those suspected of crimes, run prisons, and otherwise offer a form of rough justice.<a name="_ftnref9" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> When powerful sub-state actors oppose any particular government action, they simply seize the ministry or surround the Congress and force the government to acquiesce. These militias are both the source of many problems, particularly the lack of government authority and legitimacy, and a reflection of them. Libyan institutions and security forces remain weak and discredited, so people turn to militias; because militias are strong, Libya&rsquo;s state remains weak. On balance conflicts in Libya are limited, but they are not moving toward resolution. Because of this weakness, the Libyan state has not consolidated power in much of the country and is unable to disarm or crush groups like Ansar al-Sharia. This includes much of eastern Libya, but also much of the southern desert regions. </p>
<p>Libya is ripe for homegrown terrorists and foreign terrorist penetration. The Al Qaeda core has long included Libyans in its ranks and reportedly dispatched operatives to build an organization in the post-Qaddafi era. Jihadists of various stripes were released from jail, and some returned to Libya from exile. Homegrown groups like Ansar Al-Sharia have found room to operate. In addition, the Libyan civil war has opened up Qaddafi&rsquo;s vast arsenals to Libyan groups, and Libyan weapons have found their way not only to its neighbors like Mali but also to Gaza, Sinai, and even Syria.<a name="_ftnref10" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>More broadly, the Maghreb and the Sahel region are highly unstable. Two of Libya&rsquo;s neighbors, Egypt and Tunisia, have undergone dramatic regime changes in recent years, and at the date of this testimony Egypt&rsquo;s future course is anyone&rsquo;s guess. Sudan recently saw the secession of its southern region while other parts of the country clamor for independence. Nigeria and Mali suffer civil wars. Chad is poor, corrupt, and plagued by coups and has suffered several dramatic terrorist attacks in recent months. Borders in the Maghreb are porous. Part of this is geographic and historical &ndash; various tribes have long had economic and kinship ties that transcend borders &ndash; but the biggest problem is government weakness. So even if one country is adopting policies that make it stronger, it can still suffer violence emanating from its neighbors.</p>
<p>Not only does instability in one regional state affect its neighbors, but the Maghreb in general is an exporter of radicalism. A recent Washington Institute for Near East Policy study found Tunisia and Libya &ndash; more even than traditional producers of radicals like Saudi Arabia &ndash; was a source of suicide bombers for the Syrian conflict.<a name="_ftnref11" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> So the United States cannot write off this region in the hope that its trouble will remain geographically confined. </p>
<p><strong>Algerian Dilemmas</strong></p>
<p>The only strong regime in the region is Algeria &ndash; and the United States knows relatively little about this country and has at best a lukewarm relationship with its government. Algerians are the core of AQIM, and the government runs the most extensive spy network in the region: so we must look to Algeria to get at both the problem and the solution. Algeria was more pro-Soviet than pro-American in the Cold War, and it is prickly about its independence. Part of this is because of the secretive nature of the Algerian regime. However, Algeria has not been an intelligence or diplomatic priority. Algeria has long bristled at many cooperation requests, though intelligence cooperation did improve after 9/11 and is now far better. However, from an intelligence point of view, the Algerian government has a history of manipulating opposition groups, including violent terrorists, making it difficult to trust the information it provides. In particular, there are rumors that Algerian intelligence has worked with Iyad Ag Ghali, the head of Ansar al-Dine in Mali, and also with Mukhtar Belmukhtar. The Algerian government seeks to divert these groups against other targets and divide the movement, but in doing so it is playing with fire.<a name="_ftnref12" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Despite its relative strength, Algeria&rsquo;s own stability is in question. Predicting social revolution is notoriously difficult, but Algeria seems ripe for dramatic change. Algeria has resisted the Arab spring so far: the regime&rsquo;s ruthless and effective repression, its ability to coopt potential rivals, and the memory of a horrific civil war that left an estimated 200,000 dead in the 1990s have dissuaded citizens from taking to the streets in large numbers. However, with neighbors like Tunisia and Libya in the throes of change, a stagnant economy, a large youth population, and a government with weak legitimacy, mass protests could sweep Algeria. In particular, the recent stroke of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, though his role was largely to offer a fa&ccedil;ade for military rule, could foster a succession question that leads Algerians to demand more serious change &ndash; this may occur even before the scheduled 2014 Presidential elections. What the future holds is unclear: the United States must be prepared for revolution, instability, or continued rule by the military and security services.</p>
<p><strong>III. Implications and Recommendations for the United States</strong></p>
<p>The aftermath of the Benghazi attack and subsequent events in North Africa suggest four areas in which the United States must improve: bolstering <em>local </em>intelligence and diplomacy, augmenting apid reaction capabilities, making foreign policy reflect regional as well as state-focused concerns, and increasing overall attention to the Maghreb and surrounding areas.</p>
<p><strong>Local Intelligence and Diplomacy</strong></p>
<p>Better intelligence and good local relations are important for keeping Americans safe in different parts in the world and in the U.S. homeland. It is impossible to quantify the benefits derived, but better intelligence allows numerous plots to be disrupted, and better relations reduces hostility to the United States and improves cooperation when trying to disrupt attacks or manage their consequences. Trying to improve intelligence and relations, however, will put those Americans charged with gathering intelligence and improving relations at more risk.</p>
<p>That Benghazi was dangerous was well-known to all. Before the September 11 attack, an IED breached the U.S. consulate in Benghazi&rsquo;s perimeter. The International Committee of the Red Cross, in general a bold organization, had suspended operations there before the attack that killed Ambassador Stevens. There had been attacks on the British ambassador and on the Tunisian embassy. Other diplomats and foreign citizens were kidnapped or attacked. Indeed, the presence of terrorism was the reason for such a large intelligence presence in Benghazi.</p>
<p>Ambassador Stevens knew Libya and Benghazi well. He was popular among Libyans and his worry about the dangerous security environment in Benghazi stemmed in part from this knowledge. During my time as a staff member of the 9/11 Commission and for the House and Senate joint committee investigating 9/11, we constantly pushed for a CIA and a State Department that was more expeditionary and willing to take risks &ndash; in short, we wanted more people with the courage, experience, skill, and mindset of Ambassador Stevens. His loss was a great tragedy for our country.</p>
<p>The U.S. reaction to his death, however, risks putting undue constraints on American intelligence and diplomacy. These will ultimately undermine rather than protect U.S. interests abroad and safety at home. The bureaucratic and political lesson of Benghazi is to further confine American diplomats and spies in well-guarded parts of a capital city and remove them even more from the local population. This will keep them safer, but it will also make them less effective. They will not mingle with the local population and learn their concerns and gain their support (indeed, a recent attempted attack on Italian diplomats in Libya was foiled by an alert and supportive Libyan citizen).<a name="_ftnref13" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> They will be less able to gather intelligence on local groups. They will not take risks. And America will be less able to stop terrorism and secure its interests.</p>
<p>The United States will also become more dependent on foreign governments to provide intelligence. At times, reliance on foreign governments is beneficial &ndash; even ideal. In Morocco, for example, the local intelligence service is skilled and an important partner of the United States. In Algeria, however, the intelligence service is often suspicious of close cooperation with the United States. In countries like Libya and Mali, the intelligence services are weak and do not have access to or extensive sources in much of their countries. In such cases the United States needs to develop its own sources.</p>
<p>In Sudan, the United States closed its embassy in 1996 due to the high risk of a terrorist attack. &nbsp;From a force protection perspective, this made sense: the danger was quite real. It also meant, however, the United States lost valuable intelligence on a nascent Al Qaeda and was unable to recognize important shifts in the attitude of the government of Sudan toward counterterrorism cooperation. In the long-term the loss of this information may have cost American lives. Cutting and running from places like Benghazi may lead to similar losses.</p>
<p>The United States still needs to deploy diplomats and spies in danger zones. In many ways, they are America&rsquo;s first line of defense, learning about problems before they are apparent in Washington and cultivating assets to handle them. In addition, the United States needs local access after any attack. As the problems the FBI has incurred in its Benghazi investigation suggest, the government in Tripoli cannot ensure access to the scene of the attack and other important investigative needs. Washington also needs local sources to learn more about the identity of the attackers and possible follow-on attacks.</p>
<p>The Obama administration and the U.S. Congress &ndash; including the leadership of both parties &ndash; should make it clear that &ldquo;failures&rdquo; like Benghazi will be scrutinized, but also that we should expect losses when diplomats and spies operate in remote parts of unstable countries about which we know little where terrorist groups are also active. Surprise, mistakes, and bureaucratic confusion will be inevitable, and risk-taking should be rewarded over a caution that leaves the United States blinded, uninformed, and with few local friends as trouble develops.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid Reaction Standardization</strong></p>
<p>It would have been difficult for outside forces to have rescued Ambassador Stevens and his colleagues given the ferocity and rapid nature of the attack. And, in general, tactical warning is usually absent when it comes to terrorist attacks. One of the responses to this lack of tactical warning was to improve the defenses at U.S. embassies &ndash; the so-called &ldquo;Inman guidelines.&rdquo;<a name="_ftnref14" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> Although U.S. defenses are far from foolproof, they have saved many lives as terrorist groups have been foiled or have moved on to other targets.</p>
<p>The United States must improve its ability to respond rapidly to unexpected terrorist attacks like the Benghazi assault. Anticipating the type of motley medley of groups and individuals involved in Benghazi is difficult. Moreover, given the unsure security situation in Libya &ndash; and problems facing the United States elsewhere in the region given government weakness and limits on intelligence &ndash; we should expect regular surprises from groups and cells of which we were previously unaware.</p>
<p>In some cases even careful advanced preparation will matter little, but in others it may prove the difference between life and death. In April 2013, the Pentagon announced that the U.S. Marines had developed a rapid reaction force for North Africa that could quickly deploy 500 Marines within 12 hours.<a name="_ftnref15" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> &nbsp;This is impressive progress, but the time window needs to be smaller. This may involve deploying a smaller force &ndash; again, which means incurring more risk &ndash; but this could save many lives while enabling more expeditionary U.S. intelligence and diplomacy. Nevertheless, we must move away from the idea that spies and diplomats will have absolute protection. Even spending vast amounts of money to improve rapid reaction will still leave U.S. officials vulnerable if they are aggressively gathering information and trying to win over locals as they should be.</p>
<p><strong>A Regional Response</strong></p>
<p>U.S. diplomacy in North Africa and the Sahel area is still divided by country, and in some cases by geographic divisions (&ldquo;Near East&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Africa&rdquo;). There is no ideal bureaucratic organization that perfectly balances state-specific concerns with ones that cross borders like terrorism, but in general U.S. bureaucracies are not well coordinated across regional lines. But terrorist groups from Algeria operate in Libya, what happens in Libya shapes Mali, and what happened in Mali contributed to terrorist attacks in Algeria and Niger. Although the terrorism problem crosses borders, different ambassadors have different policies regarding counterterrorism efforts. North Africa and the Sahel region tend to be separate bureaucratically even though many of their problems are linked. The U.S. military has steadily developed and expanded regional bodies like AFRICOM to meet this challenge. Intelligence and diplomatic structures need to follow suit.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prioritizing the Maghreb and Surrounding Areas</strong></p>
<p>Often with justification, the United States has not made Algeria, Libya, Mali, and other states in the region priorities. Historic ties are limited, their energy supplies were not under threat, and their role in issues such as the Arab-Israeli dispute was marginal.</p>
<p>With the spread of Al Qaeda-focused international terrorism, however, the balance of interests has changed. The region itself is now an important theater of jihad, with AQIM playing a regional role and numerous smaller groups showing up elsewhere in the several countries. Even worse, as the Syrian civil war indicates, the region is now an exporter of terror, with volunteers from the Maghreb and weapons from Libya showing up many miles away.</p>
<p>Part of what is required is simply beefing up the U.S. diplomatic and intelligence presence in the region. This is a long-term effort, requiring training, rewards for deployment, and promotion of officers with expertise in this area. The military&rsquo;s effort with AFRICOM is one valuable step, and this should be encouraged. So too should similar efforts by the Joint Special Operations Command to work more with local officials. However, it is often cheaper and wins more friends if intelligence officials and diplomats, not soldiers, take the lead on many issues.</p>
<p>One tricky issue concerns the Algerian government. It is corrupt and brutal &ndash; and it is a strong candidate for revolution. Moreover, its intelligence services are shadowy and duplicitous. Despite all these problems, greater engagement is necessary because of Algeria&rsquo;s importance and the knowledge of the security services there. In addition, the United States is not likely to have a significant impact on the nature of the Algerian regime: because we have little leverage, an aggressive democracy promotion strategy could lose us cooperation but at the same time do little to help those who want better government in Algeria. However, the United States should lay the groundwork for better politics over time &ndash; supporting NGOs that seek to advance democracy and liberal values, promoting vocational education, and trying to bring Algerian society and its youth in particular in contact with the broader world.</p>
<p>Particularly important is hedging as we expand ties to the regime. This involves expanding the range of American contacts across government and society, consulting more with allies on joint policies, and trying to find alternative solutions to dependence on Algeria for key security issues (such as bases for U.S. drones). Such hedging allows the United States to protect its interests yet make clear to regime figures that the United States is not completely dependent on them. This both makes U.S. pressure more credible and leaves the United States in a better position to deal with the aftermath of succession or revolution.</p>
<p>More broadly, the United States will be working with weak governments like Mali and Libya as well as more established and stable ones like Morocco. Some of these governments, like Mali, will suffer coups or otherwise have unacceptable and anti-democratic practices. The United States, however, cannot simply drop its relations with regional states and then resume them a few years later when the dust settles. Although principled abstention plays well at home, in that interim we lose valuable intelligence and relationships. Steady contact and pressure to improve governance is often more useful than dramatic gestures that burn bridges but do little to help foster democracy.</p>
<p>Often the United States will need to rely more on regional allies, particularly France. U.S support for French military efforts in Mali, though grudging at first, was a valuable step given both France&rsquo;s historical ties and associated knowledge of the region and Paris&rsquo; willingness to act as the Mali problem metastasized. &nbsp;Given France&rsquo;s ties to other hotspots like Mali and Algeria, the United States should engage in serious contingency planning with France for the region to identify ways to burden share and otherwise take advantage of what each country has to offer. </p>
<p>Terrorism in and emanating from the Maghreb and Sahel regions, both of which threaten American lives and interests, will continue and may even grow in the years to come. The tragic attack in Benghazi and other subsequent terrorism in North Africa is not a reason to retreat. An effective response will require more local and regional partners, more cooperation with allies, more resources, and most of all a willingness to accept risk.</p>

<p><strong>Kenneth Lieberthal on North Korea:</strong></p>
<p>“I think the bottom line is China has moved from giving clear priority to stability in North Korea, with denuclearization very much secondary, to a current position where they accord equal weight to denuclearization of North Korea and stability of North Korea. We of course want them to have denuclearization first and foremost. I don’t think they are there yet and I think it’s going to be hard to move them beyond their current position.”</p>
<p><strong>Kenneth Lieberthal on cybersecurity:</strong></p>
<p>“The U.S. in the cyber arena is trying to drawing a bright red line. Effectively, the U.S. position is everyone conducts espionage; we don’t object to Chinese espionage, they should not object to ours. But, the U.S. does not do commercial espionage to benefit our own firms competitive position, the Chinese side does and we insist that they stop.” </p>
<p><strong>Eswar Prasad on the People's Bank of China:</strong></p>
<p>"Across the Pacific, the People’s Bank of China’s actions during the recent liquidity squeeze in China’s financial system have received a lot of attention. My interpretation is that the PBOC hung tough even while markets seemed to be undergoing a fair degree of turmoil with interbank rates shooting up, but it signals there is very significant support among the top leadership for financial sector and banking reforms."</p>
<p><strong>Eswar Prasad on U.S.-China investment:</strong></p>
<p>"The U.S. will continue pushing for better access of U.S. corporations and financial institutions, China’s markets, and also for better intellectual property protection. China, for its part, will be eager to get more clarity from the U.S. government about Chinese firms access to investment opportunities in the U.S. as well as U.S. technology."</p><h4>

<p>According to Eiselein, BuzzFeed included the photo without his consent in a collection titled &ldquo;The 30 Funniest Header Faces&rdquo; published in June 2010. After he sent BuzzFeed a takedown notice in May 2011, the company removed the photo and renamed the collection &ldquo;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/the-30-funniest-header-faces">The 29 Funniest Header Faces</a>.&rdquo; By that time, however, Eiselein alleges that the set of images including his photo had spread virally from BuzzFeed to dozens of other websites. Eiselein asserts that BuzzFeed is liable for contributory infringement for the photo&rsquo;s use on those sites&mdash;and on sites that published it after he registered it with the U.S. Copyright Office in late June 2011. (Copyright registration allows a plaintiff to recover very high &ldquo;statutory&rdquo; damages for subsequent infringement.)</p>
<p>In discussing copyright issues in April 2012 with <em>The Atlantic</em>&rsquo;s Alexis Madrigal, BuzzFeed&rsquo;s founder and CEO Jonah Peretti <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/where-do-all-those-buzzfeed-cute-animal-pictures-come-from/256547/">said</a>, &ldquo;I would love if every image contained some secret metadata and a way to license that image . . . But the practical reality is that it is pretty challenging, particularly in the web culture of animals and the images that spread on Pinterest and Tumblr.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">And what happens when BuzzFeed uses an image that it hasn&rsquo;t licensed? That, suggested Peretti to <i>The Atlantic</i>, can fall under the &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; doctrine of U.S. copyright law: &ldquo;Is it good for the world to have a broad definition of Fair Use where people can create new things that are transformative or that people can enjoy?&rdquo; Peretti said. &ldquo;I think it is good for the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">Under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106">U.S. law</a>, it is generally unlawful to distribute (or reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, etc.) a copyrighted work without authorization from the copyright owner. However, there is a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">fair use</a> exception &ldquo;for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, . . . scholarship, or research.&rdquo; Courts examining whether a use is fair consider a set of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">four factors</a>:</p>
<ol>
    <li style="color: #3c3c3c;">the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes</li>
    <li style="color: #3c3c3c;">the nature of the copyrighted work</li>
    <li style="color: #3c3c3c;">the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole</li>
    <li style="color: #3c3c3c;">the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">A movie critic who includes a line of dialog in a movie review is generally engaging in fair use, as is a middle school teacher who hands out photocopies of a short, properly cited excerpt of a recent news article to students in his or her classroom.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">But not all scenarios are so straightforward. When assessing the &ldquo;purpose and character of the use&rdquo; for more complex scenarios, courts in recent decades have given significant weight to whether the use was &ldquo;transformative.&rdquo; As Pierre Leval, who was at that time a federal judge in New York, wrote in an influential 1990 <i>Harvard Law Review </i><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/1341457.pdf">article</a>, &ldquo;If the secondary use adds value to the original . . . this is the very type of activity that the fair use doctrine intends to protect for the enrichment of society.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">Can a parody of a copyrighted work, made for commercial purposes, qualify as fair use? Yes, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-1292.ZO.html">ruled</a> in 1994 in <i>Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.</i>, a case that considered rap group 2 Live Crew&rsquo;s parody of the 1960s rock ballad &ldquo;Oh, Pretty Woman.&rdquo; &ldquo;The more transformative the new work,&rdquo; wrote the Court, &ldquo;the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">What about a collage constructed using copyrighted content from others? Earlier this year, the Second Circuit considered this question in a lawsuit filed by photographer Patrick Cariou against artist Richard Prince. Prince&rsquo;s work, the court explained in its <a href="http://blogs.library.duke.edu/scholcomm/files/2013/04/138475739-Cariou-v-Prince-2nd-Circ.pdf">ruling</a> [PDF] in <i>Cariou v. Prince</i>, involves &ldquo;taking photographs and other images that others have produced and incorporating them into paintings and collages that he then presents, in a different context, as his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">Cario contended that 30 of Prince&rsquo;s paintings and collages incorporated his photographs in an infringing manner. The Second Circuit, however, viewed most of the works in dispute as transformative. Prince&rsquo;s images, wrote the court, &ldquo;have a different character, give Cariou&rsquo;s photographs a new expression, and employ new aesthetics with creative and communicative results distinct from Cariou&rsquo;s.&rdquo; For 25 of the 30 works at issue in the case, the court concluded that Prince&rsquo;s incorporation of Cariou&rsquo;s copyrighted photographs was fair use.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">So where does this leave BuzzFeed as it responds to Kai Eiselein&rsquo;s allegations? The company will probably argue that its inclusion of Eiselein&rsquo;s photograph within a larger thematic collection was transformative. But that is unlikely to carry the day. The Second Circuit&rsquo;s decision in <i>Cariou v. Prince</i>&mdash;which is a binding precedent in the New York federal court where Eiselein&rsquo;s suit was filed&mdash;recognized that not all uses are transformative uses: &ldquo;A derivative work that merely presents the same material but in a new form, such as a book of synopses of televisions shows, is not transformative.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s hard to credibly claim that selecting an image to include in a list constitutes a transformation.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">That doesn&rsquo;t mean Eiselein will prevail on all of his claims. BuzzFeed will likely argue that he has misapplied the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504">statutory damage law</a> by demanding a separate payment for each alleged post-June 2011 infringement, as opposed to a single payment for the one work involved. Eiselein will also face challenges showing that BuzzFeed is liable for contributory infringement. And, there could be extraterritoriality issues as well, since many of the sites listed in the complaint are overseas.&nbsp;Eiselein will need to tie the presence of his photo on those sites to infringing acts in the United States.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">In short, Eiselein is very unlikely to get a multimillion-dollar payment from BuzzFeed. But he is also unlikely to walk away completely empty-handed. After all, as a content creator he should be able to display his work in the 21st century equivalent of a town square while also retaining the associated intellectual property rights. Put another way, uploading user-generated content to the Internet shouldn&rsquo;t require granting what amounts to a compulsory royalty-free license for anyone else who might want to use it.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">Of course, it&rsquo;s best to avoid a fight over fair use in the first place. Companies like BuzzFeed would be better served by steering clear of images that aren&rsquo;t either in the public domain or easily licensable. And content creators can use mechanisms other than litigation to push social media sites to be more attuned to copyright issues.</p>

To help understand where the United States and Russia are on nuclear arms reductions, as well as possible next steps, Brookings Arms Control Initiative Director Steven Pifer has prepared a PowerPoint presentation that outlines the New START Treaty, possible next steps on strategic forces, non-strategic nuclear weapons and missile defense issues. This PowerPoint will be useful for anyone seeking a quick introduction to the intricate world of nuclear arms control.</p>

And while the onus of accountability ought not rest exclusively on Muslim Americans, it understandably weighs most heavily on them. Indeed, any fair-minded assessment of recent events must underscore the inadequacies of Muslim-American leaders. Yet the usual criticisms are wide of the mark and fail to identify the institutional as well as intellectual weaknesses of these leaders.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">In general we too easily overlook​&mdash;​even in the midst of a raging debate over our immigration policy​&mdash;​what Norman Podhoretz once referred to as &ldquo;the brutal bargain&rdquo; that immigrant children must accept in order to assimilate into the society their parents chose for them. For Muslims today, the drama involves not so much overcoming poverty and educational deficits but adapting to a society whose values are sharply at odds with their religious heritage. Among Muslim-American youth, especially since 9/11, this has led to heightened criticism and suspicion of U.S. government policies at home and abroad. More generally, it has resulted in a hard-edged identity politics that has encouraged some young Muslims to define themselves not only in opposition to the government but to American society and culture.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">Marcia Hermansen, a Muslim who is also a professor of Islamic studies at Loyola University in Chicago, recounts her shock when she &ldquo;encountered some Muslim students on my campus who seemed to feel vindicated by the destruction and loss of life on September 11.&rdquo; As she elaborates, &ldquo;Quite a number of Muslim youth in America are becoming rigidly conservative and condemnatory of their peers (Muslim and non-Muslim), their parents, and all who are not within a narrow ideological band of what I will define as internationalist, &lsquo;identity&rsquo; Islam.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">This trend was picked up by Pew pollsters who reported in 2007 that Muslims older than 30 were much less likely (28 percent) than those aged 18-29 (42 percent) to agree that &ldquo;there is a natural conflict between being a devout Muslim and living in a modern society.&rdquo; When it surveyed Muslims again in 2011, Pew asked if &ldquo;there is only one true way to interpret the teachings of Islam&rdquo;: 31 percent of foreign-born Muslims agreed, but 46 percent of native-born Muslims did. Also that year, Pew found that 58 percent of foreign-born Muslims agreed &ldquo;the American people are generally friendly toward Muslim Americans,&rdquo; compared with only 37 percent of their native-born offspring.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">Among many Muslim-American youth, there is self-conscious rejection of their parents&rsquo; easygoing, traditionalist understanding of Islam, inevitably suffused with the customs of their homeland. The youthful response is frequent invocations of the <em>ummah</em>, the worldwide community of Muslims that ideally transcends all barriers of ethnicity, race, and nationality. Sustained by such Islamist constructs, young Muslims on college campuses often trump their parents&rsquo; insistence that they marry within their ethnic group with a religiously grounded ethic that prioritizes marrying another Muslim regardless of ethnic or racial background.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">As Hermansen notes, such youthful perspectives entail a &ldquo;religious and cultural superiority &hellip; a mindless and rigid rejection of &lsquo;the Other&rsquo; &hellip; a smug pride in one&rsquo;s superior manifestation of visible symbols of identity.&rdquo; One result is a preoccupation with &ldquo;the evils of Western cultural elements such as the celebration of birthdays, Halloween, and prom night.&rdquo; And while this mindset does not typically lead to violence, it was clearly on display when Tamerlan Tsarnaev disrupted speakers at his Cambridge mosque when they embraced the celebration of American national holidays such as Thanksgiving and praised a non-Muslim religious leader, Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">Hermansen argues that such views have been &ldquo;allowed to run unchecked and uncriticized .&thinsp;&thinsp;.&thinsp;&thinsp;. even been encouraged among youth by mainstream Muslim organizations in America.&rdquo; In fact, Muslim-American leaders have themselves espoused such views, especially before 9/11. Yet since then, these leaders have been struggling, however opportunistically, to adapt to the realities of American life. The problem is that they have all too often led their followers down blind alleys.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">For example, in the 1970s and 1980s Muslim leaders explicitly urged their people to avoid assimilating into the American mainstream and to withdraw into Islamic community centers, schools, and colleges. Paradoxically, they also encouraged Muslims to do <em>dawa</em> and seek to convert the very Americans they were to shun. Similarly, these leaders denounced U.S. foreign policies impacting the <em>ummah</em> but discouraged Muslims here from participating in the political process.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">Since 9/11, Muslim leaders have shown a remarkable​&mdash;​and largely unnoted, or disbelieved​&mdash;​willingness to adapt to America. Indeed, these leaders have been busily reconstructing an anodyne version of Islam that conforms to the American civil religion. Yet once again, they are leading the faithful into various double-binds.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">So today Muslim Americans are being reassured that it is permissible​&mdash;​even desirable​&mdash;​to have non-Muslim friends. And that it is okay to attend business lunches where non-Muslim colleagues drink alcohol. And that it is definitely a good idea to vote and get involved in civic and political affairs.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">Other topics are addressed with discretion. Explicit displays of Islamic triumphalism are now rare. The topic of intermarriage with non-Muslims is typically avoided. Controversial political issues get finessed. Since 9/11, Muslim Americans have learned to be much more discreet about their views on Palestine and U.S. support for Israel. Much of the energy concerning such issues has been rechanneled into opposition to the wars in Afghanistan and especially in Iraq or to the Obama administration&rsquo;s reliance on drones.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">Similarly, Muslim Americans feel free to indulge their vehement opposition to profiling at airports and to the Patriot Act. As for domestic policy, Muslims can be heard voicing support for efforts addressing racial and gender discrimination and for comprehensive immigration reform. More generally, they support social welfare programs, including Obamacare.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">If all of this sounds familiar, it should. This is the Democratic agenda, which over the past decade Muslim-American leaders have visibly embraced. But this has meant their virtual silence on an array of social and cultural issues on which Muslim opinion continues to diverge from that of their newfound allies. Unlike before 9/11, when Muslims were lining up with Republicans, their leaders are no longer outspoken about alcohol abuse, drugs, gambling, pornography, and abortion.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">Gay rights is the one cultural issue on which Muslim-American leaders have taken a U-turn, and it sustains my point that they are not well positioned to speak forthrightly and authoritatively to their own people, especially to questioning youth. Twenty years ago, these leaders condemned homosexual rights as an aspect of American society that justified withdrawal from the mainstream. Today, Muslim leaders are hardly barnstorming for gay rights, but they have ceased condemning homosexuals and homosexuality and have embraced tolerance.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">A prime example of this shift is William Suhaib Webb, imam of the controversial Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center. A few years ago Webb emphasized Islam&rsquo;s condemnation of homosexuality to an audience of young Muslims. With regard to gay marriage, he asked: &ldquo;Why are we so quiet? We have something to offer society, and we should ask America nicely what has happened to your values in 40 years?&rdquo; Yet in a <em>Boston Globe</em> interview last month, Webb said that with regard to gay marriage he had made &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; and was reluctant &ldquo;to start arguing about other people&rsquo;s liberties,&rdquo; claiming that the Constitution guarantees the right of everyone to get married.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">Such bold revisionism has to alienate as many Muslims​&mdash;​including young people​&mdash;​as it gratifies. But such U-turns are undoubtedly easier for a handful of leaders, like Suhaib Webb, whose skillful use of the national media has permitted them to reach beyond the confines of a given mosque or local Muslim community. Indeed, in most such contexts it is seldom clear who the leaders really are. To be sure, this dilemma is endemic to Sunni Islam and can be traced to its decentralized, non-hierarchical structure. Yet in America, with Muslims from around the globe struggling to coexist in self-governing mosques, leadership is all the more problematic.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">In most mosques here, leadership is up for grabs. Contrary to what non-Muslims think, imams are not necessarily in charge. They are typically foreigners who understand Islam but lack specific knowledge about American culture, society, and politics. Their command of English may also be limited.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">The imam gets hired by the mosque governing board. In most countries mosques are subsidized by the state, but here they are self-supporting voluntary institutions. So the board&rsquo;s other major responsibility is the institution&rsquo;s financial viability, and it tends to be dominated by key donors, invariably affluent professionals​&mdash;​stereotypically, Pakistani doctors and engineers. The most assertive or most generous member is likely to be board president, who may easily overshadow the imam and become the de facto leader of the mosque.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">This dynamic can be a source of tension and conflict, which are invariably exacerbated by the diversity of the congregation. Because Shia and Sunni tend to worship separately, this sectarian divide does not typically trouble mosques here. But social class antagonisms do arise​&mdash;​for example, between successful doctors and struggling cab drivers. And disagreements emerge between more established Muslims who have invested time and resources in the mosque and recently arrived immigrants who take it all for granted and, in addition, have divergent understandings of Islam.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">The sharpest divides may arise from linguistic, ethnic, and racial differences. These could involve disagreements over the different <em>madhabs</em>, or schools of Islamic jurisprudence. And so, Arabs and South Asians tend to establish their own mosques. Nevertheless, most mosques have mixed congregations with a variety of languages and cultures from around the globe. Then there are racial divides, especially with regard to African-American Muslims. And quite apart from religion, Muslim immigrants bring with them from their home countries different political orientations and agendas.</p>
<p style="margin: auto 0in;" class="p3">In such contexts, leadership is not easy to exercise. Whoever is &ldquo;in charge&rdquo; is likely to be cautious and risk-averse. Of course, what looks cautious from inside may look outrageous from outside. Thus, one imam relates that it would be &ldquo;career suicide&rdquo; to denounce the violent Islamist Sayyid Qutb to his members​&mdash;​even as this same imam preaches tolerance to his congregation and beyond. Conversely, it is easy and useful for imams and other Muslim leaders to attack the war on terror, the Patriot Act, and other such policies on which there is nearly unanimous opposition.</p>

<p>Assessing the severity of economic problems often requires choosing between different sets of analyses that reach disparate conclusions. While much lip service is paid to &ldquo;evidence-based policymaking,&rdquo; all too often it works the other way in Washington, with problematic &ldquo;facts&rdquo; serving as the basis for &ldquo;policy-based evidence-making,&rdquo; in the phrase of my colleague Richard Reeves. Instead of trying to discern why different analyses yield different conclusions, and whether one is better supported than another, partisans simply pick the results that support their beliefs. Sometimes the evidence really is unclear, and resolving the question requires further research. But other times, it is clear enough, and those committed to evidence-based policymaking should favor some conclusions over others.</p>
<p>Consider the state of the middle class. According to <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/2011/H05_2011.xls">published Census Bureau figures</a>, median household income (adjusted for inflation) was just 5 percent higher in 2011 than in 1979. But thanks to economists such as Cornell University&rsquo;s <a href="http://ntj.tax.org/wwtax/ntjrec.nsf/009a9a91c225e83d852567ed006212d8/30212f14664082b1852579b5006904e1/$FILE/A01_Larrimore.pdf">Richard Burkhauser</a>, the University of Chicago&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.aei.org/files/2011/10/25/Material-Well-Being-Poor-Middle-Class.pdf">Bruce Meyer</a>, and Notre Dame&rsquo;s James Sullivan &mdash; all of whose work has recently been bolstered by <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43373">Congressional Budget Office</a> estimates &mdash; it has become irrefutably clear that, when properly measured, middle-class incomes actually rose by at least 30 percent between 1979 and 2007 (both business-cycle peaks), and possibly by 40 percent or more. The Census Bureau figures indicate only a 15 percent rise between these years.</p>
<p>Faced with the overwhelming evidence that household incomes have risen significantly, some observers have tried to rescue the theory of middle-class decline by pointing to evidence that earnings have fallen sharply among working-age men. Thus, the story goes, rising household income simply reflects the fact that women have gone to work in response to the deterioration of their husbands&rsquo; standing.</p>
<p>There are a number of problems with this claim, the main one being that, across the developed world, rising employment among women has coincided with their rising educational attainment, as well as deferred marriage, delayed childbearing, and lower fertility. This suggests that women today work more than their 1950s counterparts for reasons unrelated to men&rsquo;s earnings. Less appreciated is that middle-class men are doing better than the most widely cited statistics indicate.</p>
<p>Commentators often cite estimates from <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/7/men%20earnings%20greenstone%20looney/07_milken_greenstone_looney.pdf">Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney</a>, my colleagues at the Brookings Institution&rsquo;s Hamilton Project. Greenstone and Looney, whose work I generally admire, argue that the rise in labor-force dropout among working-age men masks frightful trends. People who spend the entire year jobless are not usually included in earnings statistics, but if these men, most of whom are less skilled, did work, they would be factored into the Census Bureau&rsquo;s Current Population Survey (CPS). The result would be not the stagnation in male earnings seen in Census Bureau figures, but sharp decline. Taking this into account, the Hamilton Project reports that median earnings among men ages 25 to 64 declined by an astonishing 28 percent from 1969 to 2009.</p>
<p>To be sure, measures of earnings trends ought to account for labor-force dropout. But the conclusion that men&rsquo;s earnings have plummeted stems from inappropriate methodological decisions and inadequate contextualization. Two such decisions were especially consequential. The first was to rely on a cost-of-living adjustment that results in an understatement of real-earnings growth. The Census Bureau has used an inflation adjustment known as the CPI-U-RS since 2001, but the Hamilton Project analyses use the CPI-U. Though widely employed in policymaking to update benefits and tax brackets for cost-of-living increases, the CPI-U is known to overstate inflation. (This problem lies behind the push in Washington to switch to the chained CPI, yet another measure, in updating Social Security benefits and tax brackets. Doing so would cause benefits and tax brackets to rise more slowly over time, reducing government spending and increasing revenue.) For analyzing income trends, the CPI-U was abandoned over 20 years ago by not only the Census Bureau, but also the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Congressional Budget Office.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Using the CPI-U-RS yields a 1 percent decline between 1969 and 2011 in median earnings among men ages 25 to 64, whereas using the CPI-U results in a 12 percent decline.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>In addition, the Hamilton Project counts <i>all</i> non-working men between 25 and 64 as below-median earners. This is a large group; according to the CPS, the share of men between 25 and 64 who went an entire year without working rose from 5 percent in 1969 to 18 percent in 2011. The share who reported being unable to find work rose from essentially zero to 3 percent, while the share who did no work and reported being sick or disabled rose from 3 percent to 8 percent.</p>
<p>This rise in reported sickness and disability mirrors an increase over the years in receipt of federal disability benefits &mdash; an increase that has not been accompanied by any deterioration in the health of workers. As Burkhauser and MIT economist David Autor have shown, this increase has basically constituted a rise in welfare receipt among men who would have worked in the past. The Hamilton Project is right that conventional figures should be corrected to account for these disappearing men, who, it may be assumed, are overwhelmingly lower-skilled and would therefore bring median earnings down if they worked. More to the point, to the extent these men have become more numerous, their inclusion in the data would cause the <i>trend</i> in median earnings to look worse than published Census Bureau figures convey.</p>
<p>Counting all non-working men as below-median earners &mdash; and using the CPI-U &mdash; yields the widely cited estimate that median male earnings declined by 28 percent from 1969 to 2009. Using the same method, I find a decline of 26 percent. The small difference likely reflects the fact that the Hamilton Project figures include institutionalized men, who are not interviewed in the CPS. Extending the trend beyond 2009, my figures show a decline of 28 percent from 1969 to 2011.</p>
<img width="565" height="413" alt="" src="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Articles/2013/07/01 mens rising earnings winship/01 mens rising earnings figure 1.JPG" />
<p>But the Hamilton Project&rsquo;s assumption is far too sweeping. Among the non-working men it adds in, who are assumed to be below-median earners, are retirees and a smaller group including students, stay-at-home dads, armed-forces members who live in barracks, and men living in mental institutions or residential-care facilities. The retirees, in particular, were a growing group over the period in question, as the typical age at retirement moved steadily downward. It makes no sense to assume that all or even a majority of retirees or students would have earnings below the median if they were in the work force. The remaining groups should be thought of as mostly outside the population of interest in these analyses. In short, the Hamilton Project had a valuable insight about invisible men, but instead of throwing in <i>all</i> non-workers as below-median earners, it should have included only a subset.</p>
<p>If we accept the Hamilton Project&rsquo;s correction but follow the Census Bureau&rsquo;s practice of using the CPI-U-RS, the 28 percent decline through 2011 shrinks to 19 percent. If we then include as below-median earners only those non-working men who report being sick or disabled and those who report not being able to find work, median earnings fall just 12 percent. Finally, if we compare the peak year of 1969 with 2007, another peak year, rather than with 2011, a year in which the economy was recovering from the worst downturn since the Great Depression, there is no decline at all.</p>
<img width="566" height="413" alt="" src="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Articles/2013/07/01 mens rising earnings winship/01 mens rising earnings figure 2.JPG" />
<p>The picture gets brighter as the estimates are further refined. (I will keep focusing on men ages 25 to 64, including non-working men if they were sick or disabled or could not find work.) One change that has affected earnings statistics in recent decades is rising immigration. As the number of immigrants has increased, so too has the share of the work force with limited formal education. These workers are undoubtedly better off than they would be in their home countries, but if we add more and more below-median earners to the economy, we necessarily end up with a lower median.</p>
<p>It is impossible to identify immigrants in the CPS before 1993, but we can identify Hispanics as early as 1970. Other Census Bureau data indicate that the foreign-born rose from 5 percent of the population in 1970 to 13 percent by 2007. If we exclude Hispanics, however, the increase is only from about 4 percent to 7 percent.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> This is surely an imperfect adjustment for rising immigration, but it gives a decent picture of what an ideal adjustment would show.</p>
<p>Assuming the 1969-to-1970 earnings change was the same as that for men in general, median earnings among non-Hispanic men declined from 1969 to 2011 not by 12 percent but by 8 percent. From 1969 to 2007, they rose by 2 percent. Among Hispanic men, earnings fell by 24 percent through 2011, but this decline is simply a more dramatic demonstration of how rising immigration pulls the median downward. Among non-Hispanics, the earnings increase for blacks was stronger than for whites, so this is not simply a story about non-Hispanic whites&rsquo; doing better than everyone else.</p>
<img width="565" height="413" alt="" src="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Articles/2013/07/01 mens rising earnings winship/01 mens rising earnings figure 3.JPG" />
<p>To this point, the analyses have assumed that the CPI-U-RS is an appropriate cost-of-living adjustment, but this index, too, overstates inflation. When particular goods and services become cheaper, consumers buy more of them and less of others. The CPI-U-RS only partly reflects such choices: It accounts for consumers&rsquo; ability to switch brands of coffee, for example, but does not recognize that consumers can switch from coffee to tea.</p>
<p>The chained CPI does a better job, but it goes back only to 2000. Another cost-of-living index, the PCE (personal consumption expenditure) deflator, accounts for this &ldquo;substitution bias&rdquo; and is available going back decades. The Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve Board both prefer the PCE to other indices.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> If we switch from the CPI-U-RS to the PCE, median earnings among non-Hispanic men fell by 1 percent from 1969 to 2011, instead of by 8 percent. From 1969 to 2007, they rose by 10 percent.</p>
<p>Finally, earnings are narrowly defined to include wages, salaries, and self-employment income. But for workers employed by firms, what ultimately matters is total compensation, including fringe benefits. My final analyses make two modifications. They drop men with self-employment income (which has essentially no effect on the results), since the self-employed do not receive employer-paid benefits. Then they incorporate an adjustment for non-wage benefits using Bureau of Economic Analysis figures. These benefits include employer contributions for pensions, group health and life insurance, and payroll taxes. They were 10 percent of compensation in 1969 but 20 percent in 2011.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The adjustments yield the result that men&rsquo;s compensation rose by 14 percent between 1969 and 2011. From 1969 to 2007, a peak year, the increase was 20 percent. These estimates reflect the change in what employers pay to the typical worker, though they may overstate the typical worker&rsquo;s improvement in living standards. It may be that employees would rather receive cash than pensions or health insurance, in which case the increase in the enjoyment or satisfaction the median male receives from his compensation would be somewhat less than 20 percent. It would be strange, though, for employers not to recognize this preference.</p>
<img width="568" height="413" alt="" src="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Articles/2013/07/01 mens rising earnings winship/01 mens rising earnings figure 4.JPG" />
<p>Perhaps the favorable tax treatment associated with those benefits distorts employer decisions and prevents workers from attaining even higher living standards. It&rsquo;s also possible that workers would rather receive cash than have their employers contribute toward their Social Security and Medicare benefits, in which case federal social-insurance programs also keep living standards lower than they would otherwise be. That, too, seems unlikely, given the political difficulty proposals to reform senior entitlements have faced. Some analysts may find my treatment of employee benefits inadequate and prefer the earnings estimates to the compensation ones. In that case, the increase, peak to peak, was 10 percent instead of 20 percent. That is still a more accurate conclusion than the claim that male earnings have plummeted, and a very different one. Careful empirical analysis does not always end debate, but in this case and others it should at least narrow its scope.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> For the well-known shortcomings of the CPI-U, see <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/112xx/doc11256/cpi_brief.pdf">http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/112xx/doc11256/cpi_brief.pdf</a>. Twenty-three years ago, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a statement recommending the use of a new index it developed, the &ldquo;CPI-U-X1,&rdquo; instead of the CPI-U. The Census Bureau stopped using the CPI-U and switched to the CPI-U-X1 in 1992, and it began using the CPI-U-RS in 2001. CBO abandoned the CPI-U for the CPI-U-X1 for income analyses as early as 1988, switched to the CPI-U-RS, and now relies on a different index, discussed below. The widely-cited inequality estimates of Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez showing the share of income gains going to the top one percent also use the CPI-U-RS.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> All of my income estimates, for all of the years between 1969 and 2011, are available at <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/articles/2013/07/01-mens-rising-earnings-winship/full-earnings-results-1969-to-2011.xlsx">http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/articles/2013/07/01-mens-rising-earnings-winship/full-earnings-results-1969-to-2011.xlsx</a>. The estimates are based on Current Population Survey data (the Annual Social and Economic Supplement, or &ldquo;March Supplement&rdquo;), which I downloaded from the Unicon Research Corporation website (<a href="http://www.unicon.com/">www.unicon.com</a>). These data files were analyzed in STATA, and the statistical code is available at <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/articles/2013/07/01-mens-rising-earnings-winship/final-median-earnings-trends.do">http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/articles/2013/07/01-mens-rising-earnings-winship/final-median-earnings-trends.do</a>. </p>

For the 1970 estimate excluding Hispanics, I multiplied the 4.7 percent from the Census Bureau spreadsheet by .806, which is 100% minus the 19.4% estimate of the foreign born that is from Latin America in Figure 1 of Grieco (2010).&nbsp; That the &ldquo;Latin America&rdquo; estimate is a good proxy for &ldquo;Hispanic&rdquo; is confirmed by comparing the 2007 &ldquo;Latin America&rdquo; share of the foreign born in Figure 1 (53.6%) to the &ldquo;Hispanic&rdquo; share of the foreign born in Figure 2 (47.5%). For the 2007 estimate excluding Hispanics, I multiplied the 12.6% foreign born estimate on page 3 of Grieco (2010) by .525, which is the share of the foreign-born population that is not Hispanic in Figure 2.</p>

	<p>The recent gyrations in the Chinese interbank market underscore that the chief risk to global growth now comes from China. Make no mistake: credit policy will tighten substantially in the coming months, as the government tries to push loan growth from its current rate of 20% down to something much closer to the rate of nominal GDP growth, which is about half that. Moreover, in the last few months of the year the new government will likely start concrete action on some long-deferred structural reforms. These reforms will bolster China&rsquo;s medium-term growth prospects, but the short-term impact will be tough for the economy and for markets.</p>
<p>The combination of tighter credit and structural reforms means that with the best of luck China could post GDP growth in 2014 of a bit over 6%, its weakest showing in 15 years and well below most current forecasts. A policy mistake such as excessive monetary tightening could easily push growth below the 6% mark. Banks and corporations appear finally to be getting the message that the new government, unlike its predecessor, will not support growth at some arbitrary level through investment stimulus.</p>
<p>The dire performance of China&rsquo;s stock markets in the past two weeks reflects this growing realization among domestic investors, although we suspect stocks have further to fall before weaker growth is fully discounted.</p>
<h2>Slower growth&hellip; but no Armageddon</h2>
<p>But the China risk is mainly of a negative growth shock, not financial Armageddon as some gloomier commentary suggests. Financial crisis risk remains relatively low because the system is closed and the usual triggers are unavailable. Emerging market financial crises usually erupt for one of two reasons: a sudden departure of foreign creditors or a drying-up of domestic funding sources for banks. China has little net exposure to foreign creditors and runs a large current account surplus, so there is no foreign trigger. And until now, banks have funded themselves mainly from deposits at a loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) of under 70%, although the increased use of quasi-deposit wealth management products means the true LDR may be a bit higher, especially for smaller banks. The danger arises when banks push up their LDRs and increasingly fund themselves from the wholesale market. So a domestic funding trigger does not exist&mdash;yet.</p>
<p>The People&rsquo;s Bank of China clearly understands the systemic risk of letting banks run up lending based on fickle wholesale funding. This is why it put its foot down last week and initially refused to pump money into the straitened interbank market. Interbank and repo rates have dropped back from their elevated levels, but remain significantly above the historical average. The message to banks is clear: lend within your means. This stance raises confidence that Beijing will not let the credit bubble get out of control. But it also raises the odds that both credit and economic growth will slow sharply in the coming 6-12 months.</p>
<p>If the economy slows and local stock markets continue to tumble, doesn&rsquo;t this mean the renminbi will also weaken sharply? Not necessarily. Beijing has a long-term policy interest in increasing the international use of the renminbi, which can only occur if the currency earns a reputation as a reliable store of value in good times and bad. Allowing a sharp devaluation now runs against this interest, and also would be a sharp break from a long-established policy of not resorting to devaluation to stimulate growth, even at moments of severe stress (as in 1997-98 and 2008-09). So while our call on China growth has been marked down, our call on the renminbi has not.</p>
<h2>Short-term pain is better than long-term stagnation</h2>
<p>From a broader perspective, the biggest China risk is not that the country suffers a year or two of sharply below-trend growth. If that slowdown reflects more rational credit allocation and the early, painful stages of productivity-enhancing reforms, it will be healthy medicine. And even a much slower China will still be growing faster than all developed markets and most emerging ones.</p>
<p>The real risk is rather that the new government will show a lack of nerve or muscle and fail to push through financial sector liberalization, deregulation of markets to favor private firms, and fiscal reforms to curtail local governments&rsquo; ability to prop up failing firms, overspend on infrastructure, and inflate property bubbles. The old government wasted the last three years of its term doing none of these things despite the obvious need. The new leaders are talking a better game, but they have a year at most to articulate a clear reform program, begin implementation (liberalizing interest rates and freeing electricity prices would be a good start), and ruthlessly removing senior officials who stand in the way. If they fail to deliver, then the short-term slowdown could become a long and dismal decline.</p><div>

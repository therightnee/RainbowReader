Commissioner Barnier presented his views on how best to accelerate progress towards genuine financial stability. Brookings Fellow Douglas Elliott hosted the discussion and moderated a question and answer period.</p>
<p>Barnier began his remarks by describing how the European Union and the United States came to an agreement about how to regulate cross-border swaps at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, three and a half years ago. This &ldquo;ambitious global regulatory reform of the swaps markets&rdquo; set out to do three strategic tasks:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Clearing:</strong> To reduce risk in our financial firms and system by clearing all standardized swaps through central counterparties.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> To shed light on this opaque market and report all trades to trade repositories. We need to know where risk is building up in the system.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Trading:</strong> Where appropriate, to move standardized swaps to venues to increase market transparency</li>
</ol>
<p>Barnier compared uncoordinated cross-border regulations between the United States and the European Union to &ldquo;squeezing a bar of soap with wet hands: it slips from your hands. Trades will be re-booked. Markets will fragment. The G20 reform objectives will not be met.&rdquo; Barnier noted that 70% of all global economic transactions take place between the United States and the European Union nations. For this reason, he argued that the United States and European Union need to &ldquo;lead by example&rdquo; by carrying out necessary economic reforms to meet G20 commitments &ldquo;rigorously and sensibly.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Barnier described the trade negotiations between the European Union and the United States that began last week as focused on &ldquo;growth and leadership,&rdquo; which are imperative to cultivating new jobs in each sovereign nation, as well as finding solutions to trade predicaments that cannot be found through multilateral discussions. Barnier argued that the &ldquo;barriers to EU-US trade and investment are in the details of regulatory policy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;regulatory barriers can block trade outright. Make it too expensive to be viable. Fragment global markets. Or just act as a drag on overall economic efficiency.&rdquo; Mitigating these barriers through regulatory reform will effectively protect the European Union and the U.S. economies from risks to their citizens and financial security.</p>
<p>To conclude his remarks, Barnier noted that the fundamental component of transatlantic trade reform is the joint leadership between the United States and the European Union. He believes &ldquo;our financial sectors know no borders. They are intertwined and interdependent.&rdquo; By reflecting on the agreement on swaps, Commissioner Barnier believes that the United States and European Union can create a dynamic bond that will &ldquo;raise the bar in tomorrow&rsquo;s world of financial regulation.&rdquo;</p><h4>

<p><i>Vital Statistics</i>&rsquo; purpose has always been to collect useful data on our first branch of government &ndash; in the election and composition of its membership as well as its formal procedure, such as the use of the filibuster, informal norms, party structure and staff. This dataset also documents the increasing polarization of Congress and the demographics of those who serve in the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Over the years, we&rsquo;ve received innumerable requests for updated versions of the chapters in between printings of the published book. We heard you and have now changed the way we present <em>Vital Statistics&rsquo;</em> data: We&rsquo;ve put the book online, making each chapter available online as a collection of spreadsheets for download at no cost. This new interactive format allows us to update and correct the data more frequently and make it accessible to anyone interested in learning about Congress. We&rsquo;ve formatted the tables so that each is both printer-friendly and read-writable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage you to share your feedback and how you&rsquo;ve used this data set; and we plan on posting your most interesting findings.&nbsp;<a href="http://connect.brookings.edu/vitalstats" target="_blank">Find out how you can submit your own Vital Stats analyses &raquo;</a> </p>

<p><strong>Malala Yousafzai's Address at the United Nations Youth Assembly, July 12, 2013:</strong></p>

</p>
<p>Malala turning 16 parallels many cultural celebrations for girls&rsquo; coming of age, like the Quincea&ntilde;era in the Latin American tradition or the Bat Mitzvah in Judaism. &nbsp;Yet, even before these important rites of passage, many girls&rsquo; struggle to be educated or have already been deprived of that chance. Some work for years to help support their family or are forced into early marriages. &nbsp;One in seven girls from developing countries is married before her 15th birthday. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have attracted international attention to these issues and have improved conditions for girls, but we need an enduring commitment. &nbsp;On July 1, at the High-Level Segment at the U.N. Economic and Social Council meeting, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=6942">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon urged for greater progress</a> on the MDGs, particularly referencing the achievement of universal primary education and equitable opportunities for women. &nbsp;In 2011, sixty-five million girls were denied the chance to complete primary school and lower secondary school, and Malala Day reinforces the fact that progress is still needed.<br />
<br />
Girls are rallying together because their education has changed the fate of their futures. For every additional year of school a girl completes, her future earnings can increase by <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099079934475/547667-1135281504040/Returns_Investment_Edu.pdf">10 to 20 percent</a>. &nbsp;When girls are educated, they increase the potential to contribute to the economic vitality of their family and empower the next generation of girls to strive for the same opportunities. &nbsp;Some estimates even show that a 1 percent increase in the national level of women&rsquo;s education can foster a 0.3 percent increase in economic growth. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
But the movement for girls&rsquo; education is not just a &ldquo;girl thing.&rdquo; &nbsp;Boys see their mothers and sisters not receiving the same opportunities and know that they can play a role in promoting change too. &nbsp;For example, through a program called Brothers Join Meena, there are now 40,000 boy scouts in Baluchistan, Pakistan who have rallied together with UNICEF to help improve gender issues by consulting with local communities about the need to educate girls. &nbsp;This program has prompted an increase in female literacy rates there as well as an increase in immunization rates and a reduction of diseases spread by poor hygiene. &nbsp;Similarly, <a href="http://www.promundo.org.br/en/">Promundo</a>, based in Brazil, focuses on working with men and boys to transform gender norms and create dialogues on masculine identity. &nbsp;Their work engages the male community and shows how men can contribute to the conversation on gender equity. &nbsp;Increasingly through such initiatives, policymakers recognize the importance of including boys as well as girls in addressing gender issues.<br />
<br />
Third, youth are the future and are taking initiative to promote their educational success. &nbsp;On July 12, the Global Education First Youth Advocacy Group (YAG) will convene 500 young people for a &ldquo;youth takeover&rdquo; of the U.N. &nbsp;This group has come together to provide leadership and expertise on education issues through their own experiences as advocates in their respective country contexts. &nbsp;To mobilize people internationally, the YAG helped to develop a call to action around education entitled, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.worldwewant2015.org/node/352851">The Youth Resolution: The Education We Want</a>.&rdquo; &nbsp;Commitments to the document came in from almost 40 countries, and the YAG intend to share it with world leaders on Malala Day. &nbsp;With the MDGs set to expire in less than 1,000 days, the YAG seeks to ensure that youth rights and leadership are incorporated into the post-2015 international development framework. &nbsp;The expanse of this youth movement is not just a U.N. phenomenon, but something in which youths themselves can inspire and spark global change. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
While still considering the progress that has been made, Malala&rsquo;s emergence on the global stage does not signify a victory. &nbsp;Girls still remain the target of oppression, disadvantage and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22999663">violence</a> as they struggle to break gender barriers. &nbsp;Malala&rsquo;s story brings this issue to the forefront of the international development agenda and captivates our attention. &nbsp;With a mobilized youth population and leaders watching at the U.N., let&rsquo;s not forget the road ahead. &nbsp;Through this harnessed collective action, we must recognize youth&rsquo;s increased power to promote change and, in turn, amplify their voices.&nbsp;</p><div>

	<img src="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/images/n/na%20ne/nato_soldiers001/nato_soldiers001_16x9.jpg?w=120" alt="NATO soldiers stand with U.S. flag as a Chinook helicopter takes off after a security handover ceremony at a military academy outside Kabul June 18, 2013" border="0" /><br /><p>The Obama administration is reportedly considering an accelerated pullout of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, followed by a "zero option" - the complete elimination of an American and, presumably, international military presence in Afghanistan after 2014. This is an understandable but unwise idea. Even raising it as a bargaining device is a mistake in our ongoing mission in Afghanistan - a place that President Obama clearly considers crucial to U.S. security, given that more than 60,000 U.S. troops are still there.</p>
<p>In fairness, the zero-option idea has appeal not only because the war has been long and frustrating but also because Afghan President Hamid Karzai has been so difficult to work with. Beyond all the past brouhahas over corruption, tainted elections and other matters, there is the burst of invective Karzai recently leveled against the United States over what he described as a duplicitous approach to negotiating with the Taliban. Karzai has criticized Washington and broken off negotiations about the long-term U.S. presence because, when the Taliban opened an office for exploratory peace talks in Doha, Qatar, last month, it again called itself the Government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and otherwise sought to portray the new facility as a quasi-embassy for a government in waiting. Karzai decided that Washington was complicit because the Obama administration failed to prevent that outcome.</p>
<p>Karzai worries that U.S. officials will secretly cut a deal with the Taliban at his expense to hasten the U.S. troop departure from Afghanistan. Karzai has also accused the United States of instigating radical extremism on his territory, and he suspects that our real desire in having bases in Afghanistan after next year is quasi-imperialist, with an eye toward broader regional purposes beyond the immediate needs of Afghanistan and counterterrorism.</p>
<p>These actions and this attitude toward Washington are indeed regrettable. But they are no reason for the United States to threaten to pull the plug on all it has invested in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Karzai's recent outbursts, although excessive, are partly understandable. He had warned the Obama administration in private and public that the Taliban would seek to use its new political office in Doha as a virtual embassy. Washington not only failed to prevent that development but also seemed caught off-guard when it happened.</p>
<p>The bigger point, however, is this: Karzai is not Afghanistan, nor does he represent all Afghans. He won two presidential elections - and the United States should do a better job of acknowledging that he earned a mandate from his own people, despite election irregularities. But Karzai's frustrations with the war and the international community, and his frequent lashing-out, should not be conflated with any desire by most Afghans for U.S. troops to leave. Virtually all other Afghan political leaders I know very much want the international community to stay and remember all too well what happened a quarter-century ago, when the United States abruptly terminated its role in their country.</p>
<p>Leaving too soon, and withdrawing all U.S. and international forces, would greatly increase the risk of mission failure for the international community.</p>
<p>An accelerated departure and a zero option are inconsistent with the fact that Afghan security forces, although much improved, still need support and guidance and will continue to need them even after the NATO mission ends next year. This aid includes air support, technical aspects of intelligence, bomb-clearing technology and embedded mentors for commanders in the field.</p>
<p>Afghan security forces are holding their own on the battlefield and are in the lead nationwide. U.S. force numbers are down by one-third from their peak in 2011, and our rate of casualties has declined by an even higher percentage since then. Afghan army and police casualties are way up, indicating a commitment to the fight that we should admire and want to support. Yet the Afghan forces aren't strong enough to win or even guarantee continued containment of the Taliban on their own.</p>
<p>Beyond the military effects, if the international community totally withdrew, Afghan reformers and all those interested in building a new Afghanistan would suffer a huge psychological blow. Echoes of 1989 would be unmistakable. The ensuing crisis of confidence could be fatal. Indeed, it could affect next year's presidential elections, as many politicians and citizens could respond by seeking protection within their own ethnic communities, when what is needed is national unity.</p>
<p>U.S. officials may perceive the zero option as a smart negotiating tactic, but it actually reinforces the hedging behavior, especially in Pakistan, that allows the Taliban to maintain sanctuaries there. Pakistan's intelligence services and military see the Taliban as their backup plan, should Afghanistan revert to civil war, or chaos, after a premature NATO pullout. Some in Pakistan challenge this approach, but most Pakistanis will see little reason to question their long-standing strategy as long as we keep talking about a zero option.</p>
<p>The United States would be much better served by declaring its desire to help Afghanistan, provided that Afghans do their part and have a serious election next year and that Karzai then step down as required by his country's constitution (and as he has pledged to do). We need to help the Afghans with that process and avoid being bogged down in public squabbles that serve no constructive purpose.</p><div>

<p>The answer is that the reports,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/ib366-rhode-islands-hybrid-pension-plan/" target="_blank">one by Demos&rsquo;s Robert Hiltonsmith</a> and <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/bp363-brief-history-of-cuts-to-the-employees-retirement-system-of-rhode-island/" target="_blank">the other by EPI&rsquo;s Monique Morrissey</a>, offer some useful background information on pension reform in Rhode Island, but fail to provide sufficient evidence to support this striking conclusion.&nbsp; A careful analysis of the effects of a particular pension reform on benefits provided to public employees and costs incurred by taxpayers would entail detailed calculations under a range of possible assumptions. The level of benefits and their costs to taxpayers depend on many factors, including when employees retire, how long they worked, how long they live after retirement, and the investment returns on pension funds.</p>
<p>On the benefits side, a serious analysis would estimate the pension wealth of employees, based on how long they work for the state, before and after the policy change. Hiltonsmith misses the mark by simply providing estimates of yearly retirement income for an employee who spends her entire 30-year career working for the state of Rhode Island. This is the headline finding, but Hiltonsmith acknowledges that 30-year veterans are far from typical, noting that they receive annual pension benefits more than twice as large as the average state employee. Likewise, Morrissey&rsquo;s report indicates that &ldquo;the hybrid plan may provide more valuable benefits to some workers, including some mid-career job leavers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A comprehensive analysis would also address the tradeoffs between benefit cuts to full-career workers and benefit increases to employees who split their careers between different jobs.&nbsp; Hiltonsmith and Morrissey give us no basis for making such comparisons, choosing instead to highlight the cuts while barely mentioning the potential gains. This is important because there is&nbsp;<a href="http://web.missouri.edu/~podgurskym/articles/files/EDFP_a_00015.pdf" target="_blank">significant research</a> indicating that many traditional defined-benefit pension systems redistribute large amounts of pension wealth away from mobile employees who split their careers between the public and private sectors (or the same sector across multiple states) in order to finance more generous benefits for those who spend their entire career in the same sector in the same state.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the accumulation of pension wealth over an employee&rsquo;s career in Missouri under the existing defined-benefit (DB) plan and under a hypothetical reform called cash balance, which rewards employees with roughly the same retirement benefit for each year of service rather than in fits and starts.&nbsp; It would be misleading to trumpet the benefit cut to the long-serving group as a travesty while ignoring the fact that it would enable the state government to increase the benefits to those who serve the public for &ldquo;only&rdquo; 20 years.&nbsp; It is not enough to simply calculate the cuts to the benefits of those who benefited most from the old plan&mdash;they must be placed in the context of those who gain as a result.</p>

<p>On the cost side, what is needed is a careful side-by-side comparison of estimated costs under the new and old plans under various plausible assumptions. Hiltonsmith&rsquo;s headline finding that Rhode Island&rsquo;s new plan will cost the state more is based only on a cursory citation of the state&rsquo;s actuarial calculations. As my colleagues and I discuss in <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2013/06/12-public-pensions-johnson-chingos-whitehurst" target="_blank">a recent Brown Center report</a>, states seriously underestimate the underfunding of their defined-benefit pension systems due to overly optimistic assumptions about the rate of return they will earn on their pension funds.&nbsp; Rhode Island reduced its assumed return to 7.5 percent in 2010, which is more conservative than other states, but still likely to understate the costs of the traditional pension system given that promised benefits must be paid regardless of economic performance.</p>
<p>The question of how much Rhode Island&rsquo;s pension reforms saved taxpayers by moving to a hybrid system (and putting in place other policy changes) is an important one.&nbsp; Analyzing a reform that includes a defined contribution component (where benefits depend on market returns) involves an added complication in that it shifts risk from the government to the employee. Such a move exposes the government to less risk, and thus reduces the cost to taxpayers (using fair-value accounting practices that take into account the relative risk imposed on taxpayers by different policies). But it also decreases the value of the benefits received by risk-averse employees, which needs to be taken into account when evaluating the effect of the policy change on benefits.</p>
<p>Calculating the effects of reforms to pension systems is time-consuming and yawn-inducing, even for many of those who are fascinated by the topic.&nbsp; It is complicated by the faulty assumptions built into existing actuarial practices by state governments, but it is crucial work if states are to properly fund their pension systems and eliminate the perverse incentives that undermine the recruitment and retention of talented public servants. Rhode Island is among the few states that have enacted sweeping pension reforms. Accurate, comprehensive information about the effects of those changes is vital both locally and to other states deciding which changes to make to their own retirement systems.</p><div>

What began as a real estate bubble fueled by subprime mortgages in many states ballooned into a global financial panic of unprecedented magnitude.</p>
<p>Bundles of poorly underwritten mortgages generated toxic derivatives bets in a global market. When the dust settled, there was broad agreement that not only did we need a new financial regulatory regime, it had to be globally coordinated.</p>
<p>The United States, the European Union, Britain,&nbsp;Japan&nbsp;and other nations should come up with a regulatory regime that works across all borders. This does not have to be the exact same set of rules and regulations, but rather compatible systems, based on a common set of definitions and structures.</p>
<p>The need for international coordination in swaps is particularly important, for many of them involve parties in different countries. One common derivative, for example, an exchange-rate swap, allows parties in the United States to get payments in U.S. dollars while those in Europe are paid in euros. Any variation is the exchange rate between the two currencies&nbsp;is covered by the swap&mdash;for a fee.</p>
<p>We agree with European Union Commissioner Michel Barnier who said, "Where the rules of another country are comparable and consistent with the objectives of U.S. law, it is reasonable to expect U.S. authorities to rely on those rules and recognize activities regulated under them as compliant."</p>
<p>The devil is always in the details. Broad agreements for global coordination can quickly break down into national and international disputes over specific rules. Washington's main legislative response to the financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, recognized the global importance of regulation and required that U.S. regulation shall apply when derivatives have "a direct and significant connection with activities in, or effect on, commerce" of the United States.</p>
<p>Our capital&nbsp;markets&nbsp;regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission and&nbsp;Commodity&nbsp;Futures Trading Commission, are required to either set up their own regulations or accept a foreign system as compliant for all swaps that fit this definition.</p>
<p>Congress instructed the two panels to work together to devise these rules. Despite calls from many experts, however, Congress did not require the two commissions to come to agreement. A simple starting point would be for U.S. regulators to agree on basic constructs&mdash;such as the definition of who is a "U.S. person" or what constitutes "effect on commerce."</p>
<p>Nor did Congress take the more fundamental step of merging the SEC and the CFTC to create one overall capital&nbsp;markets&nbsp;regulator. Merging the two panels has strong bipartisan support&mdash;both Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, of the Bush administration, and former Representative Barney Frank (D-Mass.) proposed it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the SEC and CFTC cannot agree on basic concepts. So Washington lacks a unified voice in this global debate. Yet each regulator is moving forward on its own track. However, the CFTC, which has jurisdiction over roughly 95 percent of the market is stuck debating proposals which do not yet have majority support.</p>
<p>The CFTC has delayed implementation of these new rules through July 12, while they try to work out an implementation agreement. However, the agency's current draft proposal has encountered significant domestic and international pushback.</p>
<p>Recently, for example, the CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler and SEC Chairman Mary Jo White went to Montreal to negotiate with European Union officials to try to find common ground on when to apply U.S. rules and when to apply European rules.</p>
<p>There are reasons to find promise in the structure that the Europeans are contemplating. It is different from the CFTC's proposal, but may prove more efficient in establishing the best and strongest regulatory system.</p>
<p>The details are crucial to finding a solution, however. With the European regulatory structure not yet finalized, we must remain both vigilant and skeptical that the system will be as robust as some think it will.</p>
<p>However, the CFTC has indicated that it may not be willing to wait for the Europeans and others to finish their process and instead allow the U.S. to go forward alone. Unless action is taken, the CFTC's proposed rules will go into effect in mid-July. So the law will likely go into effect without the needed regulatory guidance explaining how to comply.</p>
<p>We support speedy adoption of the Dodd-Frank financial rules. In this case, however, international cooperation is so crucial that the CFTC ought to pass another extension, providing additional time for the Europeans and others to coordinate on a set of regulations.</p>
<p>If it has taken almost three years to get the rules right, we can certainly take another three months. What we should not do is allow this current extension to elapse and put into place a legal structure without any regulatory framework.</p>
<p>The CFTC should study the European regulations to make sure that our regulatory system can work with theirs. We should also incorporate the best elements of their system, acknowledging that other nations can often come up with excellent solutions. At no point, however, should we undermine our own regulatory system to make it compliant. We should work with Europe on a race to the top&mdash;not the bottom.</p>
<p>Good intentions do not always make for the best regulatory system. For example, a strong regulatory regime that is easily avoided by moving trading activities offshore provides little protection. The goal is to get it right - which in this case requires working with other nations.</p>
<p>While our internal regulatory system is unfortunately so bifurcated that it is difficult for Washington to speak with one voice, that should not stop us from working cooperatively to implement the best system worldwide.</p>
<p>Our solutions will be tested when the next crisis begins. Let's hope for everyone's sake that all nations get it right.</p><div>

<p>Chairmen Poe and Ros-Lehtinen, Ranking Members Sherman and Deutch, distinguished members of the subcommittees and staff, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am honored to be here to express my views. I am also humbled to be here on the panel with Michael Lovelady. Please know that my thoughts go out to him and the other relatives of those Americans who have died in Algeria and from other terrorist attacks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The terrorist attacks in Benghazi that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans have received exhaustive coverage, yet many of the long-term implications have not been fully considered. Future attacks, particularly those in North Africa, are likely to involve a Benghazi-style mix of jihadists of different nationalities, making it difficult to determine exactly who is responsible. Libya remains troubled, and the broader Maghreb and Sahel areas are unstable. Greater state weakness, not more stability, is likely in the years to come. So similar plots may be in our future.</p>
<p>I believe the U.S. reaction to the Benghazi attack, however, is likely to leave us less prepared for future terrorism. U.S. knowledge of Libya and the region has always been limited. Unfortunately, the political and bureaucratic lesson of Benghazi is clear &ndash; avoid risks at all costs. American diplomats and spies will be more confined to well-guarded parts of capital cities and more removed from local populations. This will keep them safer, but U.S. intelligence is likely to decline, and U.S. statecraft to diminish. In the long-run, diminishing U.S. capabilities could pose a grave danger to U.S. security, increasing the risk of a surprise attack or a regional development that catches the United States unawares. In addition, jihadists may point to any U.S. retreat after Benghazi as proof of U.S. cowardice.</p>
<p>The United States should bolster, not draw down, its presence in North Africa. America has important interests in the region and in any case the threats will not disappear simply because the U.S. chooses to ignore them. The region is now an important arena for jihadists, and the size of their area of operation is growing. In addition, jihadists from the region and weapons from Libya are showing up in places like Syria and Sinai. </p>
<p>We should seek to understand and engage regional governments and peoples to counter the threats that emanate from North Africa. To this end, Washington should maintain a robust and energetic intelligence and diplomatic presence, even in dangerous countries or ones that suffer from governments that reject democratic practices. Because the operating environment is risky, the United States should augment and systematize its rapid response capabilities and its post-attack procedures. In addition, Washington should ado<a name="_GoBack"></a>pt a more regional response to the terrorism threat, work more with allies like France to prepare for contingencies, and increase overall intelligence and diplomatic attention to the Maghreb and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The remainder of my testimony has three parts. First, I briefly discuss the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and assess what it means for the state of Al Qaeda today. Second, I discuss future challenges in the Maghreb, including Algeria as well as Libya, from a counterterrorism point of view. Third, I present implications and recommendations for the United States.</p>
<p><strong>I. The Benghazi Attack and the State of Al Qaeda</strong></p>
<p>The Benghazi attack exhibited several characteristics that are likely to manifest in future terrorist attacks in the Maghreb region. The attacks were:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Of Limited Sophistication</em></strong>. In contrast to the years of planning that went into the 9/11 attacks and other terrorism &ldquo;spectaculars,&rdquo; the attackers in Benghazi used military methods suggesting basic coordination and training but not more cutting-edge methods. The weapons used &ndash; RPGs, AK-47s, heavy machine guns and artillery mounted on trucks, and so on &ndash; are not advanced and are widely available. Many fighters from Al Qaeda, associated movements, and jihadist local organizations have these skills and similar weapons. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>Not Tied to Particular Events</strong></em>. Although some initial reports suggested that the attackers used the &ldquo;Innocence of Muslims&rdquo; video and associated demonstrations as justification, subsequent information makes clear this was at most a pretext. The United States was supporting efforts of the government of Libya to consolidate control over the eastern part of the country, but there was no single identifiable U.S. government action at the time that drew the ire of local terrorists: rather local jihadists simply wanted to attack U.S. personnel and facilities and did so. Even assuming the video in question mattered, there will always be similar pretexts that terrorist groups can cite to justify their attacks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Continued Vulnerability of Diplomatic Facilities</em></strong>. Diplomatic facilities, like military forces and civil aviation, remain a constant source of targeting interest for jihadist attackers. Between1998 and 2011 there were 13 deadly attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities, most of which were linked to Al Qaeda, associated movements, or those who share aspects of its ideology. There were also innumerable attempted attacks and plots that were abandoned because of effective intelligence and defensive measures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>Not a Reflection of Al Qaeda Popularity</strong></em>. Extremist Islamist movements are not particularly strong and popular in the Maghreb. In Algeria in particular they are less popular than they were in the 1990s. Rather, as discussed below, these groups take advantage of weak governments and a chaotic operating environment more than they depend on public support. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>Not Linked to U.S. Popularity</strong></em>. Some polls showed Libyans in general to be the most pro-American of all Arab states, with eastern Libya in particularly having a favorable view of Americans due to the prominent American role in helping the Libyan revolution defeat Qaddafi&rsquo;s forces.[1] Although foreigners and foreign influence are unpopular in parts of Libya and the United States is seen as supporting some factions over others, only a minority of Libyans supported the attacks, and only a minority of a minority was actively involved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>A Mix of Groups and Individuals</strong></em>. It does not appear that the Al Qaeda core orchestrated the Benghazi attack, and the assault shows how the core has spawned a variety of lesser but lethal movements. The attack involved individuals from multiple groups, making it difficult to narrow responsibility even months after the attack. In addition to Libya itself groups and factions from Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, and Algeria all seem to have been involved.[2] This sort of networked coordination, where like-minded individuals from different organizations cooperate in limited ways, is typical of Al Qaeda and associated movements as well as individuals who share no formal affiliation with the mother movement but embrace parts of its ideology.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Nature and Limits of Al Qaeda-Type Groups in the Maghreb</strong></p>
<p>Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and other groups in the region are capable of massive violence, even by the standards of the broader Al Qaeda-linked movements. During the 1990s, the Algerian civil war saw unspeakable horrors against civilians. According to Canadian diplomat Robert Fowler, who was kidnapped by AQIM, the terrorists whom he came to know were far more impressed with the late Iraqi leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who personally beheaded captives and favored bloody attacks on fellow Muslims who would not support his leadership, over the (relatively) more muted and anti-Western approach favored by Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.<a name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The various organizations in the Maghreb are divided but not necessarily hostile to one another. Many are linked in one way or another to AQIM, whose key leaders are Algerian but whose membership includes a wider range of individuals from around the region. Although AQIM has many splinters, the splinters often work together, cooperating on attacks, kidnappings, and other operations. </p>
<p>Al Qaeda affiliates and local organizations, like Ansar al-Sharia embrace some of Al Qaeda&rsquo;s rhetoric, but they are not under Zawahiri&rsquo;s thumb and many have little direct organizational relationship. &nbsp;The core organization under Bin Ladin, and now Zawahiri, used to bring people under its banner because it could offer money and useful services like training camps. Both these incentives have been diminished.<a name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> Affiliates and local groups often disagree with core leadership on a wide variety of issues, ranging from target prioritization to the degree and types of civilians who might be attacked. To the disappointment of al-Qaeda&rsquo;s core leadership, AQIM leaders have not tried hard to mobilize supporters in Europe on behalf of global jihad and have not brought the &ldquo;war&rdquo; to the Continent.<a name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> As Jean-Pierre Filiu comments, AQIM &ldquo;is the branch of the global jihad that has most clearly failed to follow its founding guidelines.&rdquo;<a name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>In addition, the highly effective U.S. drone campaign has not only removed key Al Qaeda core leaders but has also made it far harder for them to communicate with one another and exercise command over the broader jihadist movement. A tip sheet found among jihadists in Mali advised militants to avoid drones by maintaining &ldquo;complete silence of all wireless contacts,&rdquo; to &ldquo;avoid gathering in open areas,&rdquo; noting that leaders &ldquo;should not use communications equipment,&rdquo; and taking strenuous measures to root out spies, among other suggestions.<a name="_ftnref7" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> The implications for group effectiveness are staggering. In essence group leaders cannot lead as they must hide or remain incommunicado. Training on a large-scale is hard if not impossible, as large gatherings can be lethal. In combat, they cannot mass or bring in significant reinforcements. In other words, the drones turn al-Qa&rsquo;ida&rsquo;s command and control structure into a liability, forcing it to have no leaders or risk dead leaders.</p>
<p>The bad news is that affiliates themselves are filling the void created by the weakness of the core. For years Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was a strong and powerful force that influenced other jihadist groups. AQIM is trying to play that role in the Maghreb, working as we have seen with groups in Libya and Mali, and expanding ties to Nigeria&rsquo;s Boko Haram.</p>
<p>Al Qaeda and its allies are likely to see the U.S. response to the Benghazi attack as a victory and proof of America&rsquo;s cowardice. Bin Ladin had long claimed that the United States hid behind defenses and technology and pointed to U.S. withdrawals from Lebanon and Somalia after terrorist attacks as &ldquo;proof&rdquo; that the United States will fold if hit hard. The U.S. retreat from Benghazi and the handwringing in the United States risk encouraging the jihadist perception that the United States has not changed even after 9/11.</p>
<p><strong>II. Future Counterterrorism Challenges in the Maghreb </strong></p>
<p>Beyond the specific implications for Al Qaeda and associated movements in the Maghreb, the United States is likely to find counterterrorism more difficult because of the high level of instability in the region and the difficulty of working with key partners like Algeria. </p>
<p><strong>The Spread of Instability</strong></p>
<p>A functional Libyan state has never really existed. Qaddafi, rather than building one, ruled through fear and vision. Enabled by its vast hydrocarbon wealth, the Libyan economy was top-down, never allowing the private sector and an independent middle class to develop. </p>
<p>The stability of Libya today has not fundamentally changed since the September 11, 2012 attacks: anarchy does not reign complete, but neither has the government consolidated power. Since the revolution the country has had successful elections, and its economy has recovered reasonably though oil exports still remain less than pre-revolutionary levels. Islam and some sense of Libyan identity are unifying forces. In addition, Libya&rsquo;s neighbors &ndash; in contrast, to say, Syria&rsquo;s &ndash; have not actively intervened to back one faction over another. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the state still does not function: the army, the police, the judiciary, and other basic security institutions are weak and politicized.<a name="_ftnref8" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Armed gangs and militias, some of which reflect tribal or regional forces and others leftovers from the revolution, remain active almost two years of the revolution. The militias vary in type, legitimacy, and size: some have revolutionary legitimacy and local support; others are criminals masquerading as community defenders. The country lacks an effective judicial system, so militias rather than the police or authorized officials arrest those suspected of crimes, run prisons, and otherwise offer a form of rough justice.<a name="_ftnref9" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> When powerful sub-state actors oppose any particular government action, they simply seize the ministry or surround the Congress and force the government to acquiesce. These militias are both the source of many problems, particularly the lack of government authority and legitimacy, and a reflection of them. Libyan institutions and security forces remain weak and discredited, so people turn to militias; because militias are strong, Libya&rsquo;s state remains weak. On balance conflicts in Libya are limited, but they are not moving toward resolution. Because of this weakness, the Libyan state has not consolidated power in much of the country and is unable to disarm or crush groups like Ansar al-Sharia. This includes much of eastern Libya, but also much of the southern desert regions. </p>
<p>Libya is ripe for homegrown terrorists and foreign terrorist penetration. The Al Qaeda core has long included Libyans in its ranks and reportedly dispatched operatives to build an organization in the post-Qaddafi era. Jihadists of various stripes were released from jail, and some returned to Libya from exile. Homegrown groups like Ansar Al-Sharia have found room to operate. In addition, the Libyan civil war has opened up Qaddafi&rsquo;s vast arsenals to Libyan groups, and Libyan weapons have found their way not only to its neighbors like Mali but also to Gaza, Sinai, and even Syria.<a name="_ftnref10" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>More broadly, the Maghreb and the Sahel region are highly unstable. Two of Libya&rsquo;s neighbors, Egypt and Tunisia, have undergone dramatic regime changes in recent years, and at the date of this testimony Egypt&rsquo;s future course is anyone&rsquo;s guess. Sudan recently saw the secession of its southern region while other parts of the country clamor for independence. Nigeria and Mali suffer civil wars. Chad is poor, corrupt, and plagued by coups and has suffered several dramatic terrorist attacks in recent months. Borders in the Maghreb are porous. Part of this is geographic and historical &ndash; various tribes have long had economic and kinship ties that transcend borders &ndash; but the biggest problem is government weakness. So even if one country is adopting policies that make it stronger, it can still suffer violence emanating from its neighbors.</p>
<p>Not only does instability in one regional state affect its neighbors, but the Maghreb in general is an exporter of radicalism. A recent Washington Institute for Near East Policy study found Tunisia and Libya &ndash; more even than traditional producers of radicals like Saudi Arabia &ndash; was a source of suicide bombers for the Syrian conflict.<a name="_ftnref11" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> So the United States cannot write off this region in the hope that its trouble will remain geographically confined. </p>
<p><strong>Algerian Dilemmas</strong></p>
<p>The only strong regime in the region is Algeria &ndash; and the United States knows relatively little about this country and has at best a lukewarm relationship with its government. Algerians are the core of AQIM, and the government runs the most extensive spy network in the region: so we must look to Algeria to get at both the problem and the solution. Algeria was more pro-Soviet than pro-American in the Cold War, and it is prickly about its independence. Part of this is because of the secretive nature of the Algerian regime. However, Algeria has not been an intelligence or diplomatic priority. Algeria has long bristled at many cooperation requests, though intelligence cooperation did improve after 9/11 and is now far better. However, from an intelligence point of view, the Algerian government has a history of manipulating opposition groups, including violent terrorists, making it difficult to trust the information it provides. In particular, there are rumors that Algerian intelligence has worked with Iyad Ag Ghali, the head of Ansar al-Dine in Mali, and also with Mukhtar Belmukhtar. The Algerian government seeks to divert these groups against other targets and divide the movement, but in doing so it is playing with fire.<a name="_ftnref12" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Despite its relative strength, Algeria&rsquo;s own stability is in question. Predicting social revolution is notoriously difficult, but Algeria seems ripe for dramatic change. Algeria has resisted the Arab spring so far: the regime&rsquo;s ruthless and effective repression, its ability to coopt potential rivals, and the memory of a horrific civil war that left an estimated 200,000 dead in the 1990s have dissuaded citizens from taking to the streets in large numbers. However, with neighbors like Tunisia and Libya in the throes of change, a stagnant economy, a large youth population, and a government with weak legitimacy, mass protests could sweep Algeria. In particular, the recent stroke of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, though his role was largely to offer a fa&ccedil;ade for military rule, could foster a succession question that leads Algerians to demand more serious change &ndash; this may occur even before the scheduled 2014 Presidential elections. What the future holds is unclear: the United States must be prepared for revolution, instability, or continued rule by the military and security services.</p>
<p><strong>III. Implications and Recommendations for the United States</strong></p>
<p>The aftermath of the Benghazi attack and subsequent events in North Africa suggest four areas in which the United States must improve: bolstering <em>local </em>intelligence and diplomacy, augmenting apid reaction capabilities, making foreign policy reflect regional as well as state-focused concerns, and increasing overall attention to the Maghreb and surrounding areas.</p>
<p><strong>Local Intelligence and Diplomacy</strong></p>
<p>Better intelligence and good local relations are important for keeping Americans safe in different parts in the world and in the U.S. homeland. It is impossible to quantify the benefits derived, but better intelligence allows numerous plots to be disrupted, and better relations reduces hostility to the United States and improves cooperation when trying to disrupt attacks or manage their consequences. Trying to improve intelligence and relations, however, will put those Americans charged with gathering intelligence and improving relations at more risk.</p>
<p>That Benghazi was dangerous was well-known to all. Before the September 11 attack, an IED breached the U.S. consulate in Benghazi&rsquo;s perimeter. The International Committee of the Red Cross, in general a bold organization, had suspended operations there before the attack that killed Ambassador Stevens. There had been attacks on the British ambassador and on the Tunisian embassy. Other diplomats and foreign citizens were kidnapped or attacked. Indeed, the presence of terrorism was the reason for such a large intelligence presence in Benghazi.</p>
<p>Ambassador Stevens knew Libya and Benghazi well. He was popular among Libyans and his worry about the dangerous security environment in Benghazi stemmed in part from this knowledge. During my time as a staff member of the 9/11 Commission and for the House and Senate joint committee investigating 9/11, we constantly pushed for a CIA and a State Department that was more expeditionary and willing to take risks &ndash; in short, we wanted more people with the courage, experience, skill, and mindset of Ambassador Stevens. His loss was a great tragedy for our country.</p>
<p>The U.S. reaction to his death, however, risks putting undue constraints on American intelligence and diplomacy. These will ultimately undermine rather than protect U.S. interests abroad and safety at home. The bureaucratic and political lesson of Benghazi is to further confine American diplomats and spies in well-guarded parts of a capital city and remove them even more from the local population. This will keep them safer, but it will also make them less effective. They will not mingle with the local population and learn their concerns and gain their support (indeed, a recent attempted attack on Italian diplomats in Libya was foiled by an alert and supportive Libyan citizen).<a name="_ftnref13" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> They will be less able to gather intelligence on local groups. They will not take risks. And America will be less able to stop terrorism and secure its interests.</p>
<p>The United States will also become more dependent on foreign governments to provide intelligence. At times, reliance on foreign governments is beneficial &ndash; even ideal. In Morocco, for example, the local intelligence service is skilled and an important partner of the United States. In Algeria, however, the intelligence service is often suspicious of close cooperation with the United States. In countries like Libya and Mali, the intelligence services are weak and do not have access to or extensive sources in much of their countries. In such cases the United States needs to develop its own sources.</p>
<p>In Sudan, the United States closed its embassy in 1996 due to the high risk of a terrorist attack. &nbsp;From a force protection perspective, this made sense: the danger was quite real. It also meant, however, the United States lost valuable intelligence on a nascent Al Qaeda and was unable to recognize important shifts in the attitude of the government of Sudan toward counterterrorism cooperation. In the long-term the loss of this information may have cost American lives. Cutting and running from places like Benghazi may lead to similar losses.</p>
<p>The United States still needs to deploy diplomats and spies in danger zones. In many ways, they are America&rsquo;s first line of defense, learning about problems before they are apparent in Washington and cultivating assets to handle them. In addition, the United States needs local access after any attack. As the problems the FBI has incurred in its Benghazi investigation suggest, the government in Tripoli cannot ensure access to the scene of the attack and other important investigative needs. Washington also needs local sources to learn more about the identity of the attackers and possible follow-on attacks.</p>
<p>The Obama administration and the U.S. Congress &ndash; including the leadership of both parties &ndash; should make it clear that &ldquo;failures&rdquo; like Benghazi will be scrutinized, but also that we should expect losses when diplomats and spies operate in remote parts of unstable countries about which we know little where terrorist groups are also active. Surprise, mistakes, and bureaucratic confusion will be inevitable, and risk-taking should be rewarded over a caution that leaves the United States blinded, uninformed, and with few local friends as trouble develops.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid Reaction Standardization</strong></p>
<p>It would have been difficult for outside forces to have rescued Ambassador Stevens and his colleagues given the ferocity and rapid nature of the attack. And, in general, tactical warning is usually absent when it comes to terrorist attacks. One of the responses to this lack of tactical warning was to improve the defenses at U.S. embassies &ndash; the so-called &ldquo;Inman guidelines.&rdquo;<a name="_ftnref14" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> Although U.S. defenses are far from foolproof, they have saved many lives as terrorist groups have been foiled or have moved on to other targets.</p>
<p>The United States must improve its ability to respond rapidly to unexpected terrorist attacks like the Benghazi assault. Anticipating the type of motley medley of groups and individuals involved in Benghazi is difficult. Moreover, given the unsure security situation in Libya &ndash; and problems facing the United States elsewhere in the region given government weakness and limits on intelligence &ndash; we should expect regular surprises from groups and cells of which we were previously unaware.</p>
<p>In some cases even careful advanced preparation will matter little, but in others it may prove the difference between life and death. In April 2013, the Pentagon announced that the U.S. Marines had developed a rapid reaction force for North Africa that could quickly deploy 500 Marines within 12 hours.<a name="_ftnref15" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> &nbsp;This is impressive progress, but the time window needs to be smaller. This may involve deploying a smaller force &ndash; again, which means incurring more risk &ndash; but this could save many lives while enabling more expeditionary U.S. intelligence and diplomacy. Nevertheless, we must move away from the idea that spies and diplomats will have absolute protection. Even spending vast amounts of money to improve rapid reaction will still leave U.S. officials vulnerable if they are aggressively gathering information and trying to win over locals as they should be.</p>
<p><strong>A Regional Response</strong></p>
<p>U.S. diplomacy in North Africa and the Sahel area is still divided by country, and in some cases by geographic divisions (&ldquo;Near East&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Africa&rdquo;). There is no ideal bureaucratic organization that perfectly balances state-specific concerns with ones that cross borders like terrorism, but in general U.S. bureaucracies are not well coordinated across regional lines. But terrorist groups from Algeria operate in Libya, what happens in Libya shapes Mali, and what happened in Mali contributed to terrorist attacks in Algeria and Niger. Although the terrorism problem crosses borders, different ambassadors have different policies regarding counterterrorism efforts. North Africa and the Sahel region tend to be separate bureaucratically even though many of their problems are linked. The U.S. military has steadily developed and expanded regional bodies like AFRICOM to meet this challenge. Intelligence and diplomatic structures need to follow suit.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prioritizing the Maghreb and Surrounding Areas</strong></p>
<p>Often with justification, the United States has not made Algeria, Libya, Mali, and other states in the region priorities. Historic ties are limited, their energy supplies were not under threat, and their role in issues such as the Arab-Israeli dispute was marginal.</p>
<p>With the spread of Al Qaeda-focused international terrorism, however, the balance of interests has changed. The region itself is now an important theater of jihad, with AQIM playing a regional role and numerous smaller groups showing up elsewhere in the several countries. Even worse, as the Syrian civil war indicates, the region is now an exporter of terror, with volunteers from the Maghreb and weapons from Libya showing up many miles away.</p>
<p>Part of what is required is simply beefing up the U.S. diplomatic and intelligence presence in the region. This is a long-term effort, requiring training, rewards for deployment, and promotion of officers with expertise in this area. The military&rsquo;s effort with AFRICOM is one valuable step, and this should be encouraged. So too should similar efforts by the Joint Special Operations Command to work more with local officials. However, it is often cheaper and wins more friends if intelligence officials and diplomats, not soldiers, take the lead on many issues.</p>
<p>One tricky issue concerns the Algerian government. It is corrupt and brutal &ndash; and it is a strong candidate for revolution. Moreover, its intelligence services are shadowy and duplicitous. Despite all these problems, greater engagement is necessary because of Algeria&rsquo;s importance and the knowledge of the security services there. In addition, the United States is not likely to have a significant impact on the nature of the Algerian regime: because we have little leverage, an aggressive democracy promotion strategy could lose us cooperation but at the same time do little to help those who want better government in Algeria. However, the United States should lay the groundwork for better politics over time &ndash; supporting NGOs that seek to advance democracy and liberal values, promoting vocational education, and trying to bring Algerian society and its youth in particular in contact with the broader world.</p>
<p>Particularly important is hedging as we expand ties to the regime. This involves expanding the range of American contacts across government and society, consulting more with allies on joint policies, and trying to find alternative solutions to dependence on Algeria for key security issues (such as bases for U.S. drones). Such hedging allows the United States to protect its interests yet make clear to regime figures that the United States is not completely dependent on them. This both makes U.S. pressure more credible and leaves the United States in a better position to deal with the aftermath of succession or revolution.</p>
<p>More broadly, the United States will be working with weak governments like Mali and Libya as well as more established and stable ones like Morocco. Some of these governments, like Mali, will suffer coups or otherwise have unacceptable and anti-democratic practices. The United States, however, cannot simply drop its relations with regional states and then resume them a few years later when the dust settles. Although principled abstention plays well at home, in that interim we lose valuable intelligence and relationships. Steady contact and pressure to improve governance is often more useful than dramatic gestures that burn bridges but do little to help foster democracy.</p>
<p>Often the United States will need to rely more on regional allies, particularly France. U.S support for French military efforts in Mali, though grudging at first, was a valuable step given both France&rsquo;s historical ties and associated knowledge of the region and Paris&rsquo; willingness to act as the Mali problem metastasized. &nbsp;Given France&rsquo;s ties to other hotspots like Mali and Algeria, the United States should engage in serious contingency planning with France for the region to identify ways to burden share and otherwise take advantage of what each country has to offer. </p>
<p>Terrorism in and emanating from the Maghreb and Sahel regions, both of which threaten American lives and interests, will continue and may even grow in the years to come. The tragic attack in Benghazi and other subsequent terrorism in North Africa is not a reason to retreat. An effective response will require more local and regional partners, more cooperation with allies, more resources, and most of all a willingness to accept risk.</p>

<p>It is time for the international community to address itself directly to the most serious of North Korea&rsquo;s human rights violations &ndash; the prison labor camps. Situated in the mountains of North Korea, the camps are estimated to hold some 100,000 to 200,000 prisoners, including whole families, many of whom are not expected to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue has come to the fore through the combined efforts of human rights NGOs and former North Korean prisoners who have escaped the country. For several decades, NGOs, academics and journalists from the United States, Western Europe and the Republic of Korea have conducted painstaking research to unearth verifiable information about the camps and North Korea&rsquo;s overall human rights situation. They have come up with persuasive evidence despite the regime&rsquo;s efforts to conceal its conduct through denial of access. The last time a human rights organization was allowed into North Korea was in 1995 when Amnesty International visited the capital under heavy restrictions. Since that time, no human rights NGO or UN human rights expert looking into North Korea has been allowed into the country. When in 2003 the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea published its widely quoted report about the penal labor camps, updated in 2012, it was unable to set foot in North Korea. It relied instead on the testimony of those who escaped the country. Of the 25,000 North Koreans who have made their way to the South over the past ten to fifteen years, hundreds were former prisoners and former prison guards. Their testimonies were found to largely corroborate one another and have been verified by satellite photos. North Koreans hiding in China have reinforced this testimony as well. </p>
<p>The accumulated information contradicts Pyongyang&rsquo;s assertions that there are no human rights violations in North Korea nor any labor camps. &nbsp;In fact, governments and the United Nations have come to rely on the NGO information in producing their own reports and policy positions. The information will prove critical as well to any transitional justice measures developed to hold North Korean authorities accountable. The South Korean NGO, the Data Base Center for North Korean Human Rights and others have been compiling information on individual prisoners, including those currently held in the camps and on the perpetrators so that the information can become the basis for accountability in the future.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But there are serious challenges to this work that need to be addressed. Because the testimony of survivors has been damaging to North Korea, the Kim regime has sought to stem the flow of North Koreans escaping to tell their stories. It has been cracking down at the border in collaboration with China and has reduced by nearly half the number of North Koreans escaping through China to South Korea. In 2012, some 1500 reached the South as compared to close to 2,800 the year before. North Korea of late has been filling its detention centers with people trying to escape or those pushed back. Its most recent foray was into Laos to forcibly bring back a group of young North Koreans.</p>
<p>North Korean authorities have also harassed defectors in the South, sometimes by designating them enemies of the state, hacking into their computers or punishing their family members, friends and colleagues left behind. North Koreans who come out are haunted by what has happened or may happen to those with whom they were close.</p>
<p>Still another impediment to collecting information has been the lack of resources. Whether in the United States or South Korea, resources are limited when it comes to NGO research and publication of reports, even though the importance of putting the information out there could not be more evident. While new technology, the growing role of private markets, and some courageous North Koreans sending out messages have been eroding the information blockade, significant gaps remain in what we know. This includes the rate of deaths in detention, the extent to which whole families continue to be incarcerated, the status of existing camps and the numbers and punishment of North Koreans forcibly repatriated from China. Nonetheless, as a well-attended conference in Washington on the gulag concluded last year, &ldquo;We know enough&rdquo; to make a serious case meriting action.</p>
<p>Indeed, defector testimony &ndash; the main source of information about North Korea&rsquo;s camp violations &ndash; has begun to be given more weight by UN officials and governments. For many years United Nations High Commissioners for Human Rights espoused the view that it was necessary for the UN <i>itself </i>to assess the situation on the ground in order to form an independent diagnosis. Even the annual State Department Human Rights Reports on North Korea include a disclaimer about defector testimony and being able fully to assess human rights conditions. But increasingly, UN and government officials have come to realize that the gold standard of proof in which international monitors can verify on the ground every piece of information is unrealistic when a country has a deliberate closed door policy. Moreover, constantly drawing attention to the lack of fully verifiable information on North Korea can serve as a rationale for inaction and could even have the unintended effect of lending support to North Korea&rsquo;s claims that the human rights abuses reported are unfounded, emanating from those who have betrayed their country. </p>
<p>Last year, the world body made important strides on this point. After some ten years of resolutions and requests for dialogue and entry into North Korea, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in North Korea declared that human rights violations had reached &ldquo;a critical mass.&rdquo; And the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights took the decision to meet with camp survivors for the first time and called North Korea&rsquo;s human rights situation unparalleled. She declared: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the world should stand by and see this kind of situation, which is not improving at all.&rdquo; With the support of Japan and the European Union, followed by South Korea and the United States, the 47 member Human Rights Council set up a commission of inquiry in March to investigate whether North Korea&rsquo;s violations constitute crimes against humanity for which its officials could be held accountable. The vote was by consensus, reflecting a growing international unanimity around North Korea&rsquo;s widespread abuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the commission of inquiry will face many challenges. When it comes to the penal labor camps, or to forced abductions, information is available to establish crimes against humanity, but when it comes to other violations, a great deal of time and effort will be needed to put together the information required. If the commission needs to extend its work &ndash; it was allotted a year -- then Japan, the European Union, and the US-South Korean alliance should be ready to support its continuation, even though China will be on the Council next year. And these countries must be prepared to recommend strong steps if North Korea is found to be committing crimes against humanity. </p>
<p>The commission should not be considered an end in itself but rather part of a larger strategy at the UN to promote human rights in North Korea. There are a myriad of UN offices and agencies &ndash; whether on refugees, health, information, food and development, that are involved with North Korea. The entire system should be tapped to reinforce human rights where it can. Humanitarian agencies, for example, which emphasize the importance of reaching the most vulnerable in the society should at least be expected to strategize about gaining access to the camps, especially to reach children, who pose no danger to North Korea&rsquo;s security.</p>
<p>In their bilateral relations with North Korea, both the United States and South Korea have been cautious when it comes to raising human rights issues. Political and strategic issues and preoccupation with North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear program have been the main reasons. But it is also true that discussions over sensitive strategic and nuclear issues with the former Soviet Union did not stop human rights discussions. Nor do discussions with China preclude reference to human rights concerns. With North Korea the ground needs to shift and there are signs it is beginning to. In the past, the camps were always considered too provocative to talk about, but in March Ambassador Glyn Davies told the Senate that &ldquo;The world is increasingly taking note&rdquo; of North Korea&rsquo;s human rights violations, and he specifically drew attention to North Korea&rsquo;s &ldquo;elaborate network of political prison camps&rdquo; on which he commented at some length, and made reference to defector testimony &ndash; Shin Dong-hyuk and the book <i>Escape from Camp 14</i>. &nbsp;&ldquo;How the DPRK addresses human rights,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;will have a significant impact on prospects for improved U.S.-DPRK ties.&rdquo; And in his confirmation hearings, Secretary Kerry also publicly pointed to the gulags in North Korea and spoke of an American leadership role here. </p>
<p>It is now time for these pronouncements to make their way into actual policy toward North Korea. Otherwise the issues which North Korea can benefit from -- food issues or family reunification issues for which they receive payments &ndash; would principally be on the table together with possible training programs for select lawyers handpicked by Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Last month&rsquo;s G8 communique urged North Korea for the first time to address human rights violations and it specified the abductions of foreigners and the treatment of returned refugees. But it omitted reference to the camps. And the May Joint Declaration of Presidents Obama and Park Geun-hye omitted human rights principles as a foundation of peaceful reunification. Denuclearization, democracy and a market economy were mentioned but do not adequately cover those principles. </p>
<p>On this 60th anniversary of the US-ROK alliance, it is time for the US and South Korea to begin to end the exceptionalism accorded North Korea in the human rights area, and to develop a strategy with other countries and international institutions for bringing onto the diplomatic agenda international access to North Korea&rsquo;s political prisoners.&nbsp; </p><div>

<p><strong>Kenneth Lieberthal on North Korea:</strong></p>
<p>“I think the bottom line is China has moved from giving clear priority to stability in North Korea, with denuclearization very much secondary, to a current position where they accord equal weight to denuclearization of North Korea and stability of North Korea. We of course want them to have denuclearization first and foremost. I don’t think they are there yet and I think it’s going to be hard to move them beyond their current position.”</p>

<p>“The U.S. in the cyber arena is trying to drawing a bright red line. Effectively, the U.S. position is everyone conducts espionage; we don’t object to Chinese espionage, they should not object to ours. But, the U.S. does not do commercial espionage to benefit our own firms competitive position, the Chinese side does and we insist that they stop.” </p>
<p><strong>Eswar Prasad on the People's Bank of China:</strong></p>
<p>"Across the Pacific, the People’s Bank of China’s actions during the recent liquidity squeeze in China’s financial system have received a lot of attention. My interpretation is that the PBOC hung tough even while markets seemed to be undergoing a fair degree of turmoil with interbank rates shooting up, but it signals there is very significant support among the top leadership for financial sector and banking reforms."</p>
<p><strong>Eswar Prasad on U.S.-China investment:</strong></p>
<p>"The U.S. will continue pushing for better access of U.S. corporations and financial institutions, China’s markets, and also for better intellectual property protection. China, for its part, will be eager to get more clarity from the U.S. government about Chinese firms access to investment opportunities in the U.S. as well as U.S. technology."</p><h4>

<p>The potential consequences of even a minimal disruption of the flow of goods in U.S. ports would be high. The zero-inventory, just-in-time delivery system that sustains the flow of U.S. commerce would grind to a halt in a matter of days; shelves at grocery stores and gas tanks at service stations would run empty.&nbsp; A cyber disruption affecting energy supplies would likely send a shockwave through the U.S. and global economy.</p>
<p>Given the absence of standards and authorities, this paper explores the current state of cybersecurity awareness and culture in selected U.S. port facilities.&nbsp; The use of the post-9/11 Port Security Grant Program (PSGP), administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is also examined to see whether these monies are being used to fund cybersecurity projects.</p><h4>

	<img src="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/images/b/bu%20bz/buzzfeed001/buzzfeed001_16x9.jpg?w=120" alt="A BuzzFeed employee works on a computer at their office in New York February 19, 2013" border="0" /><br /><p>A new court test of fair use on the Internet appears likely, due to a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/148524483/Eiselein-v-BuzzFeed">lawsuit</a>&nbsp;filed June 7 by photographer Kai Eiselein against BuzzFeed. Eiselein, who is demanding damages that could total over $3.6 million, claims that BuzzFeed infringed his copyright in a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eiselein/4006046187/">photograph</a> he posted on Flickr in 2009 showing a soccer player heading a ball.</p>
<p>According to Eiselein, BuzzFeed included the photo without his consent in a collection titled &ldquo;The 30 Funniest Header Faces&rdquo; published in June 2010. After he sent BuzzFeed a takedown notice in May 2011, the company removed the photo and renamed the collection &ldquo;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/the-30-funniest-header-faces">The 29 Funniest Header Faces</a>.&rdquo; By that time, however, Eiselein alleges that the set of images including his photo had spread virally from BuzzFeed to dozens of other websites. Eiselein asserts that BuzzFeed is liable for contributory infringement for the photo&rsquo;s use on those sites&mdash;and on sites that published it after he registered it with the U.S. Copyright Office in late June 2011. (Copyright registration allows a plaintiff to recover very high &ldquo;statutory&rdquo; damages for subsequent infringement.)</p>
<p>In discussing copyright issues in April 2012 with <em>The Atlantic</em>&rsquo;s Alexis Madrigal, BuzzFeed&rsquo;s founder and CEO Jonah Peretti <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/where-do-all-those-buzzfeed-cute-animal-pictures-come-from/256547/">said</a>, &ldquo;I would love if every image contained some secret metadata and a way to license that image . . . But the practical reality is that it is pretty challenging, particularly in the web culture of animals and the images that spread on Pinterest and Tumblr.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">And what happens when BuzzFeed uses an image that it hasn&rsquo;t licensed? That, suggested Peretti to <i>The Atlantic</i>, can fall under the &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; doctrine of U.S. copyright law: &ldquo;Is it good for the world to have a broad definition of Fair Use where people can create new things that are transformative or that people can enjoy?&rdquo; Peretti said. &ldquo;I think it is good for the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">Under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106">U.S. law</a>, it is generally unlawful to distribute (or reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, etc.) a copyrighted work without authorization from the copyright owner. However, there is a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">fair use</a> exception &ldquo;for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, . . . scholarship, or research.&rdquo; Courts examining whether a use is fair consider a set of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">four factors</a>:</p>
<ol>
    <li style="color: #3c3c3c;">the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes</li>
    <li style="color: #3c3c3c;">the nature of the copyrighted work</li>
    <li style="color: #3c3c3c;">the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole</li>
    <li style="color: #3c3c3c;">the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">A movie critic who includes a line of dialog in a movie review is generally engaging in fair use, as is a middle school teacher who hands out photocopies of a short, properly cited excerpt of a recent news article to students in his or her classroom.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">But not all scenarios are so straightforward. When assessing the &ldquo;purpose and character of the use&rdquo; for more complex scenarios, courts in recent decades have given significant weight to whether the use was &ldquo;transformative.&rdquo; As Pierre Leval, who was at that time a federal judge in New York, wrote in an influential 1990 <i>Harvard Law Review </i><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/1341457.pdf">article</a>, &ldquo;If the secondary use adds value to the original . . . this is the very type of activity that the fair use doctrine intends to protect for the enrichment of society.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">Can a parody of a copyrighted work, made for commercial purposes, qualify as fair use? Yes, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-1292.ZO.html">ruled</a> in 1994 in <i>Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.</i>, a case that considered rap group 2 Live Crew&rsquo;s parody of the 1960s rock ballad &ldquo;Oh, Pretty Woman.&rdquo; &ldquo;The more transformative the new work,&rdquo; wrote the Court, &ldquo;the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">What about a collage constructed using copyrighted content from others? Earlier this year, the Second Circuit considered this question in a lawsuit filed by photographer Patrick Cariou against artist Richard Prince. Prince&rsquo;s work, the court explained in its <a href="http://blogs.library.duke.edu/scholcomm/files/2013/04/138475739-Cariou-v-Prince-2nd-Circ.pdf">ruling</a> [PDF] in <i>Cariou v. Prince</i>, involves &ldquo;taking photographs and other images that others have produced and incorporating them into paintings and collages that he then presents, in a different context, as his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">Cario contended that 30 of Prince&rsquo;s paintings and collages incorporated his photographs in an infringing manner. The Second Circuit, however, viewed most of the works in dispute as transformative. Prince&rsquo;s images, wrote the court, &ldquo;have a different character, give Cariou&rsquo;s photographs a new expression, and employ new aesthetics with creative and communicative results distinct from Cariou&rsquo;s.&rdquo; For 25 of the 30 works at issue in the case, the court concluded that Prince&rsquo;s incorporation of Cariou&rsquo;s copyrighted photographs was fair use.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">So where does this leave BuzzFeed as it responds to Kai Eiselein&rsquo;s allegations? The company will probably argue that its inclusion of Eiselein&rsquo;s photograph within a larger thematic collection was transformative. But that is unlikely to carry the day. The Second Circuit&rsquo;s decision in <i>Cariou v. Prince</i>&mdash;which is a binding precedent in the New York federal court where Eiselein&rsquo;s suit was filed&mdash;recognized that not all uses are transformative uses: &ldquo;A derivative work that merely presents the same material but in a new form, such as a book of synopses of televisions shows, is not transformative.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s hard to credibly claim that selecting an image to include in a list constitutes a transformation.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">That doesn&rsquo;t mean Eiselein will prevail on all of his claims. BuzzFeed will likely argue that he has misapplied the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504">statutory damage law</a> by demanding a separate payment for each alleged post-June 2011 infringement, as opposed to a single payment for the one work involved. Eiselein will also face challenges showing that BuzzFeed is liable for contributory infringement. And, there could be extraterritoriality issues as well, since many of the sites listed in the complaint are overseas.&nbsp;Eiselein will need to tie the presence of his photo on those sites to infringing acts in the United States.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">In short, Eiselein is very unlikely to get a multimillion-dollar payment from BuzzFeed. But he is also unlikely to walk away completely empty-handed. After all, as a content creator he should be able to display his work in the 21st century equivalent of a town square while also retaining the associated intellectual property rights. Put another way, uploading user-generated content to the Internet shouldn&rsquo;t require granting what amounts to a compulsory royalty-free license for anyone else who might want to use it.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 6.8pt;">Of course, it&rsquo;s best to avoid a fight over fair use in the first place. Companies like BuzzFeed would be better served by steering clear of images that aren&rsquo;t either in the public domain or easily licensable. And content creators can use mechanisms other than litigation to push social media sites to be more attuned to copyright issues.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>How can foreign aid support economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa? An assessment of this important question
must begin by recognizing that the majority of the region&rsquo;s extremely poor people live in rural areas and depend
primarily on subsistence agriculture for their livelihoods. Modern input technologies now exist to boost small-holder
productivity in these settings, where there is also commonly a need to address soil nutrient dynamics as a core component
of any agricultural productivity strategy. Among other factors, Malawi&rsquo;s progress in doubling average national
maize yields since 2005 through an aid-supported input subsidy program has prompted analysis around the merits
of increasing public finance to small-holder agriculture throughout Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overall positive average relationship between aid and economic growth is described by Clemens et al. (2012)
in their dissection of earlier high-profile studies on the same topic. In the course of their analysis, Clemens and colleagues
differentiate between two categories of aid. One is dubbed &ldquo;early impact&rdquo; aid and includes support for sectors
like roads, energy, banking, agriculture and industry, any of which might be expected to boost growth in the short to
medium term. The other category entails activities &ldquo;whose growth effect might arrive far in the future or not at all&rdquo;. This includes social sector areas like education, health, water and humanitarian assistance. The segmented
analysis of aid can be compared with more aggregate-style assessments, such as in the prominent recent paper by
Werker, Ahmed and Cohen (2009). Although the distinction between aims and effects across aid types has received
some research attention, the
topic generally still receives inadequate focus in the economics literature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, evidence is accumulating on the positive aggregate relationship between agricultural productivity
improvements, poverty reduction and economic growth. There is
therefore a need to link the &ldquo;aid and growth&rdquo; questions with the &ldquo;agriculture and growth&rdquo; questions, especially in the
African context. This includes the need for a model to analyze the structural macroeconomic dynamics that would
result from publicly financed staple food productivity improvements in rural African economies.</p>

To help understand where the United States and Russia are on nuclear arms reductions, as well as possible next steps, Brookings Arms Control Initiative Director Steven Pifer has prepared a PowerPoint presentation that outlines the New START Treaty, possible next steps on strategic forces, non-strategic nuclear weapons and missile defense issues. This PowerPoint will be useful for anyone seeking a quick introduction to the intricate world of nuclear arms control.</p>

In 2011, there were 36 million working-age (25 to 55), able-bodied<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> adults in the United States whose low wages or insecure attachment to a job in combination with their family responsibilities put them in a low-income household. By low-income we mean a household in the bottom third of the income distribution. For one reason or another&mdash;lack of a job or low wages&mdash;they have failed to achieve the American dream. In this paper we look at who they are, why their incomes are low, and what might be done to help them climb the ladder and join the middle class. Throughout the paper we compare them to their more fortunate counterparts, those in the top two-thirds of the income distribution. In 2011, the upper two-thirds had an average income of approximately $65,000 while bottom-third households had only $14,000. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We focus on short, intermediate, and longer-term policies that might improve the economic prospects of low-income households. In the short-run, what they most need is jobs. In the intermediate term, even if they were employed, many of them would not earn enough to support a family unless their wages were boosted by programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or a higher minimum wage. In the longer-term, they need better education and stronger families. Accordingly, we look at each of these four paths to moving more low-income households into the middle class, showing what each might achieve based on new estimates of the impact of each strategy on annual earnings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We look first at who is a part of this bottom third group and why their incomes are so low. Our data are for 2011 (the most recent year available) and come from the Census Bureau&rsquo;s annual survey of households in the U.S. We begin the paper with a focus on total household income. After showing that most income comes from earned sources, we then focus entirely on annual earnings adjusted for family size.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> One reason we do so is because the evidence suggests that earnings are more accurately reported in the data than income. </p>
<p>Using these data, we estimate how a return to full employment would affect their earnings. We also estimate how increasing the minimum wage to $9.00 an hour, improving education, and increasing marriages or cohabiting relationships among single parents would affect their economic circumstances. </p>
<p>In summary, we find that low-income households are disproportionately female, minority, and young. Most of these households have minor children at home, and many are headed by single parents. Their low incomes are partly due to their low wages, but even more to a lack of employment. Sixty percent of bottom-third household heads don&rsquo;t work at all or work less than full time, while only 40 percent work full time (40 hours a week for 50 weeks a year or 2000 hours in total). In the upper two-thirds, 86 percent of household heads work full time. Another reason for the greater success of the upper two-thirds is that they are more likely to have two earners in the family. In short, and not surprisingly, a scarcity of second earners combined with a shortage of work hours and low pay rates keep the bottom third out of the middle class. However, the most important reason by far for the low incomes of these households is a lack of work. They are less likely to be employed and work fewer hours when they do hold a job. We refer to this as the &ldquo;work gap.&rdquo; </p>
<p>We then do a series of simulations to determine what might help the bottom third improve their prospects and find that some of the work gap is related to the high unemployment rates that existed in 2011. Were the economy to return to full employment, the earnings of these low-income households would increase by 15 percent and the relative earnings gap between them and the upper two-thirds would narrow considerably. This 15 percent increase reflects the impact of a stronger economy on both the availability of work, including full-time work, and higher pay. While a full-employment economy will help this group of low-income households substantially, it will not move them very far up the ladder.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Larger improvements in their economic status will require that they work more (even when jobs are available), obtain more education, and/or live in families with more working-age adults and/or fewer dependent children. </p>
<p>Even when the economy is at full employment, a work gap remains. Some individuals have trouble finding work even when jobs are plentiful because of factors such as a lack of education or skills, health problems, or a prison record. In addition, some of the work gap appears to be voluntary. Based on their own reports, many of these low-income individuals have retired early (before age 55), have returned to school as adults, or are keeping house, even though, according to the data, these activities clearly leave them and their households with a low income (less than $26,000). They may be supplementing their low incomes by drawing down their savings or by getting help from friends or relatives. They are also much more dependent than more affluent households on government assistance. Overall, one quarter of their income comes from non-earned sources, especially government programs such as unemployment insurance, welfare, veteran&rsquo;s benefits, disability payments to children in the household, and educational assistance. It is possible that the availability of such non-earned income has encouraged or permitted them to work less than they otherwise would. However, we believe based on other research that such effects are relatively modest.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> </p>
<p>We also find that a higher minimum wage would have very small effects on this group. When we ask what would happen to the annual earnings of low-income households if all of the workers in these families earned at least $9 an hour, as recently proposed by President Obama, we find that the higher minimum wage would increase their annual earnings from $11,047 to $11,828, or by 7 percent<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>, although by more than this if a higher minimum wage encouraged employers to adjust their pay practices for employees earning more than the new minimum and not just for those currently earning less than $9 an hour.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> It is worth noting that 36 percent of low-income households contained at least one person earning less than the minimum wage. Other policies, such as a generous EITC and child care assistance may be even more helpful because they more strongly encourage (or facilitate) work in addition to supplementing income (or reducing household expenses). </p>
<p>Lack of education is clearly a problem for these low-income households. However, when we estimate the effects of increasing the high school graduation rate from 77 percent to 90 percent, we find that average household earnings improve by only 3 percent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These households would also tend to move up the ladder if more of them had two earners. A surprising number of them have a second working-age adult in the household who was not employed at all in 2011. We find that if these adults were employed, low-income household earnings would rise by 22 percent. This effect would be even larger if fewer of these households were single parents and thus had another potential earner in the household. For example, when we increased marriage or cohabitation between single mothers and unrelated men who&mdash;based on their age, education, and race&mdash;looked like appropriate partners, we were able to increase the incomes of all low-income households by 4 percent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The above estimates of the effects of a lower unemployment rate, a higher minimum wage, fewer high school dropouts, and more earners per family focus on the effects on the earnings of the entire group of bottom third households. The effects on the group specifically targeted (households with below minimum wage earnings, households with high school dropouts, and single mother households without a second earner) are far larger (see Figure 1).<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> </p>

<p>These estimates also do not take into account the likelihood that behavior may change in response to some of these impacts. For example, a higher minimum wage may induce more people to work. The presence of a second earner may cause the household head to work less, and so forth. Where such responses are likely to be important, we report on their likely magnitude in the sections that follow.</p>

The importance of China, and the central role of its financial system in fueling that nation&rsquo;s growth, led Douglas Elliott and Kai Yan to write a comprehensive overview of the Chinese financial system in the backdrop of the 5th&nbsp;meeting of the U.S.-China Strategic &amp; Economic Dialogue.</p>
<p>Key questions this report will address include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What is the overall structure of China's financial system? </li>
    <li>Who regulates the financial system? </li>
    <li>How do the state and party influence the allocation of credit in China? </li>
    <li>What are the major challenges for the financial system as China reforms? </li>

<p>Latin America is cooling off and it is doing so sharply.
In contrast with the 6.6 percent average growth rates
prevailing between September 2003 and September
2008—the pre-Lehman-crisis “Golden Years” for the
region—LAC-7 GDP growth rates in 2012-2013 are
decelerating significantly and reverting back to their
historical average of 3.7 percent displayed over the
last 20 years. Moreover, growth rates are cooling off
in almost every major country in the region with the
notable exception of Mexico. </p>
<p>This cooling-off has occurred in spite of the fact that
external conditions for the region are slightly more
favorable today than they were during the Golden
Years. If one takes a close look at the key external
drivers of Latin America’s growth rates identified in
Izquierdo, Romero and Talvi (2008), a model that
does a very good job of tracking out-of-sample growth
rates in the region, the picture that emerges is the
following: i) the global growth rate (the G-7 plus China)
is currently 0.8 percentage points below the observed
rates during the Golden Years; ii) commodity prices
are 40 percent above the average prices observed
during the Golden Years and very close to the
maximum values of that period; iii) emerging markets’
bond yields are close to 5 percent, a rate which is not
only significantly below the average of 7.4 percent
that prevailed during the Golden Years but also is
significantly below the minimum rate observed during
that period; and iv) capital inflows to the region—
currently running at approximately $270 billon—are
three times the average observed during the Golden
Years and higher than the maximum level achieved
during that period. </p>
<p>In fact, if we use the external factors model just
mentioned to simulate future performance under
current external conditions and those prevailing
during the Golden Years, growth rates and output
levels are consistently higher under current
conditions. This means that the current combination
of external conditions—lower global growth with
higher commodity prices and lower capital and
borrowing costs—is overall more favorable than the
one prevailing during the Golden Years. </p>
<p>How can we explain the paradox of the regional
cooling-off in economic activity in a context where
external conditions are, on average, even better than
those prevailing during the Golden Years? During
the Golden Years, external conditions improved
significantly relative to the preceding period (1998-
2003): Global growth increased from 3.0 percent to
3.8 percent, commodity prices jumped an average
of 75 percent, and the yield of the emerging market
bonds fell from an average rate of 13.5 percent to 7.4
percent. </p>
<p>Such a huge external impulse during the Golden Years
contrasts with current external conditions: They are
still very favorable, but have ceased to improve. This
is a crucial difference. Since improvements in some
key external drivers have level effects and not growth
effects, the impact on growth of an improvement in
external conditions will dissipate over time. Therefore,
the cooling-off we are seeing today is the natural and predictable outcome of external conditions that
remain very favorable for the region, even more
favorable than those of the Golden Years, but that
have ceased to improve. Given the complex dynamics
that link external factors with regional growth rates,
the effect of past improvements in external conditions
is fading away. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The previous analysis implies that we should be
careful when reading Latin America’s current growth
performance: It is not the case that the region is doing
relatively well in a more hostile external environment;
rather, the region’s growth rates are slowing down
significantly in spite of the fact that the external
environment remains favorable overall. In other
words, unless we anticipate that external conditions
will improve significantly relative to current levels, the
observed slowdown in growth rates is not an oddity
that will go away anytime soon. Rather, it is more likely
to be the “new normal” even if external conditions
remain favorable. </p>
<p>This report also explores whether idiosyncratic factors
in Latin America are playing a role in either mitigating
or contributing to the cooling-off set in motion by the
dynamics of external factors. After many years of
high growth well above the region’s historical average,
it may be the case that production possibilities
are being exhausted in a region where, in many
cases, improvements in physical and technological
infrastructure and human capital may have not kept
up with the strong output growth performance of the
past few years. If this were the case, the rate of growth
of economic activity should decline due to restrictions
in some of the inputs of the production process that
make it impossible for output to continue growing at
previous rates. For this reason, among the multiple
relevant idiosyncratic factors, we focus on identifying
countries in the region where supply bottlenecks may
have developed. </p>
<p>In order to identify countries with supply bottlenecks,
we estimate the production possibility frontier based
on the current endowments of natural capital, human
capital, physical and technological infrastructure, and
total factor productivity for each country in the region
and assess which countries are above and below the
production possibility frontier. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the countries with supply
bottlenecks—those above the production possibility
frontier according to our identification strategy—are
the ones experiencing the greatest growth reversals.
If we compare the 2012-2013 growth rates with the
growth rate of the Golden Years, the slowdown in
countries with supply bottlenecks is 2 percentage
points higher on average than in countries without
supply bottlenecks. </p>
<p>To conclude, current growth rates in Latin America are
cooling off in spite of a still very favorable external
environment as the impact of the past improvements
in external conditions on growth dissipate through
time and supply bottlenecks kick in. Even if external
conditions for the region remain favorable, unless
they start improving once again they are unlikely to be
a renewed source of stimulus for higher growth rates
as they were during the Golden Years, when external
conditions markedly improved.</p>

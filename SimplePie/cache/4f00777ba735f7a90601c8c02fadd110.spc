<p>The recently popularized “flat” interface style is not merely a trend. It is the manifestation of a desire for greater authenticity in design, a desire to curb visual excess and eliminate the fake and the superfluous.</p>
<p>In creating new opportunities, technological progress sometimes leads to areas of excess. In the 19th century, mechanized mass production allowed for ornaments to be stamped out quickly and cheaply, leading to goods overdecorated with ornament. A similar thing occurred in recent years, when display and styling technologies enabled designers to create visually rich interfaces, leading to <strong>skeuomorphic and stylistic excesses</strong>.</p>
<p>In its desire for authenticity, the Modern design movement curbed the ornamental excess of the 19th century, making design fit the age of mass production. Today, we’re seeing the same desire for authenticity manifest itself in the “flat” trend, which rejects skeuomorphism and excessive visuals for simpler, cleaner, content-focused design.</p>
<h3>The Birth Of Modern Design</h3>
<p>In 1908, Adolf Loos, an influential Austrian architect, wrote an essay provocatively titled <em>Ornament and Crime</em>. The modern ornamentalist, he claimed, was either a “cultural laggard or a pathological case. He himself is forced to disown his work after three years. His productions are unbearable to cultured persons now, and will become so to others in a little while.” Even more boldly, Loos asserted, “The lower the standard of a people, the more lavish are its ornaments. To find beauty in form instead of making it depend on ornament is the goal towards which humanity is aspiring.”</p>
<p><strong>What triggered such an attack on ornament?</strong> To understand the mindset of this pioneer of modern design, we must first form some idea of the state of design in the late-19th century.</p>
<p>The advent of the steam engine ushered in an era of mechanized mass production. As the art critic Frank Whitford writes, “Steam-driven machines could stamp, cut and fashion almost any substance faster and more regularly than the human hand. Mechanized production meant lower prices and higher profits.”</p>
<p>But while the method of production shifted from hand to machine, the style of goods did not. Most every product, from building and furniture to fabric and cutlery, was adorned in an opulent coat of ornament, built upon the grand spirit of the Renaissance.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/inkstand_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/inkstand_mini.jpg" alt="An inkstand The Great Exhibition" /></a><br />
<em>An inkstand showcased at The Great Exhibition of 1851, a celebration of the best manufacturing from around the world. The use of ornamentation here is extreme but not atypical.</em></p>
<p>Historically, handcrafted decoration has been expensive to produce, serving as a symbol of wealth and luxury. With the advent of mechanization, imitations of those same sought-after ornaments could be stamped out cheaply and quickly. Rather than stop and think about <strong>what sort of design would be best suited for mass production</strong>, manufacturers jumped at the opportunity to copy historicized styles at low cost. The result was the flood of garish, low-quality products that Adolf Loos, along with other pioneers of modern design, railed against.</p>
<p>In <em>The Decorative Art of Today</em>, famed architect Le Corbusier bluntly asserted that trash is abundantly decorated, and that, “The luxury object is well-made, neat and clean, pure and healthy, and its bareness reveals the quality of its manufacture. It is to industry that we owe the reversal in this state of affairs: a cast-iron stove overflowing with decoration costs less than a plain one; amidst the surging leaf patterns flaws in the casting cannot be seen.”</p>
<p>Montgomery Schuyler, an influential critic and journalist, condemned the heavily ornamented 19th-century facades, saying, “If you were to scrape down to the face of the main wall of the buildings of these streets, you would find that you had simply removed all the architecture, and that you had left the buildings as good as ever.”</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/harrods_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/harrods_mini.jpg" alt="Harrods store building" /></a><br />
<em>Harrods’ current building in London was completed in 1905 to the design of architect Charles William Stephens. The facade is typical of Victorian architecture. (Image: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HarrodsDay_mini.jpg" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HarrodsDay_mini.jpg">Michael Greifeneder</a>)</em></p>
<p>Louis Sullivan, the architect known as “the father of skyscrapers,” called for restraint by suggesting, “It would be greatly for our aesthetic good, if we should refrain entirely from the use of ornament for a period of years, in order that our thought might concentrate acutely upon the production of buildings well formed and comely in the nude.” Below is an image of one of Sullivan’s buildings. The ground floor is decorated, but the upper floors are surprisingly modern for a 19th-century design, especially when contrasted with Harrods’.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/carsonpiriescott_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/carsonpiriescott_mini.jpg" alt="Sullivan's Carson Pirie Scott store building" /></a><br />
<em>Louis Sullivan’s Carson Pirie Scott store was originally designed in 1899 for Schlesinger &amp; Mayer. The simplicity of the upper floors here is striking for a 19th-century building.</em></p>
<p>During the 1920s, a new movement emerged in Germany known as the untranslatable word <em>Sachlichkeit</em>, which has a sense of “factual,” “matter of fact,” “practical,” “objective.” The <em>Neue Sachlichkeit</em> movement in the field of design sought pure utility. German architect Hermann Muthesius explained how this idea of utility could be applied to style, to produce something he called <em>Maschinenstil</em>, or “machine style.” In his own words, we find examples of this style in “railway stations, exhibition halls, bridges, steamships, etc. Here we are faced with a severe and almost scientific <em>Sachlichkeit</em>, with abstinence from all outward decoration, and with shapes completely dictated by the purposes which they are meant to serve.”</p>
<p>Instead of attacking ornament, other pioneers of modern design focused on elevating functional form on a pedestal. In 1934, an exhibition curated by modernist architect Philip Johnson was held at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, titled Machine Art. On display were various pieces of mechanical equipment, such as airplane propellers and industrial insulators. <strong>The idea was to highlight beauty of form</strong> in objects that were purely functional. For the modern design movement, decoration was not necessary. Beauty and elegance were to emerge from the design of the content itself, not from a superficial coat of decoration.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/slutzky_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/slutzky_mini.jpg" alt="Slutzky teapot" /></a><br />
<em>This teapot was designed by Naum Slutzky, goldsmith, industrial designer and master craftsman of Weimarer Bauhaus. The clean, utilitarian design has not a trace of ornament &mdash; an almost mathematical solution to the given problem.</em></p>
<p>It took much of the first half of the 20th century for the Modernist movement to prevail, but eventually traditional styles and techniques were surpassed by newer approaches. In his book <em>Twentieth-Century Design</em>, Jonathan Woodham notes that the Modern aesthetic was characterized by “clean, geometric forms, the use of modern materials such as chromium-plated steel and glass, and plain surfaces articulated by the abstract manipulation of light and shade. The <strong>use of color was often restrained</strong>, with an emphasis on white, off-white, grey, and black.” Modern design had shed its opulent coat of ornament and instead sought beauty in a harmonious fusion of form and function.</p>
<p>It would be wrong to suggest that the Modern design movement on the whole can be characterized as anti-ornamental. New styles came and went, such as the popular movements of Art Nouveau and Art Deco. Some styles, such as Futurism, pushed for an exaggerated technological aesthetic, while others, such as De Stijl, sought harmony in a limited palette of colors and shapes. But underlying the outward shifts in style was the steady movement away from needless ornament, a movement towards a cleaner, more restrained form of design whose beauty lay in the style and shape of the content itself, rather than in external decoration.</p>
<h3>Digital Ornament</h3>
<p>If we compare the history of modern design with our short history of software and Web design, a parallel can be seen. In the same way that mechanized mass production resulted in an overuse of ornament, so did advances in display and styling technology result in the heavy use of decoration in software interfaces and websites. Designers in the early years of the Web were especially explorative on this front, using animation and sound together with images to produce excessively rich and often garish experiences.</p>
<p>Early operating systems with graphical user interfaces were still fairly basic in their look and feel. Granted, real-world metaphors were used where they could be, such as for images of folders to denote file directories and buttons with bevels to let the user know they could click on them. But the overall aesthetic was fairly flat and restrained. Regardless of whether the designer wanted to deliver a richer visual experience, the low resolution of the black and white displays limited them.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/os1_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/os1_mini.png" alt="Mac OS 1" /></a><br />
<em>Using only two colors for the first Mac OS graphical interface, Apple managed to convey depth, textures, buttons and icons that mimicked real-life objects. The appearance of the interface was constrained by technology, rather than by the designer.</em></p>
<p>As technology evolved, designers were granted greater visual freedom with their interfaces. With Windows XP, Microsoft introduced a colorful style throughout, giving it a somewhat physical appearance, with plenty of highlights, shadows and gradients.</p>
<p>Apple went even further with the release of Mac OS X, styling the interface with shiny plastic bubbles, brushed aluminum and lifelike icons. As time went by, the visual styling of operating systems grew in intensity. Microsoft gave Windows a shiny, transparent glass-like theme, while Apple introduced even more materials and skeuomorphic cues into its desktop and mobile systems, such as leather textures in its calendar app and realistic page-turning effects in its book reader.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/vista_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/vista_mini.jpg" alt="Windows Vista" /></a><br />
<em>The Windows Vista interface featured the Aero theme, with its shiny, glass-like window chrome.</em></p>
<p>Styles that imitate real-life objects and textures are said to be “skeuomorphs” &mdash; that is, design elements based on symbols borrowed from the real world, for the sole purpose of making an interface look familiar to the user. Recently, designers have started questioning the logic of styling a notes app as a paper pad, or of adding leather and page-turning effects to a calendar app. These effects provide visual interest, but they are also <strong>relics of another time</strong>, relics that tie an interface to static real-life objects that are incompatible with the fluidity and dynamism of digital interfaces.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/calendar_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/calendar_mini.jpg" alt="OS X calendar" /></a><br />
<em>The current version of OS X’s calendar features a stitched leather texture and torn paper edges to give the appearance of a physical calendar.</em></p>
<p>With the latest release of Windows 8, <strong>Microsoft took a brave step away from such superfluous visuals</strong>, attempting to give its operating system a wholly digital and, in its words, “authentic” look. The latest interface is built upon the principles that Microsoft developed for its earlier mobile release, presenting the user with an aesthetic that is almost wholly devoid of textures or imitations of real-life objects.</p>
<p>Instead, Windows 8 relies on typography, spacing and color to bring order and elegance to the digital canvas. Real-life effects and superfluous styles are discarded, and all that is left is simply the content itself. Much as Muthesius once submitted railway stations as examples of <em>Maschinenstil</em>, the designers at Microsoft point to examples of railway station signs as inspiration for the new Windows interface, previously known as “Metro.”</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/windows8_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/windows8_mini.jpg" alt="Windows 8 live tiles on the start screen" /></a><br />
<em>Windows 8’s start screen breaks away from the old desktop design, being composed of flat, colorful live tiles, instead of icons. The tiles are not merely a stylistic choice: They allow useful information to be displayed on the start screen in the manner of a dashboard.</em></p>
<p>The Web has seen a similar transformation over the years. Early table-based and Flash-based designs gave developers pixel-perfect control over their interfaces, and so designers did not hesitate to create visually rich containers for their content. As we began to grasp the fluidity of the new medium and to disconnect presentation from content using CSS, Web design became more restrained. Highly decorated containers could not change their width and positions easily, so designers used fewer images and relied more on simpler CSS styling to make their layouts more adaptive and easier to maintain.</p>
<p>The latest evolution of responsive design (which is to adapt a single page to suit various screen sizes and devices) as well as the move among designers to work directly in code from the start, skipping visual editors such as Photoshop, moves us even further towards a simpler, content-focused Web aesthetic, one that derives its beauty from typography, spacing and color rather than from a heavy use of textures and decorative images.</p>
<p>Most recently, Apple, the leader of skeuomorphism, has taken its first step towards digital authenticity with the latest release of its mobile operating system, iOS 7. Gone are the stitched leather textures and ripped paper edges, replaced by a minimalist, mostly flat interface, with colorful, simplified icons and semi-translucent surfaces.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ios7_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ios7_mini.jpg" alt="Comparison between Apple's iOS 6 and iOS 7 interfaces" /></a><br />
<em>Apple’s iOS 7 is a radical turn away from skeuomorphism. The old design of iOS’ Calculator app is on the left, and the one for iOS 7 is on the right. The grainy texture, bevelled buttons and shiny glass are all gone, replaced by a mostly flat, functional interface.</em></p>
<h3>Authentic Design</h3>
<p>What ties the pioneering days of Modern design to the current shift in software and Web design is the desire for authenticity. This drive towards greater authenticity is what moved designers to scrape away ornament from their work over a hundred years ago, and this force is what is moving digital design today towards a cleaner, more functional aesthetic. <strong>But what exactly makes design “authentic”?</strong></p>
<p>Authentic design aims to pierce through falsehood and do away with superfluousness. Authentic design is about using materials without masking them in fake textures, showcasing their strengths instead of trying to hide their weaknesses. Authentic design is about doing away with features that are included only to make a product appear familiar or desirable but that otherwise serve no purpose. Authentic design is about representing function in its most optimal form, about having a conviction in elegance through efficiency. Authentic design is about dropping the crutches of external ornament and finding beauty in pure content.</p>
<p>In authentic design, style is not unimportant, but it is not pursued through decoration. Rather, beauty of form depends on the content, with the style being a natural outcome of a creative solution. As Deyan Sudjic commented on the design of the iconic Anglepoise lamp, “How the lamp looks &mdash; in particular the form of its shade &mdash; was something of an afterthought. But that was part of its appeal. Its artless shape gave it a certain naive innocence that suggested authenticity, just as the early versions of the Land Rover had the kind of credibility that comes with a design based on a technically ingenious idea rather than the desire to create a seductive consumer product.”</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/anglepoise_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/anglepoise_mini.jpg" alt="The Anglepoise lamp" /></a><br />
<em>The design of the Anglepoise lamp is an ingenious solution to a real problem. But the resulting form, which is an effective solution, turns out to have its own aesthetic allure.</em></p>
<p>In digital design, authenticity means a few things, which can roughly be summarized as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embrace the digital look.</strong></a><br />
We do not have to mimic textures such as metal, wood and leather on a computer display. They are not what a digital interface is made of, so pretending that it is makes no sense. This does not mean that a design should have only plain flat backgrounds colors &mdash; rather, it means we should not try to imitate or be restricted by textures from the real world.</li>
<li><strong>Do away with skeuomorphism.</strong></a><br />
A digital book need not imitate physical paper as one turns the page, nor does a note-taking app need to look like a physical paper pad, with a leather cover, torn edges and a handwriting-styled font. Skeuomorphism is not always bad, but it always introduces needless constraints on the interface. For example, while a paper pad is static and one dimensional, a digital interface need not be; but as long as the interface is made to imitate a paper pad, it has to bear the constraints of the physical metaphor.</li>
<li><strong>Make the style content-centered.</strong></a><br />
Focus on the content rather than on its styling and decoration. You might think this point is trite, but how many times have you seen an off-the-shelf theme on a website? A theme is always built on dummy content and so, by its very nature, could never be an optimal representation of the content it will eventually hold. Building themes with dummy text pushes the designer to focus on styling and decoration, rather than on content, because there is no content yet to work with. Only when you work with real content can you begin to truly transform function into form.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Not Minimalism</h4>
<p>Design whose beauty lies in function is not the same thing as <del>minimalism</del> minimalist style. With the former, the designer seeks to remove the superfluous, to make the product easier to understand, to make it perform better and to <strong>make the most of its medium</strong>. The latter seeks to create a minimalist aesthetic, to give the object an aura of simplicity and cleanliness. One is a fundamental principle of design, the other a stylistic choice.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/flatui_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/flatui_mini.png" alt="Flat UI" /></a><br />
<em>The <a href="http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/" title="http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/">Flat UI</a> theme kit, by Designmodo, is an outward representation of the underlying shift towards authentic design. But as a style, “flat” is a choice, not a necessity.</em></p>
<p>It would be a mistake to rigidly apply a minimalist design aesthetic to an interface as a style in the hope of making the interface simpler and more digitally “authentic.” For example, ruthlessly eliminating visuals such as shadows, colors and varied background styles would not necessarily make an interface easier to use. In some cases, it would achieve the opposite by undermining hierarchy and focus, which were established by those very shadows and background colors.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/outlook2013_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/outlook2013_mini.png" alt="Outlook 2013" /></a><br />
<em>Outlook 2013’s interface was updated to fit Windows 8’s modern theme. But with the interface being flattened, all of the content and menus were merged onto a single white plane, becoming more cluttered as a result.</em></p>
<p>In <em>The Laws of Simplicity</em> John Maeda posits, “The simplest way to achieve simplicity is through thoughtful reduction. When in doubt, just remove. But <strong>be careful of what you remove</strong>.” The final warning is important. Removing things often leads to simplicity merely because the user has fewer items to process. But removing visual cues that help the user mentally process the interface &mdash; such as graphical elements that group items, that differentiate buttons and labels and that make things stand out &mdash; could do exactly the opposite by giving the user more work to do. So, rather than guide the design by style, guide it by principle.</p>
<h4>Why Authentic Design Matters</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.simplebots.co" title="http://www.simplebots.co">Rise</a> app is a perfect example of digitally authentic design. The alarm clock is a problem that has already been solved, but Simplebots decided to tackle the concept from scratch, rethinking the interface in the context of a purely digital canvas.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/rise_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/rise_mini.jpg" alt="Rise app" /></a><br />
<em>In the Rise app, the user sets the time with an innovative full-screen slider, with the background color changing to reflect the color of the sky.</em></p>
<p>Rise’s interface features a full-screen slider, with a background color that changes to reflect the color of the sky at the time you’ve set. It shows no attempt to mimic a physical clock or a physical slider or real-life textures. Instead, the designers have fully embraced the touch canvas of the mobile phone, creating an experience that is designed from the ground up to make the most of its medium. The innovative design not only makes for a great user experience, but elevates the app above others in the marketplace.</p>
<p>An interface like Rise’s is only possible when you tackle a design problem wholly within the context of the digital canvas, rather than by translating solutions from the real world. The digital screen allows for abstract forms, animation, bright colors and uniform shades. It need not be limited to a subdued palette or static representation, nor must it be bound to skeuomorphic forms. By figuring out how best to represent content using the pixel grid, we can arrive at better, simpler solutions, innovative interfaces that feel at home on the screen, designs that provide a better user experience and that stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>The recently popularized “flat” design style may be a trend, but it is also the manifestation of a desire for greater authenticity in design, a desire to curb superfluous decoration and to <strong>focus on the content itself</strong>. Technological progress sometimes leads to excess, as mechanized mass production did in the 19th century when ornament became overused, and as display and styling technologies did during the early years of Web and software design. But ornamental excess was curbed over time by the pioneers of Modernism, who sought beauty in function, and today’s excesses in software will in time be curbed by an underlying desire for authenticity in design.</p>

<p>In my career as a freelance illustrator, map-making has become a favorite specialty of mine. With each map assignment, I virtually travel across the globe, visiting places I’ve never been. Most recent was a “trip” to New Zealand for a sampling of local Wellington beer for <a href="http://draftmag.com/">Draft Magazine</a>. My maps are designed to appear next to magazine stories about trips to faraway places, or about the best restaurants in a nearby neighborhood.</p>
<p>I create them in Adobe Illustrator, and I relish the research process as much as working on the drawings themselves.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/draftmag-illustrated-map_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/draftmag-illustrated-map_mini.jpg" width="500" height="298" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>There was a time when map assignments arrived from clients in a FedEx envelope, full of research, including Xerox’ed maps taped together and marked up with a highlighter. Back then, I could search online for photo references, but it certainly wasn’t the 3-D experience of flight that it is now. With Google Earth, I can get the lay of the land and see the heights of buildings and the way green spaces meet city blocks. These details give me a sense of place that fires my imagination.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wellington-satellite-google_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wellington-satellite-google_mini.png" width="500" height="261" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>I received the brief for Draft Magazine’s project from art director Kevin Robie, with a list of publications to highlight, a preliminary layout and a few reference maps. <strong>My starting ritual is to create a Google “My Places” map</strong>, with a marker for each landmark, shop or restaurant highlighted in the story.</p>
<p>Here are the steps I took:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into Google, and click on “Maps.” Click on the “My Places” button and then the “Create Maps” button.</li>
<li>Name the map. Choose to make it “Public” or “Unlisted.” Hit “Done.”</li>
<li>Search for a location using the search box, and then click “Save to My Maps.” From here, I can choose which map to save it to and view the map.</li>
<li>Once I have saved locations on my map, click the “Edit” button, and then click on the location that I want to edit in the list. A callout box will appear on the map, allowing me to change the location’s title and description and even the color and style of the pin.</li>
<li>With the map set up and Google Earth installed, I can choose to look at locations in “Satellite” mode or “Street View,” and then try the “Earth” view right from my browser to fly in and get a feel for the heights of buildings and the topography of the city.</li>
<li>Download a KML file of my map by clicking the KML link or the Google Earth icon under the title of the map. Double-click the file to launch Google Earth on my system with my map preloaded.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/street-photos_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/street-photos_mini.png" width="500" height="270" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>Whether you explore your map in the browser or from the <a href="http://www.google.com/earth/index.html">Google Earth</a> app, you can fly around, visit street level and see the Panoramio photos taken in the neighborhood you’re visiting. If you’re lucky, the location you’re researching will have a panoramic virtual tour of the interior space. Street-view images can get out of date, so I always visit the websites of any businesses or restaurants that are being highlighted. I find that the Google Earth and satellite views give me a sense of a city or neighborhood that <strong>helps me to envision the overall look of the map</strong>.</p>
<p>Google has recently released the Google Maps Engine (currently in beta), which offers further customization, such as the ability to draw lines to create a virtual walking tour. If 3-D aerial views of buildings are what you’re after, Bing has a nice <a href="http://www.bing.com/blogs/site_blogs/b/maps/archive/2012/05/08/new-imagery-amp-streetside-coverage-on-bing-maps.aspx">Bird’s Eye</a> view that can supplement your research.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/reference-folder_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/reference-folder_mini.png" width="500" height="192" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>I took screenshots and kept my reference images organized in the project folder on my system. In Illustrator, I created a CMYK document at the size of Draft Magazine’s pages. I took maps provided by the client, along with screenshots of my Google Map views, and <code>File &#8594; Place</code>’d them in the document.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/illustrator-reference-maps_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/illustrator-reference-maps_mini.png" width="500" height="296" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>Place-linking images (as opposed to embedding them or pasting them from the      clipboard) in Illustrator keeps the document’s size small &mdash; but it’s important to have a strategy for keeping up with the images on your system. If you move an image to a different location, the next time you open the document, Illustrator will ask you to find and relink the image that you moved.</p>
<p>I created a few more layers above my locked reference layer for the map’s background and the streets, and one for the dots that mark the locations I was highlighting.</p>
<p><strong>The first stage of creating the map</strong> was to figure out the composition. In this instance, art director Kevin Robie provided his page layout with the map indicated. Once I’d drawn the location dots and some simple shapes indicating the background of the map, I could begin to see the shape and scale of the map and the space available for illustration.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pen-tool-illustrator_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pen-tool-illustrator_mini.png" width="500" height="265" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>At this early stage, I worked in grayscale and I traced the layout of streets with the Pen tool. I may not have included all of the streets I was drawing in the final map; sometimes the pattern of streets provides a grid texture that I can work with later. I tried to strike a balance by creating a basically accurate map that also functions as an illustration. I’ll take some liberties if it makes the information more legible and the art more attractive on the page.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/layers-illustrator_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/layers-illustrator_mini.png" width="254" height="246" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>With my background shapes isolated on their own layer, I clicked the Target icon in the layers panel and lowered the opacity of the background shapes layer to see the map reference below. <strong>With the basic map area laid out, I began searching for photo references</strong> to help me decide on a color palette and imagery for the different locations.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/illustrator-icon-reference_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/illustrator-icon-reference_mini.jpg" width="500" height="309" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>Each location I was highlighting needed an icon illustration that’s emblematic of the place. Food bloggers, such as <a href="http://foodiegemsofwellie.com/">foodiegemsofwellie</a>, are a lifesaver to me because, although I can read about the specialty pies on <a href="http://www.hashigozake.co.nz/">Hashigo Zake</a>, that website has no images to help me visualize the size and presentation of the dish that this bar is famous for.</p>
<p>One of the great advantages of working in Illustrator is that I have my own spot illustration elements, which I’ve collected from previous projects. I have glasses, bottles of beer, pizza and foliage that I can scale, recolor and rework to suit any project &mdash; a major time-saver.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/color-swatches-illustrator_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/color-swatches-illustrator_mini.png" width="500" height="264" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>I also collect color palettes from previous projects, which I save in the Swatches Panel libraries (click <code>Swatch Libraries &#8594; Save Swatches…</code>, and then access them under <code>User Defined</code>). Over the years, I’ve learned not to assume that a color on screen will print accurately, so I’ll always check it against a physical sample.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pantone-plus-bridge-guide_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pantone-plus-bridge-guide_mini.jpg" width="500" height="199" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>I used the <em>Pantone Plus Color Bridge</em> guide fan book to help me choose CMYK colors from the <strong>right-hand CMYK column</strong> (I ignored the spot colors on the left because this was a CMYK job). The bridge guide also shows the equivalent spot colors, hex codes and RGB values for each color. Illustrator’s swatch libraries for Pantone books can be found in the Swatch Libraries menu, under “Color Books.” Once I find a color I like in the fan book, I add it to my swatches panel.</p>
<p>With colors loaded on my swatches panel and photo references gathered, I was ready to start building the illustration. I did most of my work from beginning to end in Illustrator. With other types of illustration, I may start with pencil sketches, but maps really lend themselves to being “built” from solid shapes and lines in Illustrator.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/illustrator-drawing-trees_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/illustrator-drawing-trees_mini.png" width="500" height="315" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>After flying around Wellington in Google Maps, I knew I’d be surrounding the map with a border of green trees, so I started drawing circles in shades of green and trying out different tree shapes for the border. I typed notes about an icon’s subject matter directly on the map to save my ideas for later.</p>
<p>Keeping the tree decoration on its own layer <strong>allowed me to use a layer clipping mask in Illustrator</strong> to quickly crop the edges of the trees to fit the map. Later, I got rid of the layer mask and used individual clipping masks on separate groups of trees so that I could vary their placement. (See the resources at the end of this article for masking tutorials.)</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/lettering-for-illustrator_mini.png" width="500" height="319" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>I turned off the layer with notes and <strong>printed out a preliminary map in grayscale</strong>, at a slightly larger than final size. I laid the printout on my light box and drew letters in ink multiple times to find some that I could combine to make labels for the different locations. I’d later make a 300-DPI TIFF scan of the lettering in Image Capture.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/image-trace-illustrator_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/image-trace-illustrator_mini.png" width="500" height="717" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>Next, I opened the TIFF in Illustrator and “Image Trace”’d it in black and white, with “Ignore White” turned on. I’ve saved a custom Image Trace preset in Illustrator that I use specifically for my handwriting, to retain as much of the original line character as possible. All of the detail settings are very high, and noise is at the lowest setting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mode: Black and White</li>
<li>Threshold: 128 (default)</li>
<li>Paths: 97%</li>
<li>Corners: 90%</li>
<li>Noise: 1 px</li>
<li>Check: “Create Fills,” “Snap Curves to Lines” and “Ignore White”</li>
</ul>
<p>To save these settings as a custom preset for future use, click the “Manage Presets” button (circled above) on the Image Trace panel, and choose “Save as New Preset.”</p>
<p>After ungrouping the expanded trace, I started assembling the letters into place names and grouping them. Then, I copied and pasted the names onto a separate layer in my map file.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/envelope-distort-illustrator_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/envelope-distort-illustrator_mini.png" width="500" height="272" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>The title was created from a line of type and a rectangle, using <code>Object &#8594; Envelope Distort &#8594; Make With Warp &#8594; Rise</code>. I kept a copy of the “live” envelope objects off to the side, so that I could always adjust the amount of distortion. Then, I chose <code>Object &#8594; Expand…</code> to convert the warped type to paths, so that I could change colors and edit further.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/illustrator-map-sketch_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/illustrator-map-sketch_mini.png" width="500" height="275" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>I sent my Illustrator sketch positioned in the layout to the art director. At this stage, I showed him the composition and color palette, with a few details to show where I was going with it. In Illustrator, <strong>changing the colors or shuffling the composition elements is easy</strong>, so I always let the client know that this work is preliminary, even though it looks solid and not “sketchy.” The icons were plain shapes, which allowed me to get my ideas across without investing time in details that might need to be changed later.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I’ll include pencil sketches of the icons, placed on the Illustrator map; in this case, I’d worked with Kevin enough that I could use Illustrator shorthand, and he would know the level of detail to expect from my finished work.</p>
<p>I saved separate AI files for the sketch, comp and final version, so I could always go back and grab something I’d gotten rid of if I decided later that I needed it. Illustrator files are small enough to make this possible without eating up much storage space.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Laura-Coyle-WellingtonNZ-map_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Laura-Coyle-WellingtonNZ-map_mini.jpg" width="500" height="717" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>Once I’d finished detailing the final illustration, I got rid of any unused colors on my color palette (<code>Panel Options &#8594; Select All Unused</code>, and delete). Then, I saved the color palette for future use (<code>Swatch Libraries Menu &#8594; Save Swatches</code>). I can always access it from the same menu under “User Defined” later. Then, I went to “Select All” and chose <code>Edit &#8594; Edit Colors &#8594; Convert to CMYK</code>. Now, if I clicked on a color in my artwork, I could see the CMYK formula in the color panel.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, I exported a high-resolution CMYK TIFF of the artwork.</strong> I could bring this into Photoshop if I needed to make any final adjustments or convert it to RGB for the website. I sent the final TIFF, rather than the Illustrator file, to my client. The final AI file is complex and made up of so many tiny parts that it would be safer for me to do any necessary edits myself. I learned that lesson after receiving a printed cover on which I found my main character’s ear unintentionally floating away!</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/draft-magazine_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/draft-magazine_mini.jpg" width="500" height="311" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>After a project, I’m always excited to see the final work in print. I filed the magazine away in the hope of getting to see New Zealand some day. In that case, I’ll be tearing out the page.</p>

<p>Our anticipation was building. Between defining our language translation app, sketching it out, obsessively designing and iterating, and juggling other projects &mdash; all covered in the <a href="http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2013/07/04/top-ten-app-part-1-idea-and-design/">first part of our case study</a> &mdash; we had been working on Languages for close to a year. It was finally go time.</p>
<p>Even the coolest app in the world is doomed to swiftly descend into the abyss of obscurity if no one knows about it. So, part two of our journey is all about marketing. It turns out that you don’t need a huge marketing budget to get into the top 10 in the App Store.</p>
<h3>Seriously, Marketing?</h3>
<p>I never thought of myself as a marketer. To me, “marketing” sounded like a dirty word. But when I was building my first app, Grades, I actively watched the indie developers who were consistently building hit apps, and sure enough, along with factors such as delightful design and amazing execution, a key factor to consistent success was great marketing.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/getting-in-top-ten-of-apps_500_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/getting-in-top-ten-of-apps_500_mini.jpg" alt="getting-in-top-ten-of-apps_500_mini" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137798" /></a></p>
<p>The cool part is that, as I found out, marketing doesn’t have to be about spam, meaningless buzzwords or sleazy Twitter follower generators, and it certainly doesn’t have to be expensive. If your product is great, marketing can be genuine, fun and free. Ultimately, it becomes a part of everything you do, without your even realizing it.</p>
<h3>Marketing Starts From Day 1</h3>
<p>We often have the misconception that marketing is what you do once you’ve launched a product. Too many people have come up to me after a talk or after reading one of my articles and said, “We just launched our app and got a few small blogs to write reviews, but those have generated only a few sales. What’s the magic trick that gets an app on The Verge or featured by Apple?”</p>
<p>Sorry, no magic tricks here. Just a lot of hard work, and that takes a long time. The good news is that it’s completely achievable, but you can’t wait until your app is ready to launch to get started.</p>
<h3>Do It Yourself</h3>
<p>You would think that the ideal situation is to have a boatload of cash and hire a public relations (PR) firm.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>You &mdash; the designer, the developer, the founder &mdash; are the very best person to market the app.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ol>
<li>The press love to hear directly from the folks in the trenches.</li>
<li>A lot of PR agencies don’t get the nuances of app marketing.</li>
<li>Relationships with journalists is the currency of PR. Even if a PR firm landed you some great articles, they would take those relationships with them, leaving you with no long-term benefits. If you do it yourself, you will be cultivating those relationships, making future launches a lot easier.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/do-it-yourself-marketing-large-view_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/do-it-yourself-marketing_500_mini.jpg" alt="do-it-yourself-marketing_500_mini" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137799" /></a></p>
<p>There are definitely some exceptions. I know some marketers who really understand the space and who deliver results. But in general, doing it yourself is better, especially if you are in this game for the long haul.</p>
<h3>Make Friends</h3>
<p>Later in this post, we’ll talk about marketing tactics &mdash; crafting our pitch, drawing lists of blogs and so forth &mdash; but those tactics don’t mean a whole lot unless you understand something very fundamental about grassroots marketing: It’s all about the people.</p>
<p>The problem is that we view big websites like The Verge as monolithic black boxes into which we insert a pitch and hope for the best. But who runs The Verge? Real people with flesh and bones. Who runs the App Store? People. How do you get featured? By winning the hearts of those people.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jerols/remarkable-iphone-devs"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/make-friends_500_mini.jpg" alt="make-friends_500_mini" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137803" /></a></p>
<p>These days, getting my apps featured isn’t that difficult. Why? Because over the past four years, I have made friends with people at almost every major venue that features apps, including Apple. Now, whenever I release a product, I can direct message a few people on Twitter and send a few emails and, assuming my product is at the caliber that my friends have come to expect from me, be fairly confident that launch day will go pretty well. That’s the power of people-focused marketing.</p>
<p>Remember that just a few years ago, I was an obscure college freshman, starting at ground zero. No apps. No friends. Not even any connections. So, if I can do it, anyone can.</p>
<p>How did I do it?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>List influential people.</strong><br />
It started by making a list of influential folks in the iOS industry: app designers and developers (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/drbarnard">David Barnard</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/phillryu">Phill Ryu</a>, etc.), technology journalists who cover apps, folks at Apple. Limiting this list to tech journalists would have been a huge mistake. In the app world, the top players know each other, so a connection with one influential app developer could very well lead to a connection with Apple or the press &mdash; and the iOS community is chockfull of great people who love to share their experiences. I&#8217;ve compiled Twitter lists for top <a href="https://twitter.com/jerols/remarkable-iphone-devs">app makers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jerols/best-of-the-press">app journalists</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/jerols/apple-employees">Apple employees</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Actively monitor.</strong><br />
I actively watched what these people were doing, looking for opportunities to <strong>connect in tasteful ways</strong>. Suppose Phill Ryu had a question on Twitter that I could answer, or Ellis Hamburger wrote an article on The Verge that I really enjoyed &mdash; I took those opportunities to engage with folks on their turf. I never spammed them with my apps or my blog &mdash; once someone likes you, they’ll naturally check out your stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Go where they are.</strong><br />
Everyone is on Twitter, so I made sure that my profile there looked interesting and I got active. I went to conferences such as the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) and South by Southwest and actively got out of my shell to meet the people around me and the people on my lists. Because I was a designer, I also hung out in communities like <a href="http://dribbble.com/jerols">Dribbble</a> and <a href="http://forrst.com/people/jerols">Forrst</a> to connect with other designers. Finally, I occasionally emailed influential people &mdash; I didn’t spam them, but I would say something nice about an article they wrote or ask a close-ended question about something they were interested in (close-ended because you are not likely to hear back on questions that require long answers).</li>
<li><strong>Do cool stuff.</strong><br />
If you aren’t building cool apps that are innovative and well designed, then gaining respect in the app community will be tough, and respect is a pillar of friendship. You don’t necessarily need to have apps in the App Store, though. I made a lot of my connections before my first app ever launched. A big reason for that is that I blogged and tweeted about what I was learning from app developers about making successful apps, and I posted very introspective thoughts about developing my first app. That caught people’s attention, and doing that well is a great way to gain respect before you’ve actually “made it” in the industry. This is important, because if you’ve gotten someone’s attention by talking to them at a conference or by engaging them on Twitter, then you need to gain their respect in order for them to take the leap of following you on Twitter (which, as weird as it sounds, can be a big deal in establishing a lasting friendship).</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate long-term friendships.</strong><br />
Once I established a connection with someone, I cultivated it by discussing issues on Twitter, in email and at conferences, giving them beta access to my apps, requesting feedback on projects (especially high-profile ones), and saying something nice about them once in a while &mdash; I don’t know one human being who doesn’t have at least a smidgen of ego.</li>
</ul>
<p>This might sound a bit manipulative when broken down like that, but it’s really just about being a friendly, interesting person and going out of your shell a bit to meet the great folks at the top of our industry.</p>
<p>I like how David Barnard put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There are some really cool people in this industry. If all you do is beg for coverage, you’re missing out on getting to know some great folks.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you follow this advice, then the advice below will produce great results. If not, I can’t guarantee a whole lot of fruit from the more tactical stuff.</p>
<h3>Launch Plan: Concentrated Blast</h3>
<p>The App Store is not the Web. On the Web, you can launch softly, get some articles here and there, and build your user base over time.</p>
<p>If you are trying to sell a mass-market app for $0.99, then scattered marketing doesn’t work. To get hundreds of thousands of downloads, you need to make an effort and get the app to “chart,” to blast up the App Store’s sales charts. Once your ranking is high enough, you will experience a snowball effect because the charts are where most people look for apps.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we prepared as much as we could before the launch in order to make the blast as concentrated as possible.</p>
<h3>Building Buzz</h3>
<p>A couple months before the launch, we started building anticipation. The goal was to collect email addresses, Twitter and Facebook accounts that we could reach come launch day.</p>
<h4>Blogging</h4>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/writing-blog-posts_500_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/writing-blog-posts_500_mini.jpg" alt="writing-blog-posts_500_mini" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137804" /></a></p>
<p>We started by writing blog posts about the making of Languages. We posted our <a href="http://tapity.com/iphone-app-design/user-experience-mapping-strategic-design-part-3/">UX mapping process</a>, <a href="http://tapity.com/iphone-app-design/where-we-are-with-languages/">progress reports</a>, rants on <a href="http://tapity.com/iphone-app-design/gestures/">gestures</a>, among other things. Blogging played a large role in building our brand and credibility with previous apps, but a lesser role for this launch. It was probably still worth it, though, because continuing to build your blog’s readership is always good.</p>
<h4>Twitter</h4>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/create-twitter-account_500_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/create-twitter-account_500_mini.jpg" alt="Tweetbot, my Twitter client of choice." width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137805" /></a></p>
<p>I like to use my personal Twitter account (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/jerols">@jerols</a>) most of the time, but we decided to create a <a href="http://www.twitter.com/languagesapp">@languagesapp</a> Twitter account to make it easy for us and others to refer to the app without having to link to it (“Putting the final touches on @languagesapp”). My followers could then click the Twitter user name to find out more information about it. While it was hard to remember to post consistently to the @languagesapp account, I posted a teaser screenshot once in a while and retweeted it from my personal and company accounts, giving the @languagesapp account more exposure.</p>
<p>With fairly minimal effort, we were able to garner about 500 followers for the account.</p>
<h4>Facebook</h4>

<p>I’m honestly not a Facebook marketing expert and didn’t spend a lot of time experimenting with it, but I did set up a page and post screenshots and status updates once in a while. It got about 50 likes, half of which were friends. I could have experimented more and gotten a lot more likes, but it didn’t seem like the most effective use of my time.</p>
<h4>Dribbble</h4>

<p>As a designer, it was only natural to post my UI mockups to <a href="http://dribbble.com/jerols">Dribbble</a>, a design community in which you can get great feedback and sometimes get viral sharing of your designs. I’m not a Dribbble pro, and my designs have never made it to Dribbble’s famous front page, but I did get some valuable feedback and a few thousands views to boot.</p>
<h4>Teaser Website</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.languagesapp.com/old"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/build-teaser-website_500_mini.jpg" alt="Build a teaser website." width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137808" /></a></p>
<p>We always build a <a href="http://www.languagesapp.com/old">teaser website</a> a month or two before launch to collect email addresses of people who would like to know when the app launches. About 200 folks subscribed. Not something to write home about, but every little bit helps. Some of the subscribers were influencers in the industry, which is always good.</p>
<h3>Pitching The Press</h3>
<p>Two weeks to go. Pitch time. I was fortunate enough to have been able to show an early build to some of my journalist friends at the WWDC, so I already had some really hot doors to knock on.</p>
<h4>Warm Calls</h4>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/warm-calls_500_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/warm-calls_500_mini.jpg" alt="Warm calls" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137809" /></a></p>
<p>Most of the journalists I knew personally already followed me on Twitter, so, in most cases, the best way to initiate the pitch was to send them a direct message on Twitter, teasing them with a screenshot and asking whether they wanted to play with a prerelease build. These guys are super-busy, so I didn’t hear back from all of them, but many of them were on board.</p>
<p>We used <a href="https://testflightapp.com">TestFlight</a> to send out prerelease builds to the press. Most of them had TestFlight accounts already, so getting a build to them was pretty easy. Later on, once the app was finalized and approved by Apple, we replaced TestFlight with promo codes in our pitches, which are more convenient. (Promo codes are valid after the app is approved by Apple but before it is available to the public.)</p>
<p>After sending out the builds, I sent the journalists personalized thank-you notes, which also communicated the basic pitch and hinted at some advanced features to check out.</p>
<p>Our programming partner, Sonico, also had some great connections. So, they contacted the journalists with whom they had the strongest relationships, and we contacted ours.</p>
<h4>Cold Calls</h4>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cold-calls_500_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cold-calls_500_mini.jpg" alt="Cold calls"" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137810" /></a></p>
<p>While warm calls are ideal, I’ve had some success with cold calls &mdash; i.e. pitching journalists and individuals with whom I don’t already have a strong connection. I created a spreadsheet with all of the websites I wanted to pitch and prioritized them by how influential I perceived them to be. For the really big websites, I identified the best individual journalists to contact and sent them a personalized pitch. For the smaller websites, I generally just wrote to their <code>tips@</code> email address and only personalized the “Hey, [website’s name] team” greeting.</p>
<p>As expected, we got only a few responses from the cold calls, but it was still worth it.</p>
<h4>When Personalization Goes Wrong</h4>
<p>I generally personalize the greeting and first sentence of my emails, especially for journalists whom I know. Unfortunately, this time, I had a “brilliant” idea: to refer to the journalist’s website in the middle of the email, to make it even more personal!</p>
<p>Bad idea. I forgot about that reference in one of my pitches and left in the name of a competing website. Talk about embarrassing and unprofessional. From then on, I decided to keep it simple. Don’t include personalized references anywhere but at the beginning of the email, and always double-check before sending! Thankfully, the journalist was a friend and took it well.</p>
<h4>The Pitch</h4>
<p>Rather than talk about what I think makes for a good pitch, I’ll just show you mine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey [journalist’s name],</p>
<p>[Personalized message to the journalist and introduction to the pitch.]</p>

<p>It certainly wasn’t perfect (if you want to learn how to make a perfect pitch, you should probably read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pitch-Perfect-Practical-Professional-ebook/dp/B0083U5DTC"><em>Pitch Perfect</em></a> by Erica Sadun and Steve Sande), but it was pretty short, gave the basic value proposition pretty quickly, and provided the key information that journalists like. It also included the press kit, a folder full of screenshots, the app icon at various sizes, and a press release.</p>
<h4>Video or No?</h4>
<p>A lot of great apps launch with an amazing launch video. It’s a great idea if you can afford to hire a video producer or can shoot it yourself well… like, really well. But whether you make a video for the public or not, <em>definitely</em> make a short one for the press. Journalists would rather spend 30 seconds watching your app in action than spend a few minutes trying to “get it” for themselves on their phones.</p>
<p>In our case, we didn’t have time to shoot a professional video, so we just made a <a href="http://vimeo.com/51481324">short video</a> for the press, showing off all of the features. It was pretty rough, but it did the job.</p>
<h3>Go Time</h3>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/launching-day-large-view_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/launching-day_500_mini.jpg" alt="Launching day" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137811" /></a></p>
<p>“Sorry, can’t talk right now. I’m super-busy launching Languages.&#8221; That was typical launch-day conversation. You would think that launching an app is a pretty good excuse to do nothing. It’s not. While I might have responded to some urgent questions from journalists or taken an emergency call with Apple here and there, this was really a day to kick back and watch all of our hard work pay off.</p>
<p>The majority of the day consisted of one activity: refreshing. Refreshing Twitter search for “Languages app” to see who was talking about it. Refreshing my “mentions” feed to see who was saying “Congrats!” Refreshing Google’s “past hour” search results for “languages” to uncover any new reviews.</p>
<p>Most of all, launch day can be characterized quite accurately as one of desperate and incessant refreshing of the App Store to see where Languages stood in the infamous top charts. It is the ultimate stroke of the ego after a year of blood, sweat and tears. This, folks, is what dreams are made of.</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>Aside from a few blunders on my part from miscommunications about when journalists could start posting reviews, the launch went even better than I expected.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/journalist-reviews_500_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/journalist-reviews_500_mini.jpg" alt="Reviews" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137813" /></a></p>
<p>We got some amazing reviews from some of my favorite journalists.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ranky/id432237659?mt=8"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/journalist-references_500_mini.jpg" alt="Number 1 reference" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137814" /></a></p>
<p>We blasted the announcement to Sonico’s substantial mailing list, the Languages mailing list, our blog and social media channels, resulting in a lot of buzz on Twitter and a swift climb up the App Store’s charts. Before long, we reached the number one spot in the “Reference” category.</p>
<h4>Apple</h4>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/getting-featured-by-apple_500_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/getting-featured-by-apple_500_mini.jpg" alt="Getting featured by Apple." width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137815" /></a></p>
<p>Our relationship with Apple is one of my company’s greatest assets and one that took time to cultivate. Getting featured prominently by Apple is one of the best things that can happen to your app. It will usually get you far more downloads than any coverage from the press.</p>
<p>When people ask me how I’ve gotten all of my apps to be featured by Apple, I usually recommend a big marketing push during launch in order to get Apple’s attention. This time, though, we were fortunate enough to have piqued Apple’s interest a few months before Languages launched. We were fairly certain that Apple would feature us, but were pleasantly surprised to be featured as the “Editor’s Choice” in many countries and very prominently in the “New &#038; Noteworthy” section in others.</p>
<h3>Blast Off!</h3>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/blast-off_500_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/blast-off_500_mini.jpg" alt="Blast off" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137816" /></a></p>
<p>Concentrating all of our marketing on launch day really paid off. With over a dozen press reviews, thousands of tweets and retweets, a blast to our mailing lists, and an important feature from Apple, Languages blasted into the top-25 overall paid apps on launch day. The snowball effect kicked in, and by day two, Languages peaked at number 5 in the US.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/paying-off_500_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/paying-off_500_mini.jpg" alt="French App Store" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137817" /></a></p>
<p>Results from the other countries were staggering, with the app hitting the number one spot in France and a few other European countries. Over 70% of our sales came from outside the US. Suffice it to say, app localization, the App Store description, and the screenshots that showed most of the major European languages paid off.</p>
<p>Whew, what a ride! I could finally check off one of my life goals: beating all incarnations of Angry Birds in the charts, if only for a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Aftermath</h3>
<p>Languages managed to stay in the top 100 for a couple weeks, and then slowly but surely made its inevitable descent down, down, down into the App Store abyss. Fortunately, Languages found a pretty comfortable resting spot around number 30 (and then later number 50) in the “Reference” category’s top-100 list.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.appannie.com"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/aftermath_500_mini.jpg" alt="Aftermath" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137818" /></a></p>
<p>We were pretty happy with the few hundred downloads it was getting per day. It wasn’t going to make us millionaires, but most of the money you make from these kinds of hit-based apps will be from major launches &mdash; i.e. major updates, the iPad version, etc. &mdash; so, the decent consistent sales are a bonus.</p>
<h4>Support</h4>
<p>Support doesn’t just mean updating the app with new features. One of the most time-consuming parts of making a popular app is addressing all of the bugs, feature requests and comments you receive via email and Twitter every day. During launch week, we were getting hundreds of emails a day. No joke.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the comments were mainly positive, asking for new languages and features.</p>
<p>I tried to respond to a lot of the emails, but pretty soon we realized that support was a full-time job, so we shifted responsibility to one of Sonico’s support guys. That being said, we did look through the emails to find recurring bugs reports and feature requests so that we could address them in the next version.</p>
<p>I expected users to ask for things like voice support and conjugation, but it turns out the most popular feature request was to be able to customize the bookshelf and to hide dictionaries not being used. That blew my mind, but we made sure to include that in the next version.</p>
<p>The most negative feedback was from users who said that, while the interface was great, they couldn’t find certain words in the dictionary. We learned from the Apple Maps fiasco that the robustness of an app’s content can easily overshadow the beauty of the interface. While our content wasn’t perfect, it was pretty decent, so fortunately we didn’t reenact the Apple Maps disaster, but we did need to work on it going forward.</p>
<h4>Raising the Price</h4>
<p>We decided to go for the mass market at launch and set the app at $0.99. If you are trying to hit the top charts, the app needs to be an impulse buy.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/raising-price_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/raising-price_mini.jpg" alt="Raising the price." width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137820" /></a></p>
<p>Having gone with a launch-sale approach, we raised the price to $2.99 once the app fell out of the top 100. Raising the price when the app is falling out of the charts might seem counterintuitive, but you actually make more money that way. The only reason we ever set it at $0.99 was to get the app to the top charts and to keep it there as long as possible. Once it falls out of the charts, the people who will find it are not impulse shoppers; they will have to actively look for it and will be willing to pay a higher price for it. This has worked out well for us.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Wow, that was quite a journey. If you’ve scrolled to the end for a reader’s digest, you’re in luck. The big lessons to take away are these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, marketing matters! Start way before your app launches.</li>
<li>Do it yourself by making friends in the industry.</li>
<li>Build buzz through social media.</li>
<li>Concentrate the marketing in blasts.</li>
<li>Spend time getting your pitch right.</li>
</ol>
<p>The App Store is certainly not easy street. Building a hit app takes a ton of hard work, and there are never any guarantees. That being said, it sure is a fun ride, and there is still plenty of opportunity for those who are willing to work at it. So, get out there and build something great!</p>

<p>A website has a personality &mdash; it is a reflection of the person or organization behind it. When people visit your website, you want it to stand out from the crowd, to be memorable. You want people to come back and use your website or get in touch with you.</p>
<p>So, to distinguish itself from the unwashed masses, your website not only needs remarkable content, but also has to be innovative yet functional. Ask yourself, what would make life easier for your user? Simple search functionality may be needed, or perhaps the navigation menu could use some sprucing up. Nevertheless, the personality of the website needs to be consistent throughout. The following websites will whet your appetite for extreme creativity. Browse through and explore them for yourself.</p>
<h3>Creative Navigation Designs</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.toybox.co.nz">Toybox</a><br />
Navigation should always be there when needed, and graciously disappear when the user wants to focus on a particular task. For example, in designing the checkout for an online store, the navigation should always be accessible but also give enough prominence to criticial features of the website, such as the checkout form. The navigation for Toybox does just that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.toybox.co.nz/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Toybox1_mini.png" alt="Toybox" title="Toybox" width="600" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p>It feels like you’re peeking behind the page or the lid of a toybox to see what’s inside. The navigation is easy to use, and the swivel effect directs the user’s attention to the navigation bar when they’re using it. Hiding the navigation also allows for a simple, clean design that makes viewing the projects quite pleasant, because the projects are not competing for attention.</p>
<p>Information you might want to know, such as what Toybox does and where it is located, can still be found in a discreet navigation bar at the top. The hover effect is also fun, as the other images get pushed back and fade as the user focuses on one project.</p>
<p><a href="http://olivierbossel.com/">Olivier Bossel</a><br />
The portfolio of Olivier Bossel, an interactive designer, is interesting. The navigation elements create an effect of exploding pixels as you hover over them. The effect is quite dynamic and contrasts with the otherwise clean design. It works nicely as a visual element because it encourages the user to continue through the website. The consistent visual voice and tone complement the brand’s identity. Just by viewing the website, the user experiences the designer’s work.</p>
<p><a href="http://olivierbossel.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Olivier-Bossel-1_mini.png" alt="Olivier Bossel" title="Olivier Bossel" width="600" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tsto.org/work/shapeshift/">Tsto</a><br />
Tsto, a design agency, has a simple yet unorthodox approach to design; its navigation is different from what we’d expect. A navigation element is fixed in each corner of the screen, framing the work being showcased. The visual identity is created with heavy hot-pink letters, along with the descriptive information. The hierarchy is clear, however, with the “Work” tab in the top-left corner, and the “Contact” and “About” tabs at the bottom of the page. In keeping with the style, the title of the work being showcased is in the same heavy pink font.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tsto.org/#shapeshift"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Tsto1_mini.png" alt="Tsto" title="Tsto" width="600" height="331" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p>When clicking through the work, which presents like a slideshow, a preview of the next project is shown when you hover over the arrow. The images are large and take up most of the page. As the user clicks through and views the large images, they get a clear idea of Tsto’s identity and work.</p>
<p><a href="http://derekboateng.com/">Derek Boateng</a><br />
Derek Boateng’s portfolio welcomes the user with a polite “Hi” upon loading, and an arrow directs you to scroll down. The general design is understated; it doesn’t shout at you, but rather gently guides you through the work. As you scroll down from the loading page, the header and navigation shrink back, allowing more space for the portfolio. This is a good example of navigation that is always accessible yet gives center stage to the main content.</p>
<p><a href="http://derekboateng.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Derek-Boateng_mini.png" alt="Derek Boateng" title="Derek Boateng" width="600" height="403" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.secondstory.com/">Second Story</a><br />
Ah, good ol’ horizontal scrolling! Second Story’s website works like a magazine app on a tablet. It is innovative in that it doesn’t have the feel of a typical Web page and it scrolls horizontally. The content is laid out in columns, and each section scrolls vertically. The navigation is anchored to the left, which helps to establish the rhythm. As you view this portfolio, the navigation minimizes to a bar on the left and reappears when hovered over. You can choose to view the portfolio in thumbnail view or as a slideshow.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.secondstory.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Second-Story_mini.png" alt="Second Story Interactive Studios" title="Second Story Interactive Studios" width="600" height="266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://mostlyserious.io/">Mostly Serious</a><br />
As its name suggests, Mostly Serious has an element of playfulness to it. You are greeted by navigation that is designed as balloons floating around. The friendly animation creates movement on the otherwise static website and sets the tone for the brand. While you can come back to the home page at any stage, a subtle navigation bar appears at the bottom of the page. The website is functional, with a splash of the studio’s fun personality. Actually, it reminds me of funky Flash animations from the good old days (<a href="http://www.eye4u.com/home/">EYE4U</a>, anyone?), but because the website is supposed to be a little playful, it works well in this context.</p>
<p><a href="http://mostlyserious.io/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Mostly-Serious_mini.png" alt="Mostly Serious" title="Mostly Serious" width="600" height="571" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://minimalmonkey.com/">Minimal Monkey</a><br />
Scrolling through articles in this bold simple design reminds me of browsing a bookshelf. The hover effect singles out an article for the user to focus on. This website also has a clever design for the “About” and “Contact” sections: When you click on a tab, the page drops down to reveal the information. It’s a simple way to provide information without redirecting to another page.</p>
<p><a href="http://minimalmonkey.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Minimal-Monkey_mini.png" alt="Minimal Monkey" title="Minimal Monkey" width="600" height="249" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p>However, viewing old articles is not so easy because there is no search functionality. If the user is looking for a particular article, they would have to scroll through to find it. Search functionality would be useful without changing the overall design too much.</p>
<p><a href="https://layervault.com/">LayerVault</a><br />
It’s amazing what effect a simple, clean layout with playful colors and fun animations can have. LayerVault balances white space and subtle animation to intrigue and engage the user. Animation can be used to illustrate a point, to guide the user through a website, or even to illustrate how-tos. Animation doesn’t always do the trick, but LayerVault applies it sparingly, and only when the user is browsing a particular section of the page. The result? A well laid out page with engaging and attractive illustrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://layervault.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/LayerVault_mini.png" alt="LayerVault" title="LayerVault" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://escapeflight.com/">Escape Flight</a><br />
Escape Flight is cleverly designed, and the logo animation as a page is loading is novel and funky. The navigation is fixed at the top and looks like a departures and arrivals board, as though you’re at the airport already! The drop-down menus look like a travel checklist, which works well with the theme. When you click on a location and scroll down, all of the important information remains fixed at the top, making access to the content much easier and more comfortable for the intrepid traveler.</p>
<p><a href="http://escapeflight.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Escapeflight_mini.png" alt="Escape Fligh" title="Escape Fligh" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p>Making use of stunning photography, Escape Flight maximizes its space. It’s exactly what you want from a travel website. It gives you a little taste of the adventure that awaits, beautifully showcasing the amazing destinations. When you hover over a destination, you find exactly what you need to know: ticket prices, weather conditions, flight time and travel length. What more could you ask for?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asciiarena.com/">aSCIIaRENa</a><br />
Calling all ASCII enthusiasts! aSCIIaRENa reeks of the ’90s. People can register and post news on the wall, submit their own text art, and get featured on the wall of fame.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asciiarena.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Asciiarena_mini.png" alt="Asciiarena" title="Asciiarena" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thesartorialist.com/category/men/">The Sartorialst</a><br />
Photographs are the focus on this website, and the design supports that with no muss or fuss. More importantly, the website uses the hover effect quite elegantly; captions slide in from the side and slide out again, following the cursor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thesartorialist.com/category/men/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/The-Satorialist_mini.png" alt="The Satorialst" title="The Satorialst" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://silktricky.com/#/home">SilkTricky</a><br />
The people behind SilkTricky are out to break the status quo, and their website doesn’t let down. Mousing over the images creates an interesting effect. The movement on the page creates a sense of activity that intrigues the user. On this single-page website, the user doesn’t have to click from page to page to navigate. Just click “View,” and the chosen article folds out as the other articles shift off. This would be a nice way to showcase a photography portfolio, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://silktricky.com/#/home"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Silk-Tricky_mini.png" alt="SilkTricky" title="SilkTricky" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sumall.com/">SumAll</a><br />
SumAll’s layout is clean, with no unnecessary extras that would distract the user. Hovering reveals more information in a simple understated manner, and the transitions are an extension of the hover effect. When you click on a button, succinct information and options appear below. I quite like that you aren’t redirected to another page when you click an option; rather, the information tidily appears below the button. A drawback: the navigation isn&#8217;t responsive, looking broken and inaccessible on smaller views.</p>
<p><a href="https://sumall.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SumAll_mini.png" alt="SumAll" title="SumAll" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.potluck.it/">Potluck</a><br />
Sorry for being so enthusiastic about this one, but Potluck exhibits a fantastic user experience. The generous white space helps the user access what they need, when they need it. The forms and buttons have a fresh and open aesthetic that makes them easy to spot and use. Both the text and beautiful graphics are laid out in a way that guides the user through the website. The buttons and icons work well together, and all buttons and input areas feel consistent and engaging. This is a great example of how a bit of well-chosen typography and a subtle, clean user interface go a long way to engaging and delighting users.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.potluck.it/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Potluck_mini.png" alt="Potluck" title="Potluck" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://lowdi.com/">Lowdi</a><br />
The single-page responsive layout works quite beautifully. Lowdi uses lines and shapes to set off sections of the page, a great way to break away from the conventional boxy layout. I love how the “Order now” button is incorporated in the design with line and shape. These elements adjust to your screen effectively, and the design maintains a flow throughout, which makes for easy viewing.</p>
<p><a href="https://lowdi.com/?z=UK"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lowdi_mini.png" alt="Lowdi" title="Lowdi" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://barcampomaha.org/">Barcamp Omaha</a><br />
Barcamp Omaha is an online invitation to an event. The single-page tool effectively guides the user through the narrative with a consistent visual theme. All of the essential what, where and when information is at the top of the page, but the design urges the user to scroll down to see what else they can find. I really like the clever integration of the Twitter and Facebook icons.</p>
<p><a href="http://barcampomaha.org/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Barcamp-Omaha_mini.png" alt="Barcamp Omaha" title="Barcamp Omaha" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p>As the user scrolls down, more information is provided systematically, and the layout remains tidy and succinct, with bold headings. The categories of conference talks are illustrated with simple animation to keep the user engaged. Once you’ve scrolled down the building and reached the ground, contact information is waiting for you, easily accessible.</p>
<p><a href="http://combadi.com/">Combadi</a><br />
This website feels tranquil as soon as it loads, a result of the careful design. While it does not have a lot of white space, it does not feel claustrophobic. Tabs expand on hover, providing more information and enhancing usability. Along with the other elements, this effect conveys an airy, calm feeling. The design mirrors the vocabulary of the website, and the various elements work together to achieve a coherent and consistent identity.</p>
<p><a href="http://combadi.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Comabdi_mini.png" alt="Combadi" title="Combadi" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://wallercreek.org/finalfour/">Waller Creek Conservancy: The Final Four</a><br />
A hover effect should not only provide more information, but also contribute to the visual appeal of the website. This website does that quite beautifully by expanding the image as you hover over it. The image also changes from greyscale to full color, with a caption. The effect is quite captivating.</p>
<p><a href="http://wallercreek.org/finalfour/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Wallcreek_mini.png" alt="The Waller Creek Conversy Design Comepetition" title="The Waller Creek Conversy Design Comepetition" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.liftinteractive.com/">Lift</a><br />
When laying out products or items on a website, it’s easy to end up with a static catalogue-style view. Lift’s simple hover effect rotates the books to display a 3-D version. This seemingly minor and simple visual effect really makes the website more interesting. The user feels that they are involved and can interact with the website. You can <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/01/08/3d-book-showcase/">achieve this 3-D effect</a>, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.liftinteractive.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lift_mini.png" alt="Lift" title="Lift" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.snowbird.com/">Snowbird</a><br />
Snowbird is a dynamic website that involves the user. The current weather is displayed and, when you hover over it, folds out to reveal the week’s forecast. The hover effect on the “Full Report” button, as it transforms rounded corners into square corners, is subtle yet effective. The teasers are triangular and look like a snowbird’s wing; when hovered over, they unfold into a square for a larger view.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.snowbird.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Snowbird_mini.png" alt="Snowbird" title="Snowbird" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://etchapps.com/">Etch</a><br />
The square sections on this website are tightly laid out but don’t feel cramped. The navigation in the top-left corner takes up little space because icons are used for the various categories. You can toggle the navigation to show and hide in the large view by clicking the menu icon. The responsive design makes the website easily accessible on any device, without losing functionality or brand appeal.</p>
<p><a href="http://etchapps.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Etch_mini.png" alt="Etch" title="Etch" width="600" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141757" /></a></p>

<p>If you’ve spent the last few months under a rock, then we&#8217;ve got a surprise for you. We are working on two brand new Smashing Books. The first, <a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-4.html?pk_campaign=front-page-shop&#038;pk_kwd=sb4-virtual-product"><em>New Perspectives on Coding</em></a>, will cover <strong>state-of-the-art techniques</strong>, case studies and coding strategies &mdash; all neatly packed into a gorgeous printed hardcover (and available as an eBook, of course).</p>
<p>So if you’ve always wanted to leave a trace of yourself to posterity, now you can (well, kind of). From the very first Smashing Book, we’ve reserved space to feature our readers in the book, and our fourth undertaking will be no exception.</p>
<h3>Add Your Twitter Avatar To The Book!</h3>
<p>A picture says more than a thousand words, and a Twitter avatar says more about one’s personality than a name ever could! So, following our tradition, we welcome you to submit your Twitter avatar for a double-page spread in the (printed and digital) book. Space is very limited, with only <strong>750</strong> slots available, so <strong>please be quick!</strong></p>
<h4>How Does It Work? Easy!</h4>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.smashed.by/jedi">Type in your Twitter username</a>, and &mdash; <em>voilà</em> &mdash; your spot it reserved!</li>
<li>We&#8217;ll grab your avatar automatically and will notify you about the status of the submission via email.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1.5em;"><a href="http://www.smashed.by/jedi"><img title="Submit Your Avatar Into The Book!" alt="Submit Your Avatar Into The Book!" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/submit-your-avatar-new.jpg" width="500" height="246" /></a></p>
<p>Presto! And if for some mysterious reason, you happen to feel like a Jedi afterwards, well, why not tweet about it using the hash tag <code>#feellikejedi</code>? No pressure: just sayin’!</p>
<h3>What Is The Book About?</h3>
<p>We’ve assembled a remarkable lineup of authors for the book. All of them are well-respected designers and developers who will be divulging practical insights, design strategies and hands-on tools as they share new perspectives on Web design today. Here is a quick summary of the book’s theme and table of contents.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p><a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-4.html?pk_campaign=front-page-shop&#038;pk_kwd=sb4-virtual-product"><img style="padding: 0 0 0.5em 0.75em; margin-top: 0; float: right; width: 275px !important;" alt="Smashing Book #4: Coding" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sb4-coding-small-preview.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>What works in theory sometimes doesn’t quite work as expected in practice. In this pragmatic book, well-respected designers and developers analyze their personal experiences, failures and successes from working on common front-end issues, and share the tools they use to tackle these issues effectively. You&#8217;ll learn <strong>state-of-the-art techniques</strong> and strategies to make your workflow more effective.</p>
<p>The book will feature valuable insights into large-scale projects, front-end architecture, maintainable code and responsible responsive Web design. It will also uncover smart <strong>front-end</strong> strategies, CSS and JavaScript tricks and obscure back-end techniques, and it will explore what it takes to improve performance for faster and more robust websites and Web apps.</p>

<p>Whether it’s on desktop or mobile, users want their web experience to be <strong>snappy, smooth and delightful</strong>. What this means is that even if the browser is busy rendering the page (i.e drawing it) or loading in content, the user should still be able to scroll around and interact with it without any slow-down. No one likes seeing visual glitchyness.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Addy Osmani, the mastermind behind Yeoman and Devtools, provides a walkthrough on how to find and fix visual jitter in your pages. If you care about providing fast and smooth experiences, you will care about this chapter, too.</p>

Are you keeping up? We’ve outgrown the methods of yesteryear and it’s now up to us to update the unwritten rules of web development to fit the new landscape. This chapter explores some misconceptions about CSS, encourages a change in attitude in front-end development, explores practical approaches of and lessons learned in object-oriented CSS development, code structure, code management, naming conventions and verbosity of HTML.</p>
<p>You’ll explore a new frame of mind that is better equipped for building more powerful, pragmatic front-ends.</p>

What if you need to make changes? What if you didn’t anticipate the additional features that would be required? What if the project ends up going in a different direction? Can your code adapt?</p>
<p>We are rarely taught how to deal with messy code. However, someone is going to have to maintain that code. That someone might be you next month or it might be someone else next year, but someone eventually will need to maintain that code. On a large project with many developers, the problem is magnified. How can everyone work in the same code base in such a way that making changes in the future are easy? That’s what this chapter is about.</p>

The impact of improved web performance is no minor detail: by caring <em>a lot</em> about how fast our websites and applications are, we can explore new markets, gain increased revenue, improved business metrics and better user satisfaction. But how do we bake performance into the design process? We must make performance part of the discussion from the very beginning of the process, and we must be concrete about it.</p>

You’ve just finished developing a brand new website and last night you were proudly clicking through the product list. The browser window is still open, the Widget 3000 is still sparkling in its AJAXy newness. You grin like a new parent and expectantly click on “more details.” And nothing happens. You click again, still nothing. You press &#8220;Refresh&#8221; and get that annoying swirling icon and then the page goes blank. Help! The Internet is gone!</p>
<p>This chapter starts with the worst case scenario and works inwards, exploring the infrastructure of the Internet and the make-up of a Web server, imparting lots of little tips and commands along the way, opening up a new perspective on how websites can stop working and be fixed.</p>

Smartly built interfaces offer a <strong>continuum</strong> of experience. So what if we architect our interfaces to adapt to the capabilities of our user’s devices in order to ensure a positive experience, even if it’s not an identical one?</p>
<p>In this chapter, Aaron explores the layers of a typical Web experience and breaks down the development process into manageable steps that enable accessible, functional and empathetic interfaces. He also describes his own process and various techniques that help him to achieve this very goal in daily routine. </p>

The most common death knell we’ve heard ringing out—lately, anyway—is that every page of a responsive site is fated to weigh in at a couple dozen megabytes and there isn’t a single thing that any of us can do about it.</p>
<p>There are good solution though. We can’t blame responsive Web design for mistakes that we, developers, have been making. This is on us, and you don’t see any carpenters writing blog posts about how hammers are a failed methodology because of the time they dropped one on their foot. We can do better than blaming our tools for our mistakes. This chapter is about exactly that: tools, techniques, lessons learned and practical tips to manage responsible responsive designs in real-life projects.</p>

There, the larger part of our time is consumed looking at spinning animations telling us something is loading and many a time we are being told that “the connection is wonky” and that we should try again.</p>
<p>That’s a sign of the Web being broken. It’s time to fix it. Let’s try to take a break in our drive to be cool and new and innovative the whole time and check out what we are doing &mdash; analyze our eating habits so to say. Christian Heilmann calls this the “Vanilla Web Diet,” much like people start calling using JavaScript without any libraries “Vanilla JavaScript.” This chapter explores some of the fundamental ideas and thoughts that you can apply to slim down your next app or existing solution. </p>

<p>High-definition (or “Retina”) displays have spread wider and wider, and evidently their numbers will keep growing. So, as creators of products that will be consumed on Retina devices, we have to optimize our design and development workflow accordingly.</p>
<p>Slicing graphics from finished designs to use for development is one of the less enjoyable parts of building a website or app. And it takes a long time. Because slicing is a monotonous and straightforward task, using the right tool and workflow <strong>can save you hours or even days of work</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/retinize-it-action_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/retinize-it-action_mini.png" alt="retinize-it-action" width="500" height="354" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-162055" /></a></p>
<p>Preparing graphics for development mostly entails saving user-interface elements from the final mockups, with transparent backgrounds. And to support Retina displays, we also need to create double-sized versions of elements.</p>
<p>Upon failing to find a tool that fits my design team’s workflow, <strong>I created a set of two time-saving Photoshop actions</strong> for slicing graphics for Retina and standard displays. The great feedback from my team inspired me to share it with other designers. The tool has gotten good buzz in the Web design and front-end development community, so today I’m happy to introduce <a href="http://retinize.it">Retinize It</a> on Smashing Magazine.</p>
<p><a href="http://retinize.it/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/retinize-it-website_mini.jpg" alt="Retinize It website" width="500" height="482" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-162057" /></a><br />
<em>Retinize It uses Photoshop actions and <a href="http://retinajs.com">retina.js</a> to optimize for Retina displays.</em></p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Select one layer, several layers or a group of layers, and run the action. Once you’ve activated it, you just need to name the files and set the directory to save them to.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/steps1_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/steps2_mini.jpg" alt="Retinize It" width="500" height="556" /></a></p>
<p>In the background, Retinize It copies the selected layers to a new file, makes the background transparent and trims the space around the element. Once that’s done, the action asks what you want to name the file, saves it, scales the original element by 200%, and saves that as a separate file. After this process, you’ll be returned to the original file.</p>
<h4>How Much Of The Slicing Process The Action Saves</h4>
<p>Almost all of it. The only thing you have to do is choose the directory and name the files. Remember to add a high-resolution modifier, <code>@2x</code>, for the Retina versions of the files. This convention was <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/2DDrawing/Conceptual/DrawingPrintingiOS/SupportingHiResScreensInViews/SupportingHiResScreensInViews.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010156-CH15-SW1">established</a> in Apple’s iOS Developer Library.</p>
<p>If you’re building an iOS application, then you’ll need to provide a background and splash screen in three resolutions: standard (320 &#215; 480 pixels), Retina (640 &#215; 960 pixels) and iPhone 5 (1136 &#215; 640 pixels). The naming convention for the standard and Retina versions is straightforward. For images for the iPhone 5’s screen resolution, Apple recommends adding a <code>-568h@2x</code> suffix, although Apple doesn’t require it.</p>
<p>Apparently, this happens because Xcode does not automatically associate <code>-568h@2x</code> images with the iPhone 5’s resolution; developers may set the suffix manually for this kind of file. I’ve worked with an iOS developer who has asked Apple to add a <code>@5x</code> suffix. So, the best way to determine the naming convention for iPhone 5 images in future is to ask your developer. In other cases, use the <code>-568h@2x</code> suffix.</p>
<p>The techniques presented in the article “<a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/20/towards-retina-web/">Towards A Retina Web</a>” bring the <code>@2x</code> convention from mobile apps to the Web, helping us to optimize websites for Retina displays very quickly.</p>
<h4>Why Scale by 200% and Not 50%?</h4>
<p>Retinize It is <strong>good for those who start designing at non-Retina sizes</strong>, which is a better practice for two reasons. First, the non-Retina version of an image will look much closer to the final product, giving you more accurate feedback on how the design will actually look.</p>
<p>Secondly, an element with an odd size value that is scaled by 50% will end up with a x.5 pixel value, making the element blurry. Bjango explains this issue in his article “<a href="http://bjango.com/articles/designingforretina2/">Designing for Retina Display</a>,” as does Niklaus Gerber in his article “<a href="http://niklausgerber.com/blog/designing-for-iphone4/">Designing for the iPhone 4</a>.”</p>
<h4>What Kind of Layers Will This Work With?</h4>
<p>The non-Retina action in this pack will work with any kind of layer. If you’re using the Retina version, then you should work with shapes and smart objects, so that the 200%-scaled file will not look pixelated.</p>
<p>Also, if your layer has an inner or drop shadow, then uncheck “Use Global Light”; otherwise, those effects in the sliced version of the layer will inherit Photoshop’s default angle.</p>
<h3>What Does The Set Include?</h3>
<p>The set includes two Photoshop actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slice It</strong><br />
This action slices a 100%-sized version of an element.</li>
<li><strong>Retinize It</strong><br />
This action saves a 100%-sized version and a 200%-scaled version.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Makes It Special?</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s free to use.</li>
<li>Install in one click.</li>
<li>You don’t need to change the layer structure in PSD files.</li>
<li>You don’t need to name layers.</li>
<li>It’s optimized for Retina displays.</li>
<li>Run in one click, no setup needed.</li>
<li>Windows and Mac support.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Download And Documentation</h3>

<h3>Additional Tools</h3>
<h4>PNG EXPRESS (MAC &#038; Windows, $29)</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.pngexpress.com"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/png-express_mini.jpg" alt="png-express" width="500" height="301" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-163988" /></a><br />
<em>A specification created by PNG Express</em></p>
<p>If you will be having limited interaction with the developer who will be coding your design and you’re not sure it will be pixel-perfect, <a href="http://www.pngexpress.com">PNG Express</a> can be a great time-saver. It helps you to create specifications with instructions on element positions, margins, fonts and font sizes.</p>
<p>PNG Express also has an option for slicing images including Retina support.</p>
<h4>ImageOptim (Mac Only, Free)</h4>
<p><a href="http://imageoptim.com"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/imageoptim_mini.jpg" alt="imageoptim" width="652" height="426" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-163990" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://imageoptim.com">ImageOptim</a> reduces image sizes while maintaining quality. The tool removes internal data embedded by graphics editors, such as comments and color profiles. I recommend adding an images folder from your website to this app before compiling and going live. ImageOptim will reduce around 30% of an image’s size on average.</p>
<h4>Slicy (Mac Only, $29)</h4>
<p><a href="http://macrabbit.com/slicy/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/slicy_mini.jpg" alt="slicy_mini" width="500" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165811" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://macrabbit.com/slicy/">Slicy</a> is great-designed tool most designers and developers are using for slicing graphics for iOS apps. The tool exports graphics from PSDs automatically, but it requires to organize your layers in Photoshop and name them in certain way. In addition once you make changes in Photoshop, Slicy updates the slices automatically. The main reason I decided not to use Slicy is no ability for quick export for couple of elements from PSD without preparing it for Slicy.</p>

<p>If you code websites, it’s a good bet that at least one of your clients has asked about or requested a mobile-friendly website. If you go the responsive design route (whereby your website is flexible enough to adjust visually from mobile to desktop widths), then you’ll need a strategy to make images flexible, too &mdash; a responsive image solution.</p>
<p>The basics are fairly simple to learn, but once you’ve mastered them, you’ll find that scaling images is only the beginning &mdash; you might also have performance and art direction conundrums to solve. You’ll be faced with a wide field of responsive image solutions to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses &#8212; and none of them is perfect! This article leads you through the basics, and then arms you with the information you’ll need to <strong>pick the best responsive image solution for your situation</strong>.</p>
<h3>The Basics</h3>
<p>Styling foreground images to adjust to the width of their container is very easy. In your style sheet, perhaps in your normalize or reset style sheet, you’d add the following code:</p>
<pre class="language-css">
<code class="language-css">img {
    max-width: 100%;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>In most cases, that tiny style rule will do the trick! Once it’s in place, if the container around the image becomes narrower than the width of the image, then the image will scale down to match the width of its container. Setting the <code>max-width</code> to <code>100%</code> also <strong>ensures that the image does not scale larger than its actual size</strong>, which would significantly reduce the image’s quality. If you’re still stuck providing support for IE 6 or 7, you’ll want to add a <code>width: 100%</code> style rule targeted only to those browsers, because they don’t understand <code>max-width</code>.</p>
<p>High-resolution “Retina” images can make this basic implementation a bit tricky. Let’s say you want your 150 &#215; 150-pixel logo to display at double the usual pixel density, and the image is small enough that having two separate versions wouldn’t be a problem. So, you create a 300 &#215; 300-pixel version of the logo and plug it in &mdash; and now it’s huge! Your first inclination is probably to try something like this in CSS:</p>
<pre class="language-css">
<code class="language-css">img.sitelogo {
    max-width: 150px;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn’t work as expected &mdash; the logo image will now refuse to scale nicely with the other images on the page.</p>
<p>To limit the maximum width of an adaptive image, you’d have to <strong>limit the maximum width of the image’s container</strong>, rather than of the image itself! Let’s say you’ve wrapped your logo image in a module with a class of <code>branding</code>. Here is the style that will do the trick:</p>
<pre class="language-css">
<code class="language-css">.branding {
    max-width: 150px;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>So, now we have scalable responsive images in our website’s fluid layout. Mission accomplished. Time to go find out what this strange “outdoors” place has to offer to a sun-starved developer, right? </p>
<p>Not so fast! We still have two main challenges to overcome.</p>
<h3>The Performance Problem</h3>
<p>With the responsive image solution outlined above, all devices are fed the same images. Small icons and logos might not be too bad, but the problem compounds quickly as the images get larger and heftier. Retina images exacerbate the problem &mdash; you don’t want to send a big Retina image to a device that isn’t capable of displaying its full detail!</p>
<p>Think about it. Should we really be sending a 990 &#215; 300-pixel 100 KB image meant for desktop viewers to a mobile phone? Sure, the mobile visitor might be on their local coffee shop’s Wi-Fi connection &mdash; however, they might be on the road trying to get crucial information from your website, with one shaky bar of wireless service. Every mobile user who gives up when your page takes too long to load is a potential customer lost!</p>
<p>Many mobile websites that are just as big or bigger than their desktop counterparts can be found in the wild today. <a href="http://twitter.com/guypod">Guy Podjarny</a> ran some tests a year apart, and there hasn’t been much improvement: <a href="http://www.guypo.com/mobile/performance-implications-of-responsive-design-book-contribution/">in 2011</a>, 86% of websites were the same size or larger, and <a href="http://www.guypo.com/uncategorized/real-world-rwd-performance-take-2/">in 2012</a> that number went down to 72%, but the overall sizes of websites increased. Dave Rupert also captured the problem beautifully in his article “<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/mo-pixels-mo-problems">Mo’ Pixels Mo’ Problems</a>.”</p>
<h4>Complicating It Further: Browser Preloading</h4>
<p>When I first began wrestling with performance issues on responsive websites, my initial thought was to put all of the image variations on the page, and set up some CSS classes with media queries that would hide big images and show small images at small widths, and vice versa at desktop widths. It seemed logical: shouldn’t the browser only download the visible images?</p>
<p>The problem is that browsers are too quick for us! In order to provide the fastest loading time possible, <strong>browsers preload all of the images that they can identify</strong> in the source code before any CSS or JavaScript is processed. So, this approach would actually penalize mobile visitors <em>more</em>, by forcing them to download <em>all</em> of an image’s variants!</p>
<p>Because of this preloading, most solutions require either a back-end solution (to preempt the preloading) or special markup and JavaScript.</p>
<h4>Bandwidth Detection</h4>
<p>The last piece of the performance puzzle is network speed. We know that we want to feed only the large images to devices that are on a speedy network, but how do we determine that? A few techniques are out there to estimate network speed, but they aren’t foolproof yet.</p>
<p>The W3C has been working on a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/netinfo-api/">Network Information API</a>, which could be very helpful in future, but currently it’s supported by only a handful of devices (and not the big ones, unfortunately). It is currently implemented in a few responsive image solutions, but I don’t expect it to be widely adopted until it’s more widely supported. <a href="http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/09/bandwidth-media-queries-we-dont-need-em/">Network measurements are difficult</a> and as Yoav Weiss states in his Smashing Magazine&#8217;s article, reliable &#8220;bandwidth media queries&#8221; don’t seem to be something that can be accurately implemented in the near future.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/adamdbradley/foresight.js">Foresight.js</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/adamdbradley">Adam Bradley</a> uses JavaScript to test how long the browser takes to download a 50K image, then stores that information and uses it to make bandwidth decisions. It does have a few small drawbacks: it does add a 50K image download to your page, and it can block download of other images on your page until the test image download is complete.  Many of the responsive image solutions that currently implement bandwidth detection use a variation or adaptation of Foresight.js.</p>
<h3>The “Art Direction” Problem</h3>
<p>Let’s say you’ve got a beautiful wide image on your home page. It shows a wide bucolic expanse of fields and forest, blue sky and fluffy clouds above, and a happy family having a picnic on the grass.</p>
<p>Now scale it down to 300 pixels wide, mobile-style. At this scale, our vacationing family looks more like the ants at the picnic!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tingy/32067554/in/photostream/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/picnic_without_art_direction_mini.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="544" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136841" /></a><br />
<em>Detail is lost when this large image is scaled down. (Image: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tingy/32067554/in/photostream/">Mark McQuitty</a>)</em></p>
<p>Herein lies what we call the “art direction” problem. Some images just don’t scale well; fine detail is lost, and dramatic impact is reduced. In the case of our hero image, it would be much nicer visually if the mobile version of the photo was zoomed in, cropped and focused on our happy family. To solve this problem, we need a responsive image solution that enables you either to specify different versions of the image for different situations or to adjust the image on the fly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tingy/32407984/in/photostream/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/picnic_with_art_direction_mini.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="544" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136840" /></a><br />
<em>Sometimes a different crop or zoom of the image is desirable for narrow widths. (Images: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tingy/32407984/in/photostream/">Mark McQuitty</a>)</em></p>
<h3>Choosing Your Solution</h3>
<p>Luckily, the web development and design community has no shortage of creative, smart people who have been working to solve these problems. Of course, the flip side of that coin is that it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of responsive image solutions out there. How do you decide which is best for you?</p>
<p>Choosing between them can be an extremely complicated matter, because so many factors come into play. No current solution is perfect for every situation; each was <strong>designed to solve a particular set of problems</strong>. To decide, you’ll need to weigh each solution against your project’s particular needs. Chris Coyier has done a great job of <a href="http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use/">summarizing the deciding factors</a> (including a spreadsheet to track them all, although some newer solutions aren’t mentioned).</p>
<p>Here are some factors to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you need to solve the art direction problem (i.e. different image ratios, crops and sizes for different widths)?</li>
<li>Do you have a huge website or a CMS on which going back to add special markup to every image is not feasible?</li>
<li>Are all images present upon the page loading, or are some images loaded dynamically via JavaScript?</li>
<li>Do you want to test for the user’s bandwidth to determine whether their connection is fast enough to handle high-resolution images?</li>
<li>Does the solution require a platform that is unavailable to you (such as jQuery or PHP)?</li>
<li>Is a third-party solution acceptable, or do you need to keep the solution hosted in-house?</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, let’s look at some responsive image solutions that have been out there for a while and that are widely used within the developer community.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The list of solutions below is by no means comprehensive. They are the ones either that I’ve found most useful personally or that have proven track records for reliability. Have a favorite solution of your own that’s not here? Let us know in the comments!</p>
<h3>Tried And True Responsive Image Solutions</h3>
<h4>Picturefill</h4>
<p>The Web is truly worldwide, and we have to confront the fact that not everyone has access to fiberoptic connections and 4G networks. <a href="http://twitter.com/scottjehl">Scott Jehl</a> encountered this digital divide first-hand while travelling and working his way through Southeast Asia, and he is a strong advocate of mobile-first and responsive websites that don’t put an undue burden on mobile users. His <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill">Picturefill</a> script is a polyfill for the proposed <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element &mdash; JavaScript code that mimics the picture API, enabling us to use it on our websites today. The future is now, baby!</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/solution_picturefill_mini.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136845" /></p>
<p>Picturefill does not require jQuery, but obviously it does require the <code>picturefill.js</code> script to be included somewhere in the page. Picturefill also <strong>requires some special markup</strong>, with divs to represent the image variations, differentiated by <code>data-media</code> attributes that act just like media queries in CSS. You may also optionally put an image in conditional comments for browsers that don’t support media queries (I’m looking at you, IE 8), and a fallback in a <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag for browsers that don’t have JavaScript enabled (I’m looking at you, BlackBerry).</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a typical Picturefill setup:</p>
<pre class="language-markup">
<code class="language-markup">&lt;div data-picture data-alt="Descriptive alt tag"&gt;
    &lt;span data-src="images/myimage_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span data-src="images/myimage_lg.jpg" data-media="(min-width: 600px)">&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;!--[if (lt IE 10) &#038; (!IEMobile)]&gt;
    &lt;span data-src="images/myimage_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;![endif]--&gt;

    &lt;!-- Fallback content for non-JS browsers. --&gt;
    &lt;noscript&gt;
        &lt;img src="images/myimage_sm.jpg" alt="Descriptive alt tag" /&gt;
    &lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>That’s all you need to display adaptive images at page-loading time using Picturefill. Drop in the script, configure the markup, and everything just works. You can also call Picturefill programmatically if you need to add images to the page on the fly.</p>
<p>Picturefill requires a lot of custom markup, so it might not be the best choice for those who cannot alter their website’s source code for any reason. It also doesn’t do any bandwidth detection. If bandwidth detection is important to your project, then have a look at this next solution.</p>
<h4>HiSRC</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/teleject/hisrc">HiSRC</a>, by <a href="http://twitter.com/1marc">Marc Grabanski</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/teleject">Christopher Schmitt</a>, is a jQuery plugin that enables you to create low-, medium- and high-resolution versions of an image, and the script will show the appropriate one based on Retina-readiness and network speed.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/teleject/hisrc"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/solution_hisrc_mini.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136843" /></a></p>
<p>To set it up, first make sure that jQuery and the HiSRC script is included somewhere on the page.</p>
<p>In your HTML code, first add a regular image tag to the page, and set the source to be the low-resolution (or smallest) version of the image. Add a class to the image or its wrapper (like <code>.hisrc</code>) to specify which images HiSRC should process. Then, add some special markup to your image tag: <code>data-1x</code> and <code>data-2x</code> attributes, pointing to the medium- and high-resolution versions, respectively. For example:</p>
<pre class="language-markup">
<code class="language-markup">&lt;img src="http://placekitten.com/200/100" data-1x="http://placekitten.com/400/200" data-2x="http://placekitten.com/800/400" class="hisrc" /&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>Then, after the DOM has loaded, just call the function on the image class that you’re using, like so:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code class="language-javascript">$(document).ready(function(){
  $(".hisrc").hisrc();
});</code>
</pre>
<p>In practice, the browser will first load the image source &mdash; i.e. the mobile version of the image. Then, the script checks to see whether the visitor is using mobile bandwidth (such as 3G). If so, it leaves the mobile-first image in place. If the connection is speedy and the browser supports a Retina image, then the <code>@2x</code> version is delivered. If the connection is speedy but Retina is not supported, then the <code>@1x</code> version is delivered.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that the low-resolution image always loads, even if the script later decides that the user’s device is a good candidate for high resolution. Even though this is technically a double-download, it only penalizes those on speedy connections. I’m willing to accept that compromise!</p>
<p>HiSRC can handle images that are added to the page dynamically. It also allows for multiple images, so you can specify different crops and sizes to beat the art-direction problem.</p>
<p>As for weaknesses, HiSRC does require jQuery, so it won’t be useful unless you’re using that library. It also requires custom markup in the HTML, so it might not be the best choice if you have a huge website with a lot of legacy images or a CMS in which the output of the image tag can’t be altered. If that’s your situation, read on!</p>
<h4>Adaptive Images</h4>
<p>Unlike the previous two scripts, <a href="http://adaptive-images.com/">Adaptive Images</a>, by <a href="http://twitter.com/MattWilcox">Matt Wilcox</a>, is mostly a server-side solution. It requires a tiny bit of JavaScript, but the real work is done via the Apache 2 Web server, PHP 5.x and the GD library.</p>
<p>To install it on your Web server, you’ll need to alter or add an <code>.htaccess</code> file, upload some PHP files to your website’s root directory, add some JavaScript to your pages (which will add a cookie to record the user’s screen resolution), and configure some breakpoint variables in the PHP files to match your website’s media queries.</p>
<p><a href="http://adaptive-images.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/solution_adaptiveimages_mini.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136842" /></a></p>
<p>The installation instructions are quite verbose &mdash; a bit too lengthy for the scope of this article. For more information, visit the official website and click the “Details” link at the top.</p>
<p>The best feature of Adaptive Images is that it <strong>requires no custom markup on any of your images</strong>. Once you’ve installed and configured it correctly, you’re all set! The PHP script will intercept any request for an image and will resize it on the fly as needed to your specified breakpoint sizes and serve it on your pages automatically.</p>
<p>The PHP has a lot of configurable options, such as image quality, breakpoints, caching, and even a sharpening filter to apply to the generated scaled images.</p>
<p>It has a few limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because it requires the combination of Apache and PHP, Adaptive Images might not match up with your website’s platform or be available on your Web host’s server.</li>
<li>It relies on the Web server’s ability to intercept any requests for images (via the <code>.htaccess</code> file). So, if your images are hosted elsewhere, such as on a content delivery network, then it won’t work.</li>
<li>It doesn’t detect bandwidth.</li>
<li>It’s not meant to solve the art direction problem, because it only rescales the original images. It can’t crop or create different aspect ratios from the original image.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have noticed that all of the solutions thus far require JavaScript, and often some detailed configuration. If you’re looking for one that doesn’t require JavaScript and that is fairly simple to implement, then have a look at this next one.</p>
<h4>Sencha.io Src</h4>
<p>Previously known as TinySrc, <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/io/">Sencha.io Src</a> is a third-party solution that acts as a proxy for images, so you don’t need to configure anything on your server. Just point your image at Sencha’s servers (with or without some options specified), and Sencha will process it and send back a resized version as needed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/io/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/solution_senchaio_mini.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136847" /></a></p>
<p>Let’s say you have a big image:</p>
<pre class="language-markup">
<code class="language-markup">&lt;img src="http://www.your-domain.com/path/to/image.jpg" alt="My large image" /&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>At its simplest, you’d just prefix the <code>src</code> attribute with <code>http://src.sencha.io/</code>, like so:</p>
<pre class="language-markup">
<code class="language-markup">&lt;img src="http://src.sencha.io/http://www.your-domain.com/path/to/image.jpg" alt="My large image" /&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>By default, Sencha.io will resize your image to fit the width of the device’s screen, using the user-agent string for detection. Phones might be sent a 320-pixel-wide image, tablets a 768-pixel-wide image, etc.</p>
<p>You can also configure the Sencha.io prefix string to return particular measurements, orientations, percentage sizes or any number of complex calculations.</p>
<p>Sencha.io is a free service for individual users and can be a very convenient adaptive image solution. However, you’re adding a third-party dependency, with the possibility of downtime and problems beyond your control. Weigh these risks carefully.</p>
<h3>Responsive Image Solutions To Watch</h3>
<p>The solutions outlined till now are usable today, but they’re not the only fish in the sea. Some newer solutions show a lot of promise, and I’m keeping a sharp eye on them to see how they evolve with current Web technology. Below are two in particular that you might want to watch.</p>
<h4>Capturing/Mobify.js 2.0</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.mobify.com/mobifyjs/v2/docs/capturing/">Capturing</a> is a new feature of the in-development Mobify.js 2.0, which proposes to give you access to (or to “capture”) the HTML source markup <strong>before it is parsed or rendered by the browser</strong>. Accessing the source code at this stage enables you to swap an image’s <code>src</code> attribute before the browser downloads it.  You can even craft a fallback to one of the other solutions, such as Picturefill, in case something fails.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mobify.com/mobifyjs/v2/docs/capturing/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/solution_mobifyjs_mini.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136844" /></a></p>
<p>Since this technique directly circumvents native browser preloading, it is a bit controversial in web performance circles.  If misused, it could actually create performance problems on a site instead of alleviating them!</p>
<p>The other thing holding me back from running to this solution with open arms is its cross-browser support. Capturing won’t work in any version of IE lower than 10, so IE 8 and 9 users will be left out in the cold. I’ll keep watching, though &mdash; down the road a ways, when IE 8 and 9 finally fade into the sunset, this solution might be more viable!</p>
<p>If you’re interested in finding out more about Capturing, the Mozilla team goes into more detail in its blog post, “<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/03/capturing-improving-performance-of-the-adaptive-web/">Capturing: Improving Performance of the Adaptive Web</a>.”</p>
<h4>ReSRC.it</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.resrc.it/">ReSRC.it</a> is another third-party solution (currently in beta) that delivers responsive images from the cloud. It seems to be very similar in implementation to Sencha.io Src, but adds image filters and bandwidth detection and doesn’t rely on user-agent detection or cookies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.resrc.it/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/solution_resrcit_mini.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136846" /></a></p>
<p>To get started, you first need to sign up for a free beta account.</p>
<p>Then, suppose you have an image like this:</p>
<pre class="language-markup">
<code class="language-markup">&lt;img src="http://path/to/image.jpg" alt="My large image" /&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>You would prefix the image source’s URL with a path to one of ReSRC.it’s servers (it currently has two servers, one for the US and one for the UK):</p>
<pre class="language-markup">
<code class="language-markup">&lt;img src="http://app.resrc.it/http://www.your-domain.com/path/to/image.jpg" alt="My large image" /&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>ReSRC.it allows you to add parameters to the requested URL to perform operations on the image, such as rotating, cropping and flipping. This allows for quite a bit of flexibility and potentially addresses the art-direction problem. The parameters are processed in order from left to right and can be strung together.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of an image that’s being flipped horizontally, resized to 300-pixels wide, with the resulting image optimized to an 80%-quality JPEG:</p>
<pre class="language-markup">
<code class="language-markup">&lt;img src="http://app.resrc.it/F=H/s=w300/o=80/http://www.your-domain.com/path/to/image.jpg" alt="My large image" /&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>ReSRC.it can be a very flexible solution to the Art Direction problem;  however, since image sizes are controlled by URL parameters, ReSRC.it needs to be paired with something like Picturefill in order to create a fully responsive solution.</p>
<p>Because ReSRC.it is currently in beta, it may not be the best solution to try out on a big website. It looks like the vendor will be offering various account levels once it’s out of beta (free, pro and enterprise), so it’s not clear how much of the functionality will continue to be free once it launches. Although one never knows &mdash; sometimes, being an early adopter and beta tester has its rewards!</p>
<h3>Test, Test, Test!</h3>
<p>After you’ve chosen and implemented a responsive image solution, testing the performance of your website is absolutely necessary to making sure that the solution is working well. Below are a few useful online testing tools to help you.</p>
<h4>YSlow</h4>
<p>Created by Yahoo, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">YSlow</a> is a client-side tool that analyzes your website against 23 testable rules that Yahoo has determined can adversely affect Web page performance. YSlow awards your website a grade for each rule, explaining each one and suggesting how to improve your website’s performance. YSlow is available for Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera (as well as by a few other means, such as the command line).</p>
<h4>WebPageTest</h4>
<p>The online tool <a href="http://webpagetest.org">WebPageTest</a> is an open-source project maintained by Google. You enter your website’s URL, perform a speed test from a chosen location, and specify which browser to use. Advanced settings allow you to perform multi-step transactions, pick a network speed (cable, DSL, FiOS, etc.), disable JavaScript, block ads and make other requests, and more. The results come in the form of tables, charts, screenshots, a performance review and a lot of great data to dig into!</p>
<p>The Yottaa blog has an article detailing <a href="http://www.yottaa.com/blog/bid/261916/Test-Results-Performance-Benefits-of-Responsive-Image-Loading">how they used WebPageTest to test out their website both with and without responsive image loading</a> &#8212; check it out!</p>

<p>I’m writing this because <strong>I believe we learn much more from success than from failure</strong>. It took Edison thousands of failed attempts to invent the electric light bulb, and it would be foolish for us to reinvent it based on trial and error, now that we have a working model.</p>
<p>We have many shining lights in the app industry. While I would love to claim that my success stems from my own genius, nothing could be further from the truth. By studying independent developers who have succeeded in the App Store again and again, I was able to learn the basic principles that I needed to succeed, and I hope this story will help others do the same.</p>
<h3>A Big Idea</h3>
<p>My first app, Grades, had everything going for it. The press loved it, users loved it, and Apple loved it. There was only one problem: It didn’t make any money. Sure, it generated a little cash, but despite all of the buzz, Grades was always limited by the tiny niche it served: college students who cared enough about their grades to faithfully track them throughout the semester.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/preview4-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/preview4-small.jpg" alt="Our first app, Grades, was a success for our reputation but not for our bank account." width="500" height="333" class="size-large wp-image-136588" /></a><br />
<em>Our first app, Grades, was a success for our reputation, not for our bank account. <a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/preview4-large.jpg">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>If we were to continue making cheap apps, our next one had to be big. <strong>It had to appeal to almost anyone.</strong></p>
<p>The solution came when Alex Marktl, founder of Sonico Mobile, approached us about partnering on an offline translation app. It was a proven market. Sonico’s app iTranslate had over 30 million users, and the market had an immense gap for an affordable translation app that worked without an Internet connection.</p>
<p>After seeing some user feedback for Sonico’s popular iTranslate app and researching the competition, we were pretty sure the market opportunity was huge. In addition, my four-person team is really passionate about education and language. The market was there, the opportunity was there, and the passion was there &mdash; a perfect fit.</p>
<p>A few Skype calls later, we had hashed out agreements and were ready to roll.</p>
<p>(Spoiler: It turns out that ideas matter a lot. Languages attracted a similar amount of press and buzz as Grades, but it made more money in one day than Grades made in two years!)</p>
<h3>Defining The Dictionary</h3>
<p>Although I was tempted to jump right into wireframing, we did some research up front to help us define the problems we were trying to solve.</p>
<h4>Competitive Landscape</h4>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/competitors-large.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/competitors-small.png" alt="Competitors" width="500" height="329" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136608" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/competitors-large.png">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>The App Store is great because it is one of the few markets in the world where you can so easily find valuable information about your potential competitors. They are just a search away. Looking at reviews, sales rankings and marketing materials of competing apps can give you great insight into the market. It is <strong>a great way to see the market for your app</strong>, how much people are willing to pay for it, what features to include, and a slew of other insights. Websites such as <a href="http://www.appannie.com">App Annie</a> even enable you to analyze your competitors’ rankings over time.</p>
<p>We took about a dozen of the best competing apps and analyzed their strengths and weaknesses and how we could beat them. We found that, while a number of offline translation apps existed, they were poorly designed and cost a fortune. We knew we could do better.</p>
<h4>User Experience Mapping</h4>
<p>In defining the app, we focused on solving a few <strong>problems that people actually experience</strong> in their daily life, rather than just coming up with a list of cool features. To this end, we went through a little exercise that we call user experience mapping. This exercise generally takes a day or three. In it, we did the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze users’ daily experience without the app &mdash; i.e. identify the problems they currently face.</li>
<li>Brainstorm ways that an ideal app could solve those problems.</li>
<li>Choose which problems to focus on, and decide which features were feasible for the first release.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 1: Define Personas</strong></p>
<p>As designers, we need to thoroughly empathize with our users and understand their current experiences and thought processes as much as possible. Going out and talking to people can yield a lot of great insight, but in this case we were were pretty familiar with the translation experience, so we didn’t feel the need to talk to potential users at this stage.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/users-large.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/users-small.png" alt="Characteristics" width="500" height="323" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136576" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/users-large.png">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>Instead, we went ahead and started brainstorming potential characteristics of our users.</p>
<p>We then chose characteristics of users who we really wanted to focus on, and turned them into personas.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/personas-large.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/personas-small.png" alt="Personas" width="500" height="322" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136577" /></a></p>
<p>A persona is a <strong>fictitious person</strong> who embodies the characteristics of the target demographic. While personas aren’t real, they should be based on reality and should make the abstract idea of a “user” much more concrete. Without a human face, mapping out the user’s experience is hard.</p>
<p>So, Emily is a 21-year-old college student studying French at Emory University. She is not naturally gifted in language, but really likes French and tries to read French literature. She is looking forward to doing a study-abroad program in France.</p>
<p>We created three personas that encapsulate most of the key characteristics of our target market: Emily, the student; Johann, the European business traveler (it turns out that we nailed this: 70% of our sales ended up being from outside the US); and Paul, the IT guy who learns new languages as a hobby.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Map the Personas’ Experience Without the App</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/personas2-large.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/personas2-small.png" alt="UX Map" width="500" height="321" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136578" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/personas2-large.png">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>To map out users’ current predicament, we started by picking three key experiences related to translation &mdash; in this case, solo translation, social translation, and translation during travel.</p>
<p>We then brainstormed the activities and issues involved in these experiences that each persona might face. For example, in the solo category, Johann writes emails to clients in various languages and looks up the words he is not sure of.</p>
<p>Perform this exercise with people in the room who are similar to your personas. They will validate your insights and add to the brainstorming. If you don’t have that luxury, simply brainstorming and thinking through their possible experience is still a helpful exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Brainstorm the Ideal Assistance</strong></p>
<p>After picturing our users’ lives, we brainstormed how the ideal app could solve their problems. We didn’t worry about viability, budget or timeline here; it’s all about coming up with really creative ideas to solve our users’ problems.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Kill the Baby</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/finally-now-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/finally-now-small.jpg" alt="Kill Baby" width="500" height="316" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136575" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/finally-now-large.jpg">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>This part is brutal. Having come up with a ton of cool ideas for features, we had to obliterate most of them. Good design is more about subtraction than addition. It’s all about finding the essential problems you want to solve and removing the features that are unrelated, inessential or unrealistic for the first version.</p>
<p>Polishing an app takes a ridiculous amount of time. So, if you start out with too broad a feature set, your app will lack focus and you will have no way to polish those features adequately.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/contexts-large.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/contexts-small.png" alt="Features" width="500" height="323" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136579" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/contexts-large.png">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>Mission accomplished. Now we had a tentative 1.0 definition. Now we knew what this app would be about. You can read more about <a href="http://tapity.com/iphone-app-design/user-experience-mapping-strategic-design-part-3/">our user experience mapping exercise</a> on our blog.</p>
<h4>The Definition</h4>
<p>Based on the last exercise, we crafted a statement that defines the essence of the app:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;An offline translation dictionary that gives instant access to words and definitions at 99¢ for multiple language pairs.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement helped to focus our development process. It became a litmus test for any cool feature idea we came up with during development. If the feature didn’t support this statement, it didn’t belong in 1.0.</p>
<h3>Sketching The Interactions</h3>
<p>It was time to get down and dirty and start to shape our abstract ideas into a blueprint.</p>
<p>We started by sketching general ideas on how the various screens could flow together. These days, I mostly stick to sketches, and I use tools such as <a href="http://popapp.in">POP</a> to share ideas with remote team members and clients. At the time, however, we were using <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a> to create a rough prototype of the interactions.</p>
<h4>Don’t Make Me Think</h4>
<p>Our goal at this stage was to solve our users’ problems with an intuitive and easy to use interface. In essence, our job was to free users from having to think about the interface and instead to focus on the content.</p>
<p>This is a huge topic and Steve Krug literally wrote the book on it, so if you haven’t read <a href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html"><em>Don’t Make Me Think</em></a>, do so now. Seriously, it’s a great book.</p>
<h4>Don’t Make Me Work</h4>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mockup-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mockup-small.jpg" alt="OmniGraffle" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136534" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mockup-large.jpg">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>People don’t like to work, so I am always looking for ways to save them from unnecessary keystrokes, taps and irrelevant information. The OmniGraffle wireframe above illustrates how we tried to serve that goal. We wanted our word lookup to be the fastest available; so, instead of providing on-the-fly search suggestions like most apps, we provide on-the-fly translations to those suggestions. We also found a way to solve the language-switching problem of most apps by enabling users to type in either language and displaying the results for one language on the left and the other language on the right.</p>
<h4>Think Like a Human</h4>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/dictionary-shelf-large.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/dictionary-shelf.png" alt="Shelf" width="328" height="572" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136581" /></a><br />
<em>We wanted our dictionaries to feel physical. <a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/dictionary-shelf-large.png">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>Because this is an offline translation app, we wanted to give users the strong impression that the dictionaries are on their phones. We wanted the dictionaries to feel <strong>not like some abstract database</strong> in the cloud, but rather like physical dictionaries that they can access anytime, anywhere. We used the metaphor of a shelf with books to quickly communicate this to users.</p>
<p>While touch interfaces have matured, and users no longer need interfaces to look like physical objects in order to relate to them, sometimes physical metaphors can set expectations and convey feelings that purely digital interfaces cannot.</p>
<h4>Relentless Exploration</h4>
<p>Note that these wireframes are ugly on purpose. This stage has nothing to do with visual design. We don’t jump right into Photoshop, because the ugly sketches help us to focus on the interaction problems and enable us to quickly explore hundreds of ideas.</p>
<p>Because sketching a rough idea takes only a few seconds, we go really crazy at this stage. The more ideas, the better. Leave no stone unturned to find the ideas worth pursuing.</p>
<p>Sometimes your first idea turns out to be the best, but the only way to prove that is to test all of the other ways of looking at the problem. I’ve gotten to meet the designers of some of my favorite apps, and one of the main commonalities among them is this: The secret to their amazing designs is a lot less about genius than about relentless exploration. They don’t stop once they’ve found a good solution. <strong>They keep going until they’ve exhausted the possibilities.</strong></p>
<h3>Of Photoshop And Xcode</h3>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/phone-laptop-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/phone-laptop-small.jpg" alt="Photoshop" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136484" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/phone-laptop-large.jpg">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>This is when things get really exciting. It’s when ideas start to become reality. This is the point when we design and code the actual elements that our users will touch.</p>
<p>Some people think this stage is just about making pretty graphics, but that mindset leads to mediocrity. This stage is all about polish on all levels: interaction, usability and visual. <strong>This is when a good app becomes great.</strong></p>
<p>While we hoped that our sketches and wireframes would provide a good outline, upon seeing things visually and playing with an actual coded prototype, we realized that we sometimes got it all wrong. Also, when we are merely sketching, it is difficult to imagine the creative details that will take our app beyond being usable and into the realm of fun. Once we start working with visual metaphors, colors and textures, dreaming up fun details becomes much easier.</p>
<p>So, this is all about polish, polish, polish, and it is by far the most rewarding and time-consuming stage of app development.</p>
<h4>Establishing the Theme</h4>
<p>Some people hate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphism</a>, probably because mimicking elements from the real world in our digital interfaces can easily lead to overdesigned visuals and inconsistent interactions. However, skeuomorphism can be useful, fun and powerful if wielded carefully and deliberately. In fact, every app that contains buttons has skeuomorphism because buttons are borrowed straight from the real world. When used correctly, skeuomorphism provides much needed affordances that help users instantly understand how an app works.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we knew from the outset that we wanted to use the metaphor of physical books to reinforce the concept that these dictionaries are stored on the phone itself.</p>
<p>When working on the theme for the app, we generally iterated like crazy on two or three of the main screens until we were convinced that a certain look would work really well for the whole app.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop-preview-large1.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop-preview-small.jpg" alt="Book-like theme" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136543" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/desktop-preview-large1.jpg">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>Given that we were working towards a book-like theme, we explored an elegant earth-toned theme that let the content and typography shine. We continued to refine the theme along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Side note:</strong> While the next version of iOS &mdash; iOS 7 &mdash; will rid itself of Corinthian leather and other such ornamental UI, and the industry is certainly shifting away from realistic interfaces at the moment, the best designers don’t just follow trends. Trends are important, but we should consider all styles and techniques as tools in our toolbox and use them where they make sense. Granted, realistic UIs will probably look quite dated by the time iOS 7 arrives, but within a year or so, diversity in design styles will intensify as the novelty of iOS 7’s minimal aesthetic begins to wear off.</p>
<h4>Delight Is in the Details</h4>
<p>As we continued to flesh out all of the different screens, we looked for opportunities to delight our users with details that would make the app enjoyable to use. Part of this is just about making the app look nice, but you can also delight users by adding a fun transition, or make them laugh with some quirky copy, or save them work in surprising ways.</p>
<p>Take search:</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/accordeon-effect-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/accordeon-effect-small.jpg" alt="Swipe to search" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136492" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/accordeon-effect-large.jpg">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>The user can start searching by tapping the search bar. But reaching for that bar with a thumb can be a hassle, so we added the ability to swipe anywhere on the screen to unfold the search interface.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/highlighting-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/highlighting-small.jpg" alt="Search" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136598" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/highlighting-large.jpg">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>As the user types, the interface populates with suggested results and translations, highlighting the matching letters like a spotlight.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/typing-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/typing-small.jpg" alt="Swipe to clear" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136571" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/typing-large.jpg">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>Folks who translate speech or passages of literature will look up a lot of words in rapid succession. We found that having to clear a search term by tapping the tiny “x” in the search field broke the flow and was physically strenuous, especially on the iPhone 5’s taller screen. So, we decided to let users swipe right to quickly clear a term &mdash; thus, allowing them to type a few letters, get the translation, and then swipe to begin typing another word all in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>These kinds of details made all the difference when we were testing the app in the wild.</p>
<h4>Designer and Programmer: Constant Collaboration</h4>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/working-guy-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/working-guy.jpg" alt="Collaboration" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136539" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/working-guy-large.jpg">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>Please, please, do not hand a programmer your design assets and expect a job well done. Not only do designers need to continually stay involved to ensure that their designs are implemented well, but using coded prototypes and testing them on users will inform the design in ways you can’t imagine. I don’t care what kind of genius designer you are: There is no substitute for testing a design and iterating on it.</p>
<p>Testing coded software exposes blatant weaknesses in the design that you may have never considered and shines light on areas where details could be added to make the experience more enjoyable. Because of this, I ended up doing even more design iterations after we had a coded prototype than I did before.</p>
<p>Changes at this stage are costly but extremely necessary.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/preview-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/preview-small.jpg" alt="Magnify" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136572" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/preview-large.jpg">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>Programmers with a good design sense can also have great ideas. We wanted to make a better index. My mental model was some kind of magnifying glass. But Richard, Sonico’s programmer, had a better idea: Magnify the letters themselves around your finger as you move your finger.</p>
<h4>Gesture Experiments</h4>
<p>As we started to code our first prototype, Impending and Realmac Software launched an app named <a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/">Clear</a>. No buttons, just gestures. Love it or hate it, it made a statement. I had never seen such an exercise in minimalism in my life.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful thing, and it inspired me to find ways to use gestures to improve Languages.</p>
<p>My first experiment was extreme: to create a fully gesture-based interface.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/preview3-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/preview3-small.jpg" alt="Gestures" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136573" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/preview3-large.jpg">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>We replaced buttons with gestures. Swipe one way to search, and the other way to view the index.</p>
<p>As much as we loved the minimalism, we realized that we needed to teach our users about the gestures.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/swipe-to-search-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/swipe-to-search-small.jpg" alt="Gestures" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136574" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/swipe-to-search-large.jpg">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>We tried a number of approaches. But after doing a lot of usability testing, we realized that all of them had one major problem: Search, our most important feature, just wasn’t blatantly obvious.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/app-preview2-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/app-preview2-small.jpg" alt="Dictionary" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-136514" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/app-preview2-large.jpg">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>So, we bit the bullet and used buttons and affordances where they make sense, but we retained a lot of the gestures and minimalism that we had gained through the experiments. The result was an app that is super-intuitive and simple for beginners, but full of gestures that make life easier for power users.</p>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>We made sure to get input on all aspects: usability, beauty, robustness. This included carrying out the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>We observed friends, family and various strangers use the app. The key thing here is to propose tasks and ask questions about what they are thinking, but never to answer their questions. Probe into why they are confused about something, and let them figure it out for themselves. Watch for body language that indicates confusion or frustration, and note not only whether they were able to accomplish a task, but how effortless and enjoyable their experience was.</li>
<li>We sought expert design reviews from top Apple designers, leading usability experts and fellow developers at conferences such as SxSW and WWDC.</li>
<li>We posted screenshots to <a href="http://www.dribbble.com/jerols">Dribbble</a> to get feedback on visuals from leading designers around the world.</li>
<li>We tested the app ourselves in real-world contexts using <a href="http://www.testflightapp.com">TestFlight</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, we thoroughly tested functionality and searched hundreds of words to catch bugs and ensure robustness and accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Icon</h4>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ideas-large.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ideas-small.jpg" alt="We tried a lot of ideas before settling on the icon to the far right" width="500" height="375" class="size-large wp-image-136604" /></a><br />
<em>We tried a lot of ideas before settling on the icon on the far right. <a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ideas-large.png">Large view</a>.</em></p>
<p>An app’s icon means a lot. It is the first impression most users will get of an app, and we hope users will want to have it on their precious home screen.</p>
<p>The first iteration of the Languages icon (the royal “L”) was simple but didn’t communicate much.</p>
<p>After a lot of brainstorming, we incorporated the idea of physical dictionaries on a shelf, since that was a major theme of the app. The icon was beautiful, but we couldn’t make it work well enough at small sizes. Additionally, a top designer at Apple recommended that we not use books because the app isn’t about reading.</p>
<p>Nuts. We really liked that icon, but we had to go back to the drawing board to <strong>find an instantly recognizable symbol</strong> that communicated the idea of translation and that wasn’t overused. A globe works pretty well, but we ultimately chose the “a” with an accent mark because it is unique and definitely communicates the idea of a foreign language. We lived with it on our home screens for a while, and it grew on us. Having aced the test of time, the icon proved to be the winner.</p>
<h3>Next Step: Launch</h3>

<p>We’ve come along way and learned a few things.</p>
<p>After a year of blood, sweat and tears, the product was finally where we wanted it to be. It didn’t have every feature that we intended to put in 1.0, but the features it did have were super-polished and ready for primetime. It was time to launch. I’ll cover our marketing and launch in my next post, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the staggering array of resources and options available to designers. In this article, we’ll explore the idea of consciously restricting yourself to a set of core tools that you know, love and trust.</p>
<p>Take a traditional craftsman &mdash; let’s say a carpenter. While they may have access to a wide range of tools in their workshop, they will take a bag with just a few carefully chosen tools when working away. Similarly, an artist may have a wide range of paints, brushes and accessories in their studio, but will carefully select a limited palette and a few choice brushes when painting in the field.</p>
<p>In the same way, as a digital designer, <strong>you should know what your most precious tools are</strong>, and keep a portable set close at hand.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve been doing some oil paintings outside, away from the studio (a technique called <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_plein_air">en plein air</a></em>). To facilitate this, I put together a pochade box to hold paints, brushes, palette and canvas panels. This needed to be small enough to fit in a backpack to be easily portable so that I can cycle around the countryside with it. The factors of space and weight force me to select a limited palette and a few choice brushes, and the size of the box determines the size of paintings I can make.</p>
<p>Working outside also forces me to work quickly &mdash; there’s no time to dally and over-think things. But, rather than being restrictions, these factors become the parameters for the work, directing me to work in a certain way, and helping me to develop a personal style and approach.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pochade_big_mini.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pochade2_mini.jpg" alt="plein air" width="500" height="335" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-163935" /></a><br />
<em>Working outdoors forces you to set limits.</em></p>
<h3>Working With A Limited Palette</h3>
<p>The benefits of working with a restricted range of tools and options are that you really get to know and understand your core set and can continually refine it over time. This is the path to mastery in your chosen discipline, as opposed to being a jack-of-all-trades but the master of none.</p>
<p>By mastering a limited number of tools and techniques, you will develop your own personal, identifiable style and workflow. It enables you to hit the ground running with each new project, to draw on your previous experience and to get something down quickly, which you can then refine, rather than face the blank screen and not know where to start.</p>
<h3>A Lean, Portable Toolkit</h3>
<p>What should be in your toolkit? This will obviously depend on your particular area of expertise, whether you are a designer or a developer, and the software applications you use. Each person will have their own software preferences, so I am not going to talk much about particular applications in this article. Instead, the focus will be on areas where you can consciously refine your choice of tools and assets within applications. I’ll also look at how, once you have created this limited palette, you can access your carefully selected toolkit wherever you are.</p>
<h3>Keeping It All Together</h3>
<p>Keep this lean, mean toolkit in a place you can access from anywhere. My preference is <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, although any cloud-based hosting service, such as <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> or <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/skydrive/download">Microsoft Skydrive</a>, would be great. Create a folder named <em>Design Playbook</em>, or whatever, and add subfolders for all of the assets you want to store in there. Sync it to the cloud and you’re good to go. For text and notes, I use <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> &mdash; again, allowing me to access it from anywhere.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/folder_structure_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/folder_structure_mini.jpg" alt="Folder structure" width="500" height="394" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-161424" /></a><br />
<em>A sample folder structure of the toolkit</em></p>
<h3>Graphic Resources</h3>
<p>Grabbing every free resource you come across on the Web is tempting, whether it is vector art, Photoshop brushes and actions, bitmap textures and backgrounds, fonts, etc. But the downside of amassing such a huge collection is that it can become overwhelming and can lead to a lot of wasted time looking for just the right resource. If you are a download junkie, like me, then be prepared to pare down your collection, and put the ones you love and trust into a separate folder from all of the others, which you can review from time to time. Think of this separate folder as a special place where only the best assets and resources go.</p>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong> are a prime cause of bloat. Over 300 fonts are in my font library, which I manage using Font Agent Pro (available for both <a href="http://www.insidersoftware.com/FA_pro_osx.php">Mac</a> and <a href="https://www.insidersoftware.com/FA_win.php">Windows</a>), but I find myself using the same 10 or so for most commercial work, and many of the 300 I’ll probably never use. Sifting through all of them is a real time sink, so I have a couple of sets with all of my go-to typefaces, which I have copied in Dropbox. The same applies to Web-based type management, such as <a href="https://typekit.com">Typekit</a>. Find great type combinations that work for you, and use them repeatedly. It’s a part of how you establish your own recognizable style. Add new typefaces to your core collection sparingly.</p>
<p><strong>Brushes</strong> (which are customizable plugins to apply paint effects in applications such as Photoshop, CorelDraw and Painter) are another resource for which too wide a choice would be overwhelming and inefficient &mdash; you’d find yourself scrolling through a huge list trying to find the one you’ve used before. Don’t be afraid to trim down the brush sets that you download, deleting the ones you have no use for. Save a consolidated set of brushes as a new set to your mobile toolkit and you’ll be good to go. The same approach can be applied to symbol libraries for Illustrator and Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Illustration</strong> is one area in which your personal style can really shine through, so build a resource of vector elements. Having a collection of killer elements on hand is a great way to dive into a project and get inspiration. I’ve been slowly adding elements to my <code>vector doodads</code> Illustrator file for a couple of years now, inspired by the efforts of <a href="http://designbum.net">DesignBum</a>, who has made a number of his project files available for downloading.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.designbum.net"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/designbum_mini.jpg" alt="Designbum design elements" width="500" height="393" class="size-full wp-image-161422" /></a><br />
<em>Great design explorations by Issara Willenskomer (aka DesignBum)</em></p>
<p>You’ll find yourself reusing certain background elements and textures; so, again, carefully select a few ones, and add them to your toolkit. Don’t worry about overusing these images &mdash; use them in comps and mockups, and then, once you have finalized the design, if you feel that you need a fresh image, go and find one. This will save you time from hunting for new images for every mockup.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/elements_mini.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/elements_mini.jpg" alt="Illustrator Elements" width="500" height="376" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-161423" /></a><br />
<em>Build your own elements file.</em></p>
<p>You may find an online repository such as <a href="https://layervault.com">LayerVault</a> or <a href="https://www.pixelapse.com">Pixelapse</a> to be useful for storing image and vector assets, especially if you collaborate with other designers and want to share your toolkit with them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.layervault.com"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/layervault.jpg" alt="layervault" width="500" height="413" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-161426" /></a><br />
<em>LayerVault is version-control software for designers.</em></p>
<h3>Code Resources</h3>
<p>As with graphics, you’ll inevitably find yourself wanting to use the same bits of code from one project to the next. Rather than constantly reinvent the wheel, <strong>reuse classes and functions and keep refining them</strong>.</p>
<p>If you work with a language such as Java or ActionScript, which support classes, then you’ll find yourself returning to the same third-party classes and libraries time and again, so keep them handy in your toolkit, and take the time to really understand them.</p>
<p>For other languages, such as JavaScript, group together functions that you commonly use in a self-contained <code>.js</code> library file. You can then keep this as part of your toolkit, or use a content delivery network such as <a href="http://www.cdn.net/">CDN.net</a>, so that you can directly reference it from your project.</p>
<p>Add to this, of course, essential third-party libraries, such as <a href="http://modernizr.com">Modernizr</a> and <a href="http://requirejs.org">Require.js</a> &mdash; I’m sure you have your own favorites &mdash; and any add-ons, such as small JavaScript libraries. Keep them somewhere handy, to be able to quickly drop them into a project.</p>
<p>Another place to put code libraries and classes is on a hosted version-control website, such as <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://beanstalkapp.com">Beanstalk</a> or, my personal choice, <a href="https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>. This is especially useful if you like to tinker and refine code or if you want to share your toolkit with other developers. If you want to open-source your code and make it publicly accessible, then GitHub or <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a> is ideal.</p>
<p>Another place to store code is <a href="http://snipplr.com">Snipplr</a>. As the name suggests, it’s great for storing little snippets of code &mdash; for example, code to retrieve the current date &mdash; that you’ll need time and again. You can make your snippets public or keep them to yourself. Snipplr is ideal for storing those little code hacks that you keep forgetting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.snipplr.com"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/snipplr.jpg" alt="snipplr" width="500" height="301" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-161427" /></a><br />
<em>Snipplr is great for storing and sharing useful code snippets.</em></p>
<h3>Template Resources</h3>
<p>Using Web templates and frameworks will help you create prototypes more quickly and will also ensure that those prototypes bear a close resemblance to your comps and mockups. Whether you develop your own framework from scratch or use a popular one, such as <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a> or <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, get to know it inside out, and keep refining it to suit your needs.</p>
<p>Also, build your own “boilerplate” HTML5 file, which is a minimal basic file that serves as the starting point for any Web page you create. <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> is a good place to start. You’ll also find it worthwhile to create a skeleton website, set up with a file structure for images, CSS and JavaScript. Build yourself a basic CSS file that you can drop into any project. Add it all to the toolkit.</p>
<h3>Mastering Your Tools</h3>
<p>It might sound like I am suggesting that you keep reusing the same look and techniques across all of your work, but that is not the case. I <em>am</em> suggesting that you consciously limit your toolset, and then absolutely master those tools. You can then refine them according to project briefs, client feedback and your own inclination.</p>
<p><a href="http://kevindart.tumblr.com"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kevin_dart_colouroid.jpg" alt="Kevin Dart Colouroid" width="500" height="500" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-161425" /></a><br />
<em>Kevin Dart’s Colouroids are a great example of self-set limitations.</em></p>
<p>Keep experimenting with your favorite tools. This year, inspired by Kevin Dart’s <a href="http://kevindart.tumblr.com">Colouroids</a>, I set myself a challenge to create one <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kosmograd/sets/72157632411035885/">vector image a day</a>, to really master Illustrator. In these self-set projects, go outside of your comfort zone and try a new approach, process or technique.</p>
<h3>Create A Playbook</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Design today has reached the stage where sheer inventiveness can no longer sustain it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&ndash; Christopher Alexander, 1963</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seek to master not just your tools but also your techniques. Understanding and refining your design process is critical, and <strong>the way you work will determine the work you produce</strong>. I call this your “playbook,” the guide to your design process. Each technique is a “play,” a set of instructions to follow.</p>
<p>The playbook can exist purely in your head, or be as formal as you like. My playbook is a series of notes and sketches on an iPad, using Evernote and <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper">Paper</a>. Some are simple aphorisms &mdash; “Work from light to dark,” “Remove one element” &mdash; to make me think about the way I work, a kind of personal set of <a href="http://oblicard.com">Oblique Strategies</a>, but used less to break a creative block than to reinforce a working method I trust.</p>
<p>Other “plays” are more practical guides, such as step-by-step instructions on how to set up event listeners, or how to optimize images, or how to change copy on a live website. Developing <strong>conscious design patterns</strong> is the key to understanding the way <em>you</em> work, whether in visual design, interaction design or programming.</p>
<p>Formalizing your creative processes, tools and techniques is a critical step in becoming a better designer or developer. Just as football teams practice their plays, practice your techniques on self-set work, ready to be deployed in client work once you have mastered them.</p>
<p>The playbook is also the place to refine your workflows. How do you get from a paper sketch to a working website? How do you wireframe your code? Analyzing your process is all part of the playbook.</p>
<h4>Evolving The Playbook And The Toolkit</h4>
<p>In addition to refining your playbook, you will also need to update it and evolve it gradually over time, adding some elements while removing others. Obviously, the world of Web design is changing rapidly, both aesthetically and technically, so make sure to update your playbook, too. And by using elements you know and trust, you are still bringing your own style, rather than slavishly following fashion.</p>
<h3>The Path Towards Mastery</h3>
<p>If you look at the portfolios of designers you admire, you will see common elements and ideas that unite each person’s work. This applies not only to Web designers but to graphic designers, architects, industrial designers and visual artists. While the work evolves over time, a common thread &mdash; and a conscious decision to set self-imposed limits of exploration &mdash; runs through it all. Each creator has developed and refined their own design process, which defines the resulting work, the designer’s style. Poor designers will leap from one style to another, from one way of working to another. Lacking conviction, they will follow trends and the latest fancy technique, rather than develop their own style.</p>
<p>Learn to limit your choices and set parameters. These are not constraints, but rather guidelines to lead you to better work. Building a toolkit and developing a playbook is a way to help you define your own style and to master the tools you need to make your work unique, personal and memorable.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, when consumer electronics such as vacuum cleaners and washing machines emerged, there was a belief that household chores would be done in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>We know now it didn’t work out that way. Our definition of clean changed. Instead of wearing underwear for multiple days, we started using a fresh pair every day, and so the amount of washing required increased. In short, technology enabled us to do more, not less.</p>
<p>Our work environments have followed a similar path. Tools such as email enable us to communicate more, rather than make life easier. In fact, many people are now overwhelmed by the amount of email they receive.</p>
<h3>The Problem Of Email</h3>
<p>Email has changed our expectations of communication; most of us feel like we need to be constantly available. We are tied to our email-enabled devices, and, like <a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/pavlov.html">Pavlov’s dog</a>, we have to check email every time the bell rings.</p>
<p>We are constantly available, constantly interrupted and continually overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Going offline isn’t the answer. As Web designers, we do not just build websites; we provide services to our clients. Therefore, we need to keep our clients happy, and that can only be done by regular communication. Clients need constant reassurance that their project is in hand, and they need continual chivying to provide the feedback and contributions we require to do our job.</p>
<p>Like it or not, email is a necessary evil. But that doesn’t mean it needs to rule us. We can tame the beast, and it all starts by doing less.</p>
<p><strong>Like any beast, the more you feed email, the bigger it becomes.</strong> It’s time to put email on a diet. We can achieve this in a simple way: by using email less.</p>
<h3>Send Less</h3>
<p>Believe it or not, doing considerably less with email while still effectively communicating with our clients and colleagues is perfectly possible.</p>
<p>You probably don’t need to send out nearly as many emails as you do. You could almost certainly reduce the number of people you copy in your emails. Remember that the more email you send out, the more email you will get back. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>Email is <strong>not always the best form of communication</strong>. A face-to-face meeting or a phone call is usually much more effective. After all, what we actually say is the minority of communication. Tone of voice and body language are critically important.</p>
<p>Instant messaging (IM) is another option to consider. While it is intrusive at times, it can be perfect for quick questions. Email encourages long-form communication, while IM tends to be shorter.</p>
<p>That being said, there is no reason why emails need to be long.</p>
<h3>Write Less</h3>
<p>The less you write in emails, the less people will write in reply. People tend to mirror the behavior of others; so, if you want to receive more concise emails, start writing emails that are to the point yourself.</p>
<p>You might feel that short emails are less friendly and come across as cold, but these problems can be worked around.</p>
<p>Try linking to <a href="http://five.sentenc.es">five.sentenc.es</a> in your signature. That website will perfectly explain the brevity of your emails.</p>
<p><a href="http://five.sentenc.es/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/skitch-500_mini.png" alt="skitch-500_mini" width="500" height="354" /></a><br />
<em>Linking to five.sentenc.es makes it clear to clients that you keep your emails short because you value their time. <a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/skitch_mini.png">Larger view</a>.</em></p>
<p>An even easier option is to adopt the “Sent from my phone” signature that many people use these days, a good excuse for getting to the point.</p>
<p>Please don’t misunderstand. Being friendly and personable with clients is important. But email is not the place to do that. <strong>If you want to chat, pick up the phone.</strong></p>
<p>Email should feel more like Twitter than traditional mail. In fact, many people are abandoning email entirely and turning to Twitter as their primary communication tool.</p>
<p>If this step feels too big, try summarizing your email at the top. This will make it easier for the reader to get the gist of your message if they are busy. Also, you will find that people start doing the same in their emails, making reading much quicker.</p>
<p>In addition to sending less email and shortening your messages, reducing the amount you receive is possible.</p>
<h3>Receive Less Email</h3>
<p>The easiest way to cut down on replies is to tell people that they do not need to reply. Putting abbreviations such as NRN (no reply necessary) or FYI (for your information) in the subject line will help with this. But that won’t stop unsolicited email.</p>
<p>Most of us get a lot of unsolicited email, despite the excellent spam filters that most email services provide. These emails are often newsletters that we’ve never subscribed to or announcements from companies from which we once made a purchase. Regardless of whether we ever did agree to receive these emails, they are now cluttering our inbox.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to just delete these and keep wading through the rest of your email. But take the time to find the “Unsubscribe” link, because these companies will not contact you just once. <strong>They will email you again and again until you stop them.</strong></p>
<p>If they don’t include an “Unsubscribe” link, create an email rule that automatically deletes them. Those couple of minutes now will save you time and distraction in the long run. If you really are too busy to find those “Unsubscribe” links, then try out <a href="https://unroll.me">Unroll.me</a>, which makes unsubscribing even easier.</p>
<p><a href="https://unroll.me"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Unroll.me_500_mini.png" alt="Unroll.me_500" width="500" height="367" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165131" /></a><br />
<em>Unroll.me makes unsubscribing to emails easier than ever. <a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Unroll.me_mini.png">Larger view</a>.</em></p>
<p>However you do it, unsubscribing from mass emails will dramatically reduce your load. But don’t stop there; consider unsubscribing from newsletters that you <em>did</em> sign up for.</p>
<h3>Keep Email For Communication Only</h3>
<p>Part of our problem is that we have turned email into something it naturally is not. For example, many people use their inbox as a place to read news. Email was never really meant for that. Ample apps (such as the wonderful <a href="http://cloud.feedly.com/#welcome">Feedly</a>) provide this functionality.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://cloud.feedly.com/#welcome"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Feedly_500_mini.png" alt="Feedly_500_mini" width="500" height="339" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165136" /></a><br />
<em>Use an app like Feedly to read news, rather than your email client. <a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Feedly_mini1.png">Larger view</a>.</em></p>
<p>Others use their email client as a repository for files that they want to keep. This makes little sense because a much more powerful filing system is built into their operating system.</p>
<p>And yet others use their inbox as a task manager, marking emails as starred or unread to remind themselves to take some action. However, dedicated tasks managers will help you work much more efficiently.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Omnifocus-2_mini_border.png" alt="Omnifocus 2_mini_border" width="500" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165339" /></a><br />
<em>Your email client is not nearly as good a task manager as applications such as <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>. Always use the best tool for the job. <a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Omnifocus-2_mini.png">Larger view</a>.</em></p>
<p>Turning email into something else merely clutters our inbox, making the job of reading and writing actual email less efficient.</p>
<p>To tame the beast, use email as a communication tool, not as a way to manage files, read news or schedule tasks.</p>
<p>While the techniques above will reduce the amount of email coming in, they address only the symptoms and not the root cause of our problem &mdash; which is our addiction to email.</p>
<h3>Breaking Our Addiction</h3>
<p>The reference earlier to our Pavlovian response to the audio notification of incoming email was slightly tongue in cheek, but accurate nonetheless.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that beep, we find it hard not to look. But checking email every five minutes adds up to over <strong>32,000 interruptions a year</strong>! That is a phenomenal number.</p>
<p>Do we really need to check email that much? Almost certainly not. The majority of email that comes in either is unsolicited or can wait a few hours. The number of emails that genuinely require urgent action is relatively low.</p>
<p>The problem is that we perceive certain emails as being urgent when they are not. It’s just a matter of training our clients not to expect an immediate response. Of course, that is not always possible.</p>
<p>What we need is a way to <strong>be notified of only the important emails</strong>. Fortunately, achieving this is relatively easy. Start by turning off notifications in your email client. They are just too indiscriminate, notifying you of every single message that comes in.</p>
<p>Instead, sign up for a service, such as <a href="http://awayfind.com/">AwayFind</a>, that will notify you by text or app notification when an email comes in that meets certain requirements. For example, you could choose to receive notifications only of emails from a particular client or about that day’s meeting.</p>
<p><a href="http://awayfind.com/"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Awayfind.com_500_mini.png" alt="Awayfind.com_500_mini" width="500" height="390" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-165140" /></a><br />
<em>AwayFind notifies you about only the most important emails, freeing you from the shackles of constant alerts. <a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Awayfind.com_mini.png">Larger view</a>.</em></p>
<p>If you don’t want to pay for this service, you could try <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.</p>
<p>The point is to <strong>free yourself from constant interruption</strong>. Knowing that important messages will reach you instantly, you can comfortably check email only a couple of times a day. I check email first thing in the morning, at lunchtime and at the end of the business day. That way, I can respond reasonably promptly without having my workflow interrupted.</p>
<p>And when you do check your email, be organized in the way you deal with it.</p>
<h3>Organizing Your Email</h3>
<p>A lot of people make email more complicated than it needs to be because they are not organized. The biggest offenders are those who never move email out of their inbox.</p>
<p>Having an inbox filled with hundreds or thousands of emails increases the time it takes to process new messages. With so much clutter, figuring out what needs to be dealt with and what has been read becomes confusing. No matter how in control you may feel, things are bound to fall between the cracks.</p>
<p>Your inbox is where email arrives, but it shouldn’t stay there. Instead, clear your inbox every time you open your email client. You don’t necessarily have to act on every email right away &mdash; just read it and decide what to do with it.</p>
<p>You have five options upon reading an email:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Act on it.</strong><br />
If you have time to act on the email immediately, then do so. This could mean responding or completing a task. But don’t feel obliged to act immediately if you have higher priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Defer it.</strong><br />
Too busy to deal with the email immediately? No problem. Turn it into a task that sits in your task manager. You can then deal with it on your own time and view it alongside your other tasks.</li>
<li><strong>File it.</strong><br />
Many emails we receive require no particular action, but merely provide useful information. In such cases, archive the post for future reference. With today’s powerful search tools, there is little need to tag it or add it to a folder. But do move it out of the inbox.</li>
<li><strong>Delete it.</strong><br />
If the email is spam or has no long-term value, delete it.</li>
<li><strong>Delegate it.</strong><br />
Some emails require action, but you might not be the best person to do it. In those cases, delegate the task by forwarding the email to the relevant person.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lesson in all of this is that your inbox is just a holding place for unprocessed email. Once you have read it and decided what to do with it, move it out of your inbox to make room for future emails.</p>
<h3>Start Today</h3>
<p>You might be intimidated by the prospect of having to process all of those emails staring back at you in your inbox. This might all sound like too much work. I promise you it will be worth it.</p>
<p>If the inbox is too overwhelming, just declare bankruptcy. Archive everything except this week’s email. If any emails from more than a week ago haven’t been addressed yet, replying to them now would probably be too late anyway.</p>
<p>Archiving all of that email will leave you with a manageable load. Work through each email and decide what to do with it. If you get a lot of email, this could take some time, but it will be worth it. Remember that you don’t have to act on everything immediately. Defer actions until later by bouncing them to your task list. <strong>The trick is to process everything out of your inbox.</strong> Do that and I promise you will never look at email with the same horror again.</p>
<p>So, those are my tips on managing email. What are yours? What do you think of email clients such as <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com">Mailbox</a>? Or have you a completely different approach? Let us know in the comments. We’d love to hear your perspective.</p>

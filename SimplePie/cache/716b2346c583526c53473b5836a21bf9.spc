However, all applicants&#8217; income claims in 2014 will be checked against federal data, and &#8220;a statistically significant sample&#8221; of suspect applications will be subject to further income verification.</p>
<p>At a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfwFzY9qsZY">July 10 news conference</a> hosted by Senate Republicans critical of the health care law, Blunt claimed there would be no verification &#8212; and possibly no penalty &#8212; for lying to the government in an attempt to get tax credits to buy insurance on the soon-to-launched exchanges:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Blunt, July 10 (9:20 and 20:39 marks):</strong> And you know, the other thing, besides waiving the employer requirement, is they waived the income verification requirement. You all remember that up to 400 percent of poverty [level], you get some assistance in buying your individual insurance, but now you self-verify what your income is. There&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s a reasonable way to ask people to qualify for a new benefit, that you say what you think your income&#8217;s going to be with no way to verify that. &#8230;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no IRS check. There&#8217;s no &#8212; I don&#8217;t even know if there are any penalties if you verify wrong. You just say, &#8220;Well, I made $80,000 last year as a family,&#8221; which is about the cap, is around $80,000 or $90,000 for a family of four. You still get assistance at that level.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Missouri Republican goes way beyond the facts here. It&#8217;s simply not true that there&#8217;s &#8220;no way to verify&#8221; what applicants list as their income on tax credit applications. The insurance exchanges will compare all income figures with federal information, such as tax filings, and will ask for additional information if an applicant doesn&#8217;t have a previous tax filing.</p>
<p>Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which issued the rules on this, explained the process in a <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/blog/2013/07/myth-fact-marketplace.html">&#8220;myth vs. fact&#8221; post</a> on July 9:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Tavenner, July 9: </strong>No matter which type of  Marketplace is operating in a state, the Marketplace will always check  the income information submitted by individuals against electronic  income data sources such as tax filings, Social Security data, and  current wage information. In most circumstances, we will request  additional documentation from all affected individuals, such as when an  individual does not have a tax return on file and attests to an income  significantly below current wage data.</p></blockquote>
<p>A CMS spokesperson told us that applicants would have to submit additional documentation if the IRS had no data on the individual and current income data wasn&#8217;t available either.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2013-16271.pdf">new rules</a> (see pages 346-347) state that the &#8220;temporarily expanded discretion&#8221; for 2014 that&#8217;s being given to the exchanges will pertain when an applicants&#8217; &#8220;attested annual household income is more than 10 percent below&#8221; what is shown by government data, and data on modified adjusted gross income is unavailable, and the explanation from an applicant is &#8220;insufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rules used to require that the exchanges then seek further verification for all of the suspect applications. Now, the exchanges only have to check &#8220;a statistically significant sample of the population that would otherwise be subject to such procedures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The language of the rules can be a bit cumbersome, but they match Tavenner&#8217;s explanation, which skips the legislative-ese.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Tavenner, July 9:</strong> We will request additional documentation from a random sampling of individuals only in the specific circumstance when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current income information is not available;</li>
<li>There is a significant discrepancy between the income reported on an available tax return and the income provided by the individual; and</li>
<li>The individual cannot provide an acceptable explanation for this discrepancy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We asked Blunt&#8217;s office how he could claim that the income verification requirement had been &#8220;waived&#8221; and that there was &#8220;no way to verify&#8221; what people listed as their income. Spokeswoman Amber Marchand said that checking only a sample of suspect applications gives people the opportunity to potentially get away with lying about their income. Marchand wrote in an email: &#8220;Senator Blunt was providing a simple illustration regarding how this massive law could open the door to greater fraud and abuse. As you noted, the new rules mean that the exchanges will now only verify a ‘statistically significant sample’ of those who report more than 10 percent less income than they did before. That’s not everyone. For those who report less than 10 percent, there’s absolutely no check.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that if folks want to take the gamble with their fraudulent applications, there&#8217;s less of a chance of getting caught &#8212; at least right away. But that&#8217;s not what Blunt said. Instead, he unequivocally stated that &#8220;you say what you think your income&#8217;s going to be with no way to verify that.&#8221; That&#8217;s simply not true. Applications first will be checked against available income data. And applicants committing fraud can be subject to stiff penalties.</p>
<p>The senator went on to claim, &#8220;There&#8217;s no IRS check,&#8221; which is also wrong. The IRS will check what these applications say with 2014 tax returns filed later.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>CMS final rule, July 2013: </strong>We note that we believe this exercise of enforcement discretion concerning the Exchange’s obligations to verify income information in these specific circumstances is made in the context of all information – including the actual household income amounts for 2014 – being available at the end of the year for the reconciliation performed under section 36B(f) of the Code.</p></blockquote>
<p>Section <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/36B">36B(f) of the IRS Code</a> spells out the reconciliation procedure of advance tax credits. It says that &#8220;[i]f the advance payments to a taxpayer &#8230; exceed the credit allowed &#8230; the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year shall be increased by the amount of such excess.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are limits, however, on how much the IRS can recoup if the individual or family earned more than estimated but still made under 400 percent of the federal poverty level (the threshold for receiving insurance tax credits). That same section of the IRS code goes on to say that an individual earning between 300 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level could be liable for up to $1,250 in advance tax credit over-payments, with $2,500 as the limit for families in 2014.</p>
<p>Blunt also said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know if there are any penalties if you verify wrong.&#8221; Indeed, there are penalties. Tavenner wrote that violators face &#8220;existing penalties for perjury.&#8221; Plus, &#8220;the health care law applies penalties when an individual provides false or fraudulent information,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irs.gov/irm/part9/irm_09-001-003.html">IRS perjury penalties</a> include monetary fines and/or imprisonment. The Affordable Care Act calls for &#8220;a civil penalty of not more than $25,000&#8243; for providing false or fraudulent information due to &#8220;negligence or disregard of any rules or regulations&#8221; of the secretary of Health and Human Services. The law goes further for &#8220;any person who knowingly and willfully provides false or fraudulent information.&#8221; That civil penalty can be as high as $250,000. (See page 286 <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/law/title/i-quality-affordable-health-care.pdf">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Timothy S. Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law, who writes a blog about the health care law for the journal <em><a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2013/07/07/implementing-health-reform-final-rule-on-premium-tax-credit-medicaid-and-chip-eligibility-determinations-part-1/#more-32799">Health Affairs</a></em>, told us: &#8220;It is true that they have for the first year somewhat reduced the verification requirements, but it’s in a context of a pretty thorough system of verification and a pretty serious system of penalties.&#8221;</p>

That was in fact the effect of a decision announced recently by the Treasury.</p>
<p>The Treasury <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Continuing-to-Implement-the-ACA-in-a-Careful-Thoughtful-Manner-.aspx">announced</a> on July 2 that it was delaying for a year, until 2015, the Affordable Care Act requirement that large employers provide health coverage or face penalties.</p>
<p>In her <a href="http://www.c-span.org/flvPop.aspx?id=10737440412">weekly press conference</a> on July 11, House Democratic Leader Pelosi was asked about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/us/politics/house-gop-pushes-delay-on-individual-mandate-in-health-law.html?_r=0">Republican calls</a> to also delay the so-called individual mandate that will require people to buy insurance or face a tax penalty next year.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Pelosi, July 11</strong>: In fact, the point is, is that the mandate was not delayed. Certain reporting by businesses that could be perceived as onerous, that reporting requirement was delayed, and partially to review how it would work and how it could be better. It was not a delay of the mandate for the businesses, and there shouldn&#8217;t be a delay of the mandate for individuals. (Starts at the 9:06 mark.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to complaints from the business community about the complexity of reporting requirements under the Affordable Care Act, and the need for more time to implement them, the Treasury released a blog post on July 2 announcing the one-year reprieve.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mark J. Mazur, Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, July 2</strong>: The Administration is announcing that it will provide an additional year before the ACA mandatory employer and insurer reporting requirements begin.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result of the one-year delay in reporting requirements, the Treasury announced that it would also suspend the tax penalties for large businesses that fail to provide insurance to their employees &#8212; essentially the hammer behind the &#8220;mandate.&#8221; The law requires businesses with more than 50 employees to provide health coverage to all of their full-time workers (those working at least 30 hours per week) or face a tax penalty of $2,000 per employee.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mazur:</strong> We recognize that this transition relief will make it impractical to determine which employers owe shared responsibility payments (under section 4980H) for 2014.  Accordingly, we are extending this transition relief to the employer shared responsibility payments.  These payments will not apply for 2014.  Any employer shared responsibility payments will not apply until 2015.</p>
<p>During this 2014 transition period, we strongly encourage employers to maintain or expand health coverage.  Also, our actions today do not affect employees’ access to the premium tax credits available under the ACA (nor any other provision of the ACA).</p></blockquote>
<p>Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill noted that although &#8220;the employer responsibility requirement&#8221; has been pushed back to 2015, &#8220;employers will be encouraged to maintain or expand coverage during the 2014 transition period.&#8221; That&#8217;s true, but &#8220;strongly encourage&#8221; is not the same thing as &#8220;mandating&#8221; under the threat of a tax penalty.</p>
<p>Hammill also noted that the change &#8220;does not affect employees’ access to the premium tax credits available under the ACA or any other provision of the law.&#8221; And last, he noted that the vast majority of companies with more than 50 employees already offer appropriate health insurance, and would not be affected.</p>
<p>Former White House adviser Ezekiel J. Emanuel, who helped to design the law, wrote an <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/obamas-insurance-delay-wont-affect-many/">opinion piece for the <em>New York Times</em></a> making the same point: that the change would affect only a small percentage of large employers, and therefore it would not make a big overall difference in &#8220;the progress of reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the reporting requirements affect only businesses with more than 50 employees, Emanuel said it &#8220;turned out to be a nightmare&#8221; for some businesses to determine who should be counted as a full-time employee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hours of service include paid vacation and sick time, as well as things like jury duty,&#8221; Emanuel said. &#8220;And how do seasonal workers fit in, or people who work just one semester at an academic institution?&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result of the delay in reporting requirements, Emanuel, an oncologist and vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania, noted: &#8220;Larger employers will now have until 2015 before they will have to provide insurance or face penalties.&#8221;</p>
<p>In press conferences, White House spokesman Jay Carney has <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/08/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-07082013">repeatedly</a> <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/09/daily-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-07092013">referred</a> to a delay in the &#8220;employer responsibility provision.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Pelosi and the administration are simply parsing their words, said Paul Fronstin, director of the health research program at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Pelosi is correct that the change involved postponing reporting requirements, but if employers aren&#8217;t required to provide that information, there can be no enforcement through penalties. Tax penalties are the &#8220;mandate.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Pelosi may say it is not a delay of the employer mandate, only a delay in the reporting requirement, but &#8220;in practice, it boils down to the same thing,” Fronstin said. “The bottom line is the same.”</p>

<p>She further assumes the government is going to be intimately involved in her family&#8217;s health decisions in asking, &#8220;Can I really trust the folks in Washington with my family’s health care?&#8221; Unless Julie&#8217;s family becomes eligible for Medicaid under the law, she&#8217;ll be getting private insurance, just as she is now (as best we can infer from the ad).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMAuo4C8kk">TV spot</a>, which <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/americans-for-prosperity-2/">Americans for Prosperity</a> began airing in Ohio and Virginia July 9, directs viewers to the website ObamacareRiskFactors.com, which is more misleading than the ad itself. The site warns of reduced wages and hours for those who work for small employers that aren&#8217;t even subject to the law, for instance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Ad Wars Resume</strong></span></p>
<p>Over the past four years, the Affordable Care Act has been the focus of a hefty share of ad dollars. But those for and against aren&#8217;t done arguing about it yet &#8212; in fact, the war is heating up as major provisions of the law are about to take effect. In October, the health insurance exchanges will start accepting customers, and in 2014, the individual mandate, requiring most Americans to have insurance or pay a fine, kicks in.</p>
<p>So while Julie, a mother of two, prods viewers to feed their doubts about the law, another mom praises the benefits of the legislation in a <a href=" http://www.barackobama.com/health-care">TV ad from Organizing for Action</a>, a nonprofit group that advocates for the president&#8217;s policies. In that spot, airing on cable channels CNN, MSNBC, Bravo and Lifetime, Stacey Lihn says the law eliminated lifetime caps on coverage. True, <a href="http://kff.org/interactive/implementation-timeline/">lifetime limits were prohibited</a> early on, in 2010, and annual limits completely phase out on Jan. 1, 2014. Lihn, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention and has documented her family&#8217;s story on her <a href="http://thelihns.blogspot.com/">personal blog</a>, says that her daughter, Zoe, who was born with a congenital heart defect, &#8220;was halfway to her cap before her first birthday. Thanks to Obamacare, we can now afford the care that Zoe needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conservative ad is more general, and we don&#8217;t know much about the circumstances of the family in it. The mother, Julie, says her son had seizures two years ago and she has questions about Obamacare. Julie asks, &#8220;If we can&#8217;t pick our own doctor, how do I know my family&#8217;s going to get the care they need?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe style="width: 500px; height:300px;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="http://video.factcheck.org/play/3fb0b092fb3"></iframe></p>
<p>But Julie doesn&#8217;t mean that she won&#8217;t be able to actually select a physician on her own, as the question implies. Instead, the worry is that she won&#8217;t be able to keep her current doctor.</p>
<p>AFP spokesman Levi Russell told us that the law will limit provider networks and the choice of doctors for &#8220;millions&#8221; of Americans. But the support for that claim mainly pertains to those who would be buying their own insurance on new insurance exchanges or new Medicaid enrollees who will qualify for the program under the law&#8217;s Medicaid expansion. And most of those individuals will be newly insured.</p>
<p>We can infer from the ad that Julie&#8217;s family has insurance and wouldn&#8217;t  be seeking it on the exchanges or Medicaid. But we don&#8217;t know for sure.  Russell would not provide more information on Julie&#8217;s circumstances  other than to say she and her family are real, not actors. He said the group didn&#8217;t want to make Julie&#8217;s family the &#8220;centerpiece&#8221; of the ad campaign. &#8220;Instead, their experience should point others to go learn more for themselves and how they personally will be impacted,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume Julie&#8217;s family has employer-sponsored insurance, as 57 percent of non-elderly Americans do. AFP points out that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43900_ACAInsuranceCoverageEffects.pdf">has estimated</a> that those with work-based coverage will decline by 7 million, on net, because of the law by 2023.</p>
<p>That figure is a combination of workers losing coverage, others gaining it and others buying insurance elsewhere. The CBO estimated that for 2019 &#8212; when the net figure is 8 million &#8212; those losing an offer of employer-based insurance, which they would have received had the law not been enacted, would be 12 million, with 7 million others gaining work-based coverage because of the law, and 3 million more declining their employers&#8217; offer and getting insurance elsewhere. CBO <a href="http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10868/12-19-reid_letter_managers_correction_noted.pdf">has explained</a> in its previous estimates that businesses dropping coverage are likely to be smaller companies with low-income workers who would be able to get subsidies to buy insurance on the exchanges.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible Julie will find herself among the employees who lose coverage, buy a new plan elsewhere and not have her same doctor in the provider network. But her chances are small: 160 million Americans are expected to have work-based coverage in 2023 under the law, up from 155 million in 2013.</p>
<p>AFP provided two other pieces of support for this claim. A March 1, 2013, <em>Wall Street Journal </em><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323699704578328693720458354.html?mod=itp">article</a> said that some insurance plans sold on exchanges will likely have small networks of providers in order to keep premium costs down: The insurers were asking for a discount from hospital groups in exchange for the hospitals getting new customers as part of a small network. And a <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/31/8/1673.abstract"><em>Health Affairs</em> study</a> found 31 percent of doctors didn&#8217;t accept new Medicaid patients in 2011. That&#8217;s not due to the health care law, but it&#8217;s a concern since the law will expand Medicaid eligibility by about 12 million in the coming decade. That study also said an increase in fees to primary care physicians under the law &#8212; for 2013 and 2014 &#8212; could boost the acceptance rate, at least temporarily. But doctors not being open to new patients is a problem generally: Eighteen percent weren&#8217;t accepting new privately insured patients.</p>
<p>Perhaps more germane to this losing-your-doctor worry is the fact that the Affordable Care Act doesn&#8217;t guarantee &#8212; and simply can&#8217;t &#8212; that everyone who likes their doctor and their current health plan can keep them, as President Obama has often claimed. As <a href="http://factcheck.org/2012/06/romney-obama-uphold-health-care-falsehoods/">we&#8217;ve said before</a>, employers are free to switch or drop insurance plans under the law &#8212; just as they were before it was enacted. And workers who change jobs have no guarantee &#8212; before or after the law &#8212; that their new health plan will include their doctors in provider networks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Premiums, Pay Checks and Big Government<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>Julie goes on to ask, &#8220;What am I getting in exchange for higher premiums and a smaller paycheck?&#8221; Again, we don&#8217;t know Julie&#8217;s circumstances and why she assumes her paycheck is going to get smaller and her premiums are going up. But it&#8217;s true that expanded benefits required by the law have caused premiums for work-based plans to go up, on average.</p>
<p>When family premiums for employer plans jumped 9 percent from 2010 to 2011, <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/factchecking-health-insurance-premiums/">experts told us</a> the Affordable Care Act was responsible for a 1 percent to 3 percent hike, with the remainder due to higher medical costs, the usual culprit for increasing premiums. The law&#8217;s provisions that caused the bump were the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions for children, the requirement that dependents be covered on their parents&#8217; plan to age 26, free coverage of preventive care, and the increase in caps on annual coverage.</p>
<p>So those are some of the increased benefits that Julie is already getting in exchange for slightly higher premiums.</p>
<p>For 2012, employer-based insurance went up a <a href="http://kff.org/health-costs/perspective/pulling-it-together-reflections-on-this-years/">much smaller</a> <a href="http://kff.org/private-insurance/press-release/family-health-premiums-rise-4-percent-to/">4 percent on average</a>. The <a href="http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/Proj2011PDF.pdf">growth in national health spending</a> from 2009 to 2011 has been at historic lows, around 4 percent, and that trend is expected to continue for 2012 and 2013. Experts mainly say the down economy is the reason for reduced growth in spending, though <a href="http://factcheck.org/2013/02/factchecking-obamas-sotu/">it&#8217;s possible</a> the Affordable Care Act&#8217;s emphasis on new payment models may be leading to more efficient care by health care providers.</p>
<p>If Julie purchases her own insurance, it&#8217;s unknown what exactly would happen to her premium, as <a href="http://factcheck.org/2013/03/obamacare-to-cost-20000-a-family/">we&#8217;ve explained before</a>. Some individuals will pay more, and some will pay less. Some will get significantly more generous benefits for higher premiums; others may not even want a more generous plan. Benefits and premiums vary widely on that market, and the change in premiums for individuals will likely also vary widely &#8212; depending on what benefits they have now, health status, the protections of the state they live in and more. The Affordable Care Act does prevent discrimination based on preexisting conditions, limit variation in premium rates (to age, where you live, family size and tobacco use), and require a minimum benefit standard for these plans.</p>
<p>Most of those purchasing plans on the exchanges &#8212; about 80 percent &#8212; will qualify for government subsidies to offset the premium cost, <a href="http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43900_ACAInsuranceCoverageEffects.pdf">according to the Congressional Budget Office</a>. If Julie&#8217;s family earns up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level &#8212; $94,200 for a family of four &#8212; the family will qualify for a subsidy.</p>
<p>Finally, Julie wonders how well the government can manage her health care, asking, &#8220;Can I really trust the folks in Washington with my family’s health care?&#8221; But the law doesn&#8217;t put the government in charge of health care decisions &#8212; despite the <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2010/10/health-care-spin-again/">many claims</a> <a href="http://factcheck.org/2010/10/patakis-bogus-health-care-claims/">we&#8217;ve seen</a> <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2010/12/let-the-distortions-begin/">over the years</a> <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2013/03/bachmanns-killer-health-care-claims/">to the contrary</a>. This isn&#8217;t a <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2009/11/the-government-run-mantra/">&#8220;government-run&#8221;</a> plan or &#8220;takeover,&#8221; as so many have tried to claim. There&#8217;s no board <a href="http://factcheck.org/2012/01/neurological-death-panels/">deciding who gets brain surgery</a> or picking anybody&#8217;s doctor for them.</p>
<p>The law greatly expands private insurance, bringing millions of new customers to insurance companies. It&#8217;s true there are new insurance regulations as we&#8217;ve mentioned &#8212; no annual or lifetime limits on coverage, no preexisting condition exclusions, a standard set of minimum benefit requirements for plans on the exchanges. But those are consumer protections, not rules that put Washington in charge of managing families&#8217; health care.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>More Questions than Answers</strong></span></p>
<p>The AFP ad encourages viewers to visit ObamacareRiskFactors.com, where they can input some basic information about themselves and answer the question, &#8220;Are you at risk under the new healthcare law?&#8221; But don&#8217;t expect an unbiased answer.</p>
<p>When we said we worked for an employer with 0 to 50 employees, our first <a href="http://www.obamacareriskfactors.com/index.php/results/536">risk factor</a> was a warning that our hours or pay could be cut because of &#8220;requirements to provide insurance to all employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>The warning said that &#8220;government forces employers to make a difficult choice: reduce employee’s hours or wages or go out of business.&#8221; But employers with less than 50 full-time workers aren&#8217;t subject to any requirement to provide insurance to their employees. There was no mention of that, despite the fact that we had said we worked for a small employer. (The administration recently <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Continuing-to-Implement-the-ACA-in-a-Careful-Thoughtful-Manner-.aspx">announced</a> that it was delaying the requirement for employers with 50 or more workers for one year, until 2015.)</p>
<p>The risk factors we received also warned of &#8220;longer lines and delayed care,&#8221; citing a doctor shortage of 45,000 primary care physicians by 2020, estimated by the Association of American Medical Colleges. The warning doesn&#8217;t make clear that the AAMC said a shortage was predicted before the law was passed, but the shortage coupled with adding tens of millions to the rolls of the insured is certainly a legitimate concern. AAMC <a href="https://www.aamc.org/download/286592/data/">said</a> the coverage expansion will &#8220;exacerbate a physician shortage driven by the rapid expansion of the number of Americans over age 65.&#8221; It called for Medicare-funded residency training to help alleviate the problem.</p>
<p>AFP exaggerates by saying that &#8220;[t]hese problems will continue to get worse as one-third of doctors will retire over the next decade &#8212; many fueled by ObamaCare’s rules and regulations.&#8221; AAMC says simply that one-third will retire because &#8220;[o]ur doctors are getting older, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Americans for Prosperity almost gets it right when it says that &#8220;ObamaCare mandates that employers provide insurance coverage to all full-time employees, but it doesn’t mandate that coverage be provided for spouses or children.&#8221; The law does mandate that insurance policies cover children up to age 26. But it&#8217;s true there&#8217;s no mandate for coverage of spouses.</p>
<p>Of course, there was no mandate for employers to cover spouses before the law, and some firms have charged more for spouses or, for a small percentage of large firms, excluded them from coverage. The human resources consulting firm Mercer <a href="http://www.mercer.com/press-releases/1491670">has said</a> that its 2012 health benefits survey found 4 percent of employers with 5,000 or more employees denied coverage for spouses. MarketWatch reported in a <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-your-boss-is-dumping-your-wife-2013-02-22">February 2013 article</a> that the practice, primarily used for spouses who could get insurance through their own jobs, could increase as health care expenses continue to rise (with or without the Affordable Care Act) and as the state-based exchanges created under the law give spouses another option for coverage. MarketWatch quoted Joan Smyth, a benefits consultant at Mercer as saying, “When there’s a place for people to go, employers won’t feel as beholden or compelled to cover the spouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the lack of a spouse mandate will have an impact.</p>
<p>The risk factors also warned that &#8220;[f]ailing to purchase insurance will result in a tax penalty of $695.&#8221; <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2012/06/how-much-is-the-obamacare-tax/">True, when the law is fully implemented in 2016</a>. But the AFP site only tells half the story. It doesn&#8217;t ask whether individuals already have insurance or not, and it says nothing about opportunities for federal subsidies to help the uninsured buy coverage or expansion of Medicaid eligibility.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not suggesting that the Affordable Care Act shouldn&#8217;t prompt questions and concern from Americans. There are many unknowns about how exactly a law of this magnitude will play out, particularly its impact on those who buy their own insurance. But don&#8217;t expect honest answers from a partisan anti-Obamacare campaign.</p>

<ul>
<li>Labrador claimed the so-called &#8220;Gang of Eight&#8221; bill would give legal status to 11 million people currently living in the U.S. illegally. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the number to be about 8 million.</li>
<li>He also claimed Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano &#8220;has   already said that the border is secure,&#8221; and predicted she will tell  Congress &#8220;nothing  else needs to happen.&#8221; Napolitano repeatedly has said that the border &#8220;is as secure as  it&#8217;s ever been,&#8221; but more needs to  be done.</li>
<li>Labrador also said the bill would provide &#8220;20,000 non-ag[ricultural] guest workers per year for the entire United States.&#8221; That&#8217;s true for the first year, but it quickly ramps up to 75,000 by the fourth year.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">&#8216;Legalization of 11 million People&#8217;?</span></strong></p>
<p>Labrador, an <a href="labrador.house.gov">Idaho Republican</a>, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/52399650/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/t/july-bob-menendez-raul-labrador-robin-wright-tom-friedman-jeff-goldberg-chuck-todd-andrea-mitchell-ej-dionne-david-brooks-gene-robinson/#.UdrGB5yaZ_M">repeatedly exaggerated</a> the number of people living in the U.S. illegally who would gain legal status under the Senate bill. Twice, he said the figure was 11 million, including in the sentence below.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Labrador, July 7</strong>: &#8230; my concern with the Senate bill is that they put the legalization of 11 million people ahead of security. The legalization happens first, and then the security happens second.</p></blockquote>
<p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/s744.pdf">says in a June 2013 report</a> that there were &#8220;about 11.5 million unauthorized residents living in the United States at the end of 2011.&#8221; But not all of them would become legal under the <a href="http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=285276e0-9fe6-4914-a3b2-cac1e0c2c505">Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.</a> The CBO says &#8220;approximately 8 million of the unauthorized residents already in the country would obtain legal status&#8221; under the bill.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the Senate bill requires those living in the U.S. illegally to meet certain criteria before they can gain legal status. <a href="http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/faqs">A Q-and-A page on the website of Republican Sen. Marco Rubio</a>, a cosponsor of the bill, says those persons must “be fingerprinted, undergo criminal background checks, [and] pay fines and [back] taxes before any temporary status can be attained.”</p>
<p>CBO estimates that the vast majority of the 8 million would gain legal status as &#8220;Registered Provisional Immigrants,&#8221; or RPIs. And that&#8217;s just the first step toward permanent residency, <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/human-services/short-overview-of-2013-senate-immigration-bill.aspx">as explained</a> by the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>NCSL, April 26</strong>: Initial registration would be valid for six years then RPIs must apply for renewal, which requires a background check, additional fees and a fine along with proof of employment and proof that they will not become a public charge. After 10 years, RPIs can apply for an adjustment in status, like Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR), and, after three additional years, apply for naturalization. Fees and fines will need to be paid as well as demonstrated proof of employment, English language acquisition, and passing a background check, among other requirements.</p></blockquote>
<p>Labrador isn&#8217;t the only opponent of the Senate immigration bill to make such an exaggeration. In a June 25 floor speech (<a href="http://beta.congress.gov/crec/2013/06/25/CREC-2013-06-25.pdf">page S5140</a>), Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said the Senate bill &#8220;takes some 11 million people who are here illegally and it grants them what is called RPI status &#8212; registered provisional immigrant status.&#8221; That&#8217;s simply not so.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Border Security</strong></span></p>
<p>Labrador  repeated the 11 million figure when he questioned Napolitano&#8217;s commitment to border security. He said that he doesn&#8217;t trust the Obama administration to appropriately  secure the border, and that benchmarks must be part of a comprehensive  immigration bill before legalization of immigrants is allowed to move  forward.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Labrador, July 7</strong>:  If you give to this administration the authority to decide when they’re  going to enforce the law, how they’re going to enforce the law, and you  tell them that it’s okay if they decide if there’s going to be 20,000  &#8230; border patrol agents or they get to determine when the border is  secure, I can tell you that Janet Napolitano has already said that the  border is secure. So what’s going to happen is that we’re going to give  legalization to 11 million people and Janet Napolitano is going to come  to Congress and tell us that the border is already secure and nothing  else needs to happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>We contacted Labrador spokesman Todd Winer and asked when Napolitano said that &#8220;the border is secure.&#8221; Winer cited four instances. In an <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/power-players-abc-news/janet-napolitano-border-less-secure-because-budget-cuts-120328755.html">ABC News/Yahoo interview on March 4</a>, Napolitano said the border &#8220;is as secure as it&#8217;s ever been [in my experience].&#8221; Winer also cited a March 25, 2011, Associated Press report in which <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047102-503544.html">Napolitano stated</a> at the Bridge of The Americas border crossing in El Paso, Texas, that &#8220;[t]here is a perception that the border is worse now than it ever has been. That is wrong. The border is better now than it ever has been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Winer also cited <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jun/21/napolitano-approves-senates-border-security-plan/#ixzz2YYwgfeOi">Senate testimony</a> from Napolitano in which she stated: “Too often the border security refrain simply serves as an excuse. Our borders have in fact never been stronger.”</p>
<p>In all three instances, Napolitano used variations of the claim that the border is more secure <em>than it has ever been</em>. That&#8217;s different than saying the border is secure.</p>
<p>Last, Winer cited an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/03/janet-napolitano-says-border-security-trigger-unworkable/">ABC News account</a> of <a href="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/event/216242">a forum</a> hosted by the <em>Christian Science Monitor </em>on   March 26. At that event, Napolitano said &#8220;the border is as secure as it’s ever been,&#8221;   and she argued against &#8220;relying on one thing as a so-called trigger&#8221;  to  allow the legalization process to begin. But she didn&#8217;t claim that  the  border is already secure or that &#8220;nothing else needs to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the fuller context of her remarks:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Napolitano, March 26</strong>:   The numbers have been driven to 40 year lows if you just look at  things  like apprehensions. So we know we’re achieving success there.  But a  real measure is more qualitative. Really, when you step back and  think  about the border, what you want is the ability to spot illegal  traffic,  particularly in the highly trafficked areas &#8230; And then the  ability to  respond to what’s seen. And using that measure and the plans  we have,  we’re confident that the border is as secure as it’s ever  been. But  there’s no one number that captures that. That is the  problem, if you  are looking for just one number. Border security  encompasses a lot of  different things. But as we look at managing the  border, what we’re  looking for is the ability to detect illegal persons  and contraband  coming across the border and the ability to intercede.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later in the forum, Napolitano was asked directly about tying security triggers to legalization.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Napolitano, March 26</strong>:   I think once people really look at the whole system and how it works,   relying on one thing as a so-called trigger is not the way to go. There   needs to be certainty in the bill so that people know when they can   legalize and then when the pathway to citizenship, earned citizenship,   would open up. There’s also talk about getting in the back of the line.   That’s easier said than done &#8212; calculating what the line is at any  given  time. It moves. So those judgments will have to be made. But I  think  the key thing is to have border security in the bill, to open up  legal  migration more than it is, to deal with employers, and then to  have  certainty with how the 11 million here, who are either illegal or   undocumented, depending on what your vocabulary is, come out of the   shadows.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Napolitano argued against a single   metric as a trigger for legalization of immigrants, but she also stated that &#8220;the key thing is to have border security in the bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>She has consistently stressed, as she did in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvWBOAYey8k">remarks at  the Washington Conference on the Americas on May 8</a>, that more needs to be  done.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Napolitano, May 8:</strong> One of the  problems historically has been that once the attention is  turned to  something else, the resources go away. Those resources need  to be  sustained. This is a big border. It&#8217;s a heavily trafficked  border. And  we know we can do even more to secure it. So let no one  think there&#8217;s  not a commitment to doing that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, although not mentioned by Labrador&#8217;s office, we did find one instance of Napolitano saying “I believe the border is secure.&#8221; It came during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aLopSx7NB8">news conference</a> in San Diego on Feb. 5, after she toured the border. She was asked directly by a reporter, &#8220;You believe the border is secure then, today?&#8221; (It starts at about the 8 minute mark.)</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Napolitano, Feb. 5</strong>: I believe the border is secure. I believe the border is a safe border. That’s not to say that everything is 100 percent. It would be unrealistic, and no one I think using common sense would say you eliminate all crime, all illegal immigration. There is no city in the United States that has no crime, and yet most people believe they live in a fairly safe city or safe city. So, you have to look at a number of different things. Our commitment is to continue to invest, as we have been, to do it in a planned way, to do it in a way that emphasizes efforts at the border, emphasizes efforts in the interior of the country on more effective enforcement in the interior, more effective operation against employers who create the demand for a lot of illegal immigration, and we’re going to continue that. But I got to tell you … we can only do so much without having an overhaul of the immigration system writ large.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though she once said &#8220;the border is secure,&#8221; Napolitano has repeatedly used variations of the claim that the border is &#8220;as secure as it&#8217;s ever been.&#8221; That&#8217;s different.</p>
<p>Labrador raises a legitimate issue about whether there ought to be security benchmarks that must be met before legalization of immigrants begins. Napolitano has cautioned against using &#8220;one thing as a so-called trigger.&#8221; But Labrador&#8217;s claim that Napolitano would argue  &#8220;nothing else needs to happen&#8221; contradicts her repeated public  statements that more border security ought to be part of an immigration  bill.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Guest Workers</strong></span></p>
<p>Labrador also told only part of the story when he cited the number of nonagricultural guest visas in the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113s744es/pdf/BILLS-113s744es.pdf">Senate bill</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Labrador, July 7:</strong> One of the problems  with the Senate bill that we haven&#8217;t talked about is that the non-ag  [sic] guest worker portion of the Senate bill &#8230; starts out at 20,000 guest  workers per year. Think about that. I&#8217;ve had some congressmen say, &#8216;Do  you mean 20,000 per county? 20,000 per state?&#8217; And it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s 20,000  non-ag [sic] guest workers per year for the entire United States. You&#8217;re not  going to cut back illegal immigration by only bringing 20,000 guest  workers to the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>Labrador is talking about the new W-Visa program in the bill, which   would allow a set number of guest-worker visas to foreign workers in  lesser-skilled,  nonagricultural occupations such as hospitality,  janitorial,  retail and construction.</p>
<p>Labrador is correct that the number of W-Visas issued in the first  year under the Senate bill would be 20,000. But the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:SN00744:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp;">number quickly ramps  up to</a> 75,000 by the fourth year, and could go as high as 200,000 in  subsequent years.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>S. 744 Bill Summary:</strong> Limits the number of registered positions that may be approved each  year  to: (1) 20,000 for the first year (to begin on April 1, 2015, and  end  on March 31, 2016, unless the Secretary determines that the first  year  shall begin on October 1, 2015, and end on September 30, 2016);  (2)  35,000 for the second year; (3) 55,000 for the third year; and (4)   75,000 for the fourth year.</p></blockquote>
<p>The number of W-Visas issued in subsequent years would be determined  by a formula that takes into account such factors as  unemployment rates and occupational shortcomings. After the fourth year, the number could be as  high as 200,000 and as low as 20,000 in any given year.</p>
<p>The caps came about as a result of negotiations with union and  business leaders. Labrador&#8217;s concern about the low number of W-Visas is <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100652415">shared</a> by a number of people in the business community. Sen. Pat Toomey of  Pennsylvania unsuccessfully proposed an amendment that would have taken  the cap on the number of W-Visas up to 200,000 in the first year; and up  to 350,000 by the fourth year. (See <a href="http://beta.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4730-2">page 4738</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do not raise the caps for the low-skilled workers who want to  come to this country, then the next wave of illegal immigration is  guaranteed regardless of what we do at the border,&#8221; Toomey said when he  introduced the amendment.</p>
<p>We take no position on the appropriate number of W-Visas. But when  Labrador says the number starts at 20,000, he doesn&#8217;t give the full picture.</p>

<p>That claim &#8212; appearing on the conservative GOPUSA site &#8212; is far from true.</p>
<p>The number of adults &#8220;actually working&#8221; was just under 136 million in April, according to the most recent figures from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/data/#employment">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. And the number of adults &#8212; and children &#8212; getting any form of federal food assistance was put at 101 million by <a href="http://www.usda.gov/oig/webdocs/27001-0001-10.pdf">a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Inspector General</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, the GOPUSA headline is off by 35 million people. It&#8217;s also a false apples-to-fruit-salad comparison and a fallacious dichotomy as well, as we&#8217;ll show in a moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Savings Issue Ignored</span></strong></p>
<p>To be sure, the expansion of food-aid programs and their costs raises a legitimate issue, especially in times of historically massive budget deficits. That 101 million figure is a large one &#8212; just under one in three <a href="http://www.census.gov/popclock/">U.S. residents</a>. Furthermore, the Inspector General&#8217;s report, <a href="http://www.usda.gov/oig/index.htm">released July 3</a>, concluded that the federal government &#8220;could potentially achieve cost savings&#8221; by eliminating duplication and overlap in its 15 nutrition assistance programs, which the IG said were budgeted at $114 billion in fiscal year 2012.</p>
<p>But the federal <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/">Food and Nutrition Service</a> balked, saying a study of the issue would &#8220;divert limited resources away from other pressing issues of greater policy relevance.&#8221; It agreed only to come up by Sept. 30 with an estimate of what such a study would cost, and how to go about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Twisting Facts into Falsehood</span></strong></p>
<p>But rather than admonish the Obama administration for resisting an opportunity to reduce deficits by streamlining possibly duplicative food-aid programs, some partisan sites are making false comparisons between workers and food-aid beneficiaries.</p>
<p>For example, the GOPUSA item is actually a <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/101m-get-food-aid-federal-gov-t-outnumber-full-time-private-sector-workers">recycling of an earlier item</a> posted by CNSNews.com, another conservative site. The headline: &#8220;101M Get Food Aid from Federal Gov’t; Outnumber Full-Time Private Sector Workers&#8221;</p>
<p>The CNS item is a bit closer to being accurate, but misleads and exaggerates in multiple ways.</p>
<p>First, note that it compares those receiving federal food aid with &#8220;full-time, private sector&#8221; workers &#8212; leaving out millions of full-time government workers and millions more who are working part time, usually by choice. Second, as the story makes clear, the number of workers is an average for all of 2012, and thus is months out of date.</p>
<p>Unlike the GOPUSA item, the CNS story is literally true &#8212; as far as it goes. According to <a href="http://factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2013/07/BLS-2012-Full-Time-vs-Part-Time.pdf">figures that BLS supplies on request</a>, but doesn&#8217;t routinely publish on its website, the so-called <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/">household survey</a> found that an average of 142,469,000 were employed during calendar year 2012.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>A FactCheck.org technical note:</strong> The BLS household survey produces larger total employment figures than the more authoritative and much larger <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ces/">payroll survey</a> we cited earlier, and which nearly all economists use as the standard gauge for total employment. One reason for the discrepancy is that the household survey counts self-employed persons. But the payroll survey does not break down jobs by full or part time, so we will rely for the remainder of our critique on the same household survey figures cited by CNS and GOPUSA.</p></blockquote>
<p>That 142 million figure for total employment is far more than the estimated 101 million who receive any form of federal food aid, of course. But the CNS story first subtracts all of the 27,661,000 who worked part time (mostly by choice), and then subtracted 17,629,000 full-time government workers (mostly state and local workers including teachers, police, firefighters and such). That got its comparison number down to 97,180,000 &#8220;full time, private sector&#8221; workers.</p>
<p>That was accurate for 2012, but the <a href="http://factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2013/07/BLS-June-2013-Full-Time-vs-Part-Time.pdf">most recent household survey figures for June 2013</a> provide a less dramatic contrast. They show that 144,841,000 people were employed, full time or part time. Subtracting 27,442,000 part-time workers and 17,152,000 full-time government workers gets the number down to 100,247,000 &#8212; not too far below the estimated 101 million receiving some form of federal food aid.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Apples to Fruit Salad<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The comparison is deceptive not only because it omits millions of productively employed government and part-time workers, but also because it compares adult workers to the total food-aid population, which is largely made up of children (and some who are elderly). That&#8217;s not quite comparing apples to oranges, but it is like comparing apples to a fruit salad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Children made up 45 percent of people receiving food stamps, according to <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/ora/menu/Published/snap/FILES/Participation/2011CharacteristicsSummary.pdf">the most recent annual report</a> issued by the USDA in November 2012. An additional 9 percent were over age 60. The program is now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP and is the largest of the food-aid programs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And of course, the<a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/36slmonthly.htm"> national school lunch program</a>, which serves nearly 31 million, goes by definition to schoolchildren. The same goes for the smaller <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/35sbmonthly.htm">school breakfast program</a>, which serves more than 13 million children.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These food-aid programs overlap (which was the point of the IG report), so we can&#8217;t say for certain how many of the estimated 101 million on one or more food-aid programs are children, or who are beyond normal working age. The IG&#8217;s report doesn&#8217;t provide that detail. But it&#8217;s clear the number is a large one, and the comparison of children and elderly to working-age adults is inappropriate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">False Dilemma</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The comparison also sets up a common logical fallacy &#8212; the <a href="http://www.philosophy-index.com/logic/fallacies/false-dilemma.php">false dilemma</a> or false dichotomy. The fact is, millions of those who receive food aid are also working at low-wage jobs. The two categories are not, as the comparison suggests, mutually exclusive.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The IG report doesn&#8217;t specify how many food-aid recipients are employed. However, <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/ora/menu/Published/snap/FILES/Participation/2011CharacteristicsSummary.pdf">the  USDA&#8217;s annual report</a> states that over 30 percent of all households receiving SNAP benefits (food stamps) had some earnings in 2011. Furthermore, 41 percent of the people getting those benefits lived in a household with some earnings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Either way, the idea that people either work or get food aid is a false one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Careless Error<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The GOPUSA headline that first caught our eye further twisted the facts beyond the breaking point, and was simply and grossly false as we noted at the outset.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The story itself is also false, actually misquoting the original CNS story. It says more people are now getting food aid &#8220;than are working in the private sector,&#8221; which is not correct. The author who cribbed this partisan claim from CNS carelessly failed to specify &#8220;full time&#8221; workers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In fact, according to the June figures from the BLS household survey, more than 125 million people were working in nongovernment jobs in June, either full or part time. So both the story and its headline get it wrong. Both the original CNS story and the carelessly lifted GOPUSA story amount to food-aid foolery designed more to inflame partisan biases than to inform.</p>

<p>So, the target for <a href="http://factcheck.org/2011/09/patriot-majority-usa/">Patriot Majority</a> and Senate Majority PAC is new; the tactics, not so much. In fact, as Glenn Kessler, the <em>Washington Post</em>&#8216;s Fact Checker, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/4-pinocchios-for-the-latest-mediscare-ad/2013/06/27/d1d218ec-df6f-11e2-963a-72d740e88c12_blog.html">said</a> in writing about this ad, all three major fact-checking organizations (<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2012/07/no-end-to-end-medicare-claim/">FactCheck.org</a>, <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/23/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-paul-ryans-medicare-plan-coul/">PolitiFact.com</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/romneys-medicare-plan-obamas-use-of-out-of-date-data/2012/07/23/gJQAZ2yE5W_blog.html">The Fact Checker</a>) have previously debunked these claims.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe style="width: 500px; height:300px;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="http://video.factcheck.org/play/3dc6881b8ea"></iframe></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the claim that Cotton was &#8220;voting Congress taxpayer-funded health care for life.&#8221; Actually, Cotton <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h154">cosponsored and voted for</a> a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which requires members of Congress and their staffs to get health insurance through the exchanges created by the law. If the ACA were to be repealed, members of Congress and their staffs would continue to get their health insurance through the <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2009/08/health-care-for-members-of-congress/">Federal Employees Health Benefits Program</a>, an exchange-like program that offers a choice of many private plans to more than 8 million federal employees and retirees.</p>
<p>In other words, one impact of repealing the law would be that Congress would continue getting health insurance from the FEHB program, which <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42741.pdf">was created in 1959</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that federal government retirees <a href="http://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/Guide-Me/Retirees-Survivors/Health/Am-I-eligible/#url=Health">can continue to receive insurance</a> through the FEHB program as long as they&#8217;re eligible for an immediate annuity and were enrolled in the program for at least five years before retirement. And the government pays a good chunk of federal employees&#8217; premiums: an average of 72 percent. It&#8217;s largely &#8220;taxpayer-funded,&#8221; just as most work-based coverage is largely employer-funded. But that&#8217;s expected to still be the case once members start getting insurance through the exchanges. There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2013/05/congress-and-an-exemption-from-obamacare/">concern</a> on Capitol Hill that the transition won&#8217;t be that smooth, but congressional staffs are expected to get the same benefits, simply from a different insurance source.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Medicare Memories</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As we mentioned, nearly one year ago, we <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2012/07/no-end-to-end-medicare-claim/">fact-checked</a> the claims that lawmakers supported a plan to &#8220;end Medicare&#8221; that would have cost seniors an additional $6,000. (And the claims were old even then &#8212; the &#8220;end Medicare&#8221; claim made our &#8220;<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2011/12/the-whoppers-of-2011/">Whoppers of 2011</a>&#8221; list.) The reference is to the budget plan from Rep. Paul Ryan &#8212; but the &#8220;end Medicare&#8221; quote is taken out of context, and the $6,000 claim pertains to his plan from 2011. That was before Cotton was even elected.</p>
<p>The ad says Cotton was &#8220;supporting a plan that the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> said essentially ends Medicare,&#8221; as the phrase &#8220;essentially end Medicare&#8221; and a citation for the <em>Journal</em> pops up on screen. But the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703806304576240751124518520.html">April 4, 2011, article</a> said that Ryan&#8217;s plan would “essentially end Medicare … as a program that directly pays those bills.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Wall Street Journal, April 4, 2011:</strong> The plan would essentially end Medicare, which now pays most of the health-care bills for 48 million elderly and disabled Americans, as a program that directly pays those bills.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s not the same as saying Ryan&#8217;s plan would put an end to a government plan for health insurance for seniors. His plan would have been a big change: He called for a &#8220;premium-support&#8221; system, where the government would send payments, like subsidies, to private insurance companies that would compete for seniors&#8217; business on a Medicare exchange. He proposed implementing such a system for new beneficiaries beginning a decade in the future. The government would be paying insurance carriers, rather than directly paying health care bills.</p>
<p>While the Democratic claims haven&#8217;t changed in two years, Ryan&#8217;s plan has. His latest plans called for traditional Medicare to remain an option on his Medicare exchange.</p>
<p>As for the claim about some seniors paying thousands more under the Ryan plan, CBO did find, for the 2011 plan, that seniors with private plans would pay more than they would under the traditional Medicare system, and its analysis indicated that in 2022, a 65-year-old would pay about $6,000 more. The subsidies under that plan were set to increase with the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>But Ryan’s subsequent plans upped the rate of increase. CBO has only said of the latest plan that “beneficiaries might face higher costs,” but there was no more definitive estimate than that. Patriot Majority, however, hasn’t updated its attacks. It offers the same distortion it pushed a year ago.</p>
<p>The plan Ryan introduced in <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/12/news/economy/paul-ryan-budget/index.html">2013</a>, and the one Cotton <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h88">voted</a> in favor of, echoes his 2012 plan. The groups behind the ad point to a <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcottonAR/status/147467969822330880">Dec. 15, 2011, tweet</a> that Cotton sent from his personal account supporting Ryan&#8217;s Medicare plan: &#8220;Medicare needs reform, and @RepPaulRyan has a bipartisan plan to fix it: http://bit.ly/sBZnL4. #ar4 #argop #tcot.&#8221; But that&#8217;s a reference to the plan Ryan was about to introduce in 2012, as evidenced by the link to a <em><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/285837/another-step-toward-medicare-reform-yuval-levin">National Review</a></em> article on that topic.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping there&#8217;s no Groundhog Day in the summer of 2014.</p>

<li>Obama said that &#8220;since 2006, no country on Earth has reduced its total carbon pollution by as much as the United States of America.&#8221; That&#8217;s accurate in terms of the amount of emissions reduced. But dozens of nations have reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by a larger percentage than the U.S., which is second only to China in total emissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The president gave a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/25/remarks-president-climate-change">major speech</a> on climate change on June 25, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/politics/obama-plan-to-cut-greenhouse-gases.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">outlining a broad plan</a> to use his executive powers to reduce greenhouse gases. A day later, House Republican leaders &#8212; including Cantor, the <a href="http://majorityleader.gov/">House majority leader</a> &#8212; held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLzAMnn_tduD_ZIfD-mldm-8gECTdDfyfF&amp;v=qpdlrVtAmW8&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=2337">press conference</a> to denounce the potential economic impact of the plan.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Cantor, June 26:</strong> Increasingly, the  American people are losing trust in their government and losing faith in  their economy, and these are the problems that House Republicans are  trying to address and trying to fix. But &#8230;  yesterday, the president took time out to announce that he will  unilaterally introduce new rules and regulations that will impose higher  energy costs on our small businesses and our working families,  depressing growth in our economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cantor ignores the <a href="http://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm">most recent results from the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.conference-board.org/about/index.cfm?id=1980">Conference Board</a>, an independent economic research organization founded in 1916, produces monthly reports that are closely watched by businesses and economists and widely reported by business media. The board released its June report a day before the GOP press conference. The results were positive, with the index increasing to 81.4 from 74.3 in May:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, June 25:</strong> Consumer Confidence increased for the third consecutive month and is   now at its highest level since January 2008 (Index 87.3). Consumers are    considerably more positive about current business and labor market    conditions than they were at the beginning of the year. Expectations    have also improved considerably over the past several months, suggesting    that the pace of growth is unlikely to slow in the short-term, and  may   even moderately pick up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Days before the release of the most recent CCI, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke cited &#8220;increases in consumer confidence&#8221; as a reason that the Fed may start to slow its bond buying program &#8212; an announcement that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2013/06/20/ben-bernankes-lead-foot-drives-markets-down/">immediately</a> drove down the markets. <em>Canadian Business </em>magazine <a href="http://www.canadianbusiness.com/blogs-and-comment/bernanke-presser/">reported</a> that Bernanke &#8220;returned to that theme&#8221; &#8212; of consumer confidence &#8212; &#8220;several times&#8221; in his <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20130619.pdf">June 19 press conference</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Canadian Business, June 19</strong>: The chairman returned to that theme several times again during Wednesday’s press conference. He cited the latest reading on the University of Michigan Survey of Consumer Sentiment, which showed that Americans haven’t felt so good since July 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>We contacted Cantor’s office for data supporting his statement. His spokeswoman, <a href="http://majorityleader.gov/newsroom/2010/03/cantor-names-megan-whittemore-deputy-press-secretary.html">Megan Whittemoore</a>, directed us to the <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/163115/economic-confidence-edges-downward.aspx">June 18</a> Gallup Economic Confidence Index (a weekly poll) and the June 26 <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/indexes/rasmussen_consumer_index/rasmussen_consumer_index">Rasmussen Consumer Index</a> (a daily survey). The Rasmussen Consumer Index, as of June 26, was 100.4 &#8212; a drop of  11 points from a six-year high of 111.3 recorded on June 19. Gallup&#8217;s June 18 report showed a dip of two points, from -7 to -9, from the previous week. The <a href="http://factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2013/06/Gallup-Report-June-25.pdf">most recent Gallup report</a>,  which was published June 25, showed economic confidence edged up 1 point  from the report Whittemoore cited.</p>
<p>Both the June 25 Gallup report and the <a href="http://factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2013/06/Rasmussen.pdf">June 26 Rasmussen Consumer Index report</a> noted  that consumer confidence remains relatively high. Rasmussen said it remained &#8220;unchanged from three months ago,” despite the recent dip. Gallup reported, “Confidence remains on the higher end of what Gallup has measured the last five years,” as is partly illustrated in the chart below that was included in Gallup&#8217;s recent report.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-77519" href="http://factcheck.org/?attachment_id=77519/"><img title="gallup economic confidence" src="http://factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2013/06/gallup-economic-confidence1.png" alt="Gallup Economic Confidence ratings, 2011-2013" width="565" height="278" /></a></p>
<p>Despite improvements,  the surveys do show that most Americans are not    optimistic about the economy.  Negative Gallup scores &#8220;indicate   Americans  are more negative than  positive&#8221; about the economy. That&#8217;s true, too, of the Conference Board Consumer Confidence  Index, which showed more consumers believe business conditions are &#8220;bad&#8221; than &#8220;good.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Conference Board, June 25</strong>: Consumers’ assessment of current conditions continued to improve in  June. Those stating business conditions are “good” held steady at 19.1  percent, while those saying business conditions are “bad” decreased to  24.9 percent from 26.0 percent. Consumers’ appraisal of the job market  was also more positive. Those claiming jobs are “plentiful” increased to  11.7 percent from 9.9 percent, while those claiming jobs are “hard to  get” edged up to 36.9 percent from 36.4 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, data from multiple sources suggest consumers feel the economy is not good, but getting better &#8212; contrary to Cantor&#8217;s claim that &#8220;increasingly&#8221; Americans are &#8220;losing faith in  their economy.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>U.S. Leader in CO2 Reductions?</strong></span></p>
<p>In the speech that triggered Cantor&#8217;s remarks, Obama did some spinning of his own.</p>
<p>The president&#8217;s remark that &#8220;no country on Earth has reduced its   total carbon pollution by as much as the United States of America&#8221;   since 2006 is supported by a <a href="http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/news/2012/may/name,27216,en.html">May 2012 news release from the International Energy Agency</a> on global carbon dioxide emissions in 2011. While global emissions edged up, U.S. emissions went down.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>IEA, May 24, 2012: </strong>CO2  emissions in the  United States in 2011 fell by 92 Mt, or 1.7%,  primarily due to ongoing  switching from coal to natural gas in power  generation and an  exceptionally mild winter, which reduced the demand  for space heating.  US emissions have now fallen by 430 Mt (7.7%) since  2006, the largest  reduction of all countries or regions.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, it should be noted that there are few countries that even come  close to  emitting the amount of carbon dioxide that the U.S. does. The results  are  different when the reduction amount is calculated as a percentage.</p>
<p>In 2011, the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=90&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=8">U.S. emitted 5,490.63 million metric tons of carbon dioxide</a>.   That was second only to China, which emitted 8,715.31 million metric   tons. In fact, the U.S. carbon dioxide emissions reduction of over 430 million   metric tons since 2006 is more than most countries emit in a single   year. Only 14 countries, including the U.S. and China, emitted more than   that amount of carbon dioxide in 2011.</p>
<p>The U.S. wouldn&#8217;t be tops if emissions reductions were measured by the percentage change.</p>
<p>The U.S. reduced its CO2 emissions by 7.32 percent from 2006 to 2011, <a href="http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=90&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=8&amp;cid=regions&amp;syid=2006&amp;eyid=2011&amp;unit=MMTCD">according to the most recent data</a> from the Energy Information Administration. The <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=7890">EIA cited</a> &#8220;slower economic growth, weather,&#8221; higher gasoline prices and an increasing shift from coal to natural gas as reasons for the emissions decline in 2011.</p>
<p>But more than 40 nations   had a larger percentage reduction than the U.S., including France (10.10   percent), Germany (12.01 percent), Italy (14.24 percent), Spain (14.41   percent) and the United Kingdom (15.15 percent) &#8212; all of which <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/brief/eu/index_en.htm">committed to reducing emissions</a> under the <a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php">Kyoto Protocol</a> that took effect in 2005 and has <a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php">since been extended through 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6805">EU-15</a> countries &#8212; the 15 countries that were members of the European Union before 2004 &#8212; were &#8220;committed to reducing their collective emissions to 8% below 1990 levels by the years 2008-2012,&#8221; the EU says on its <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/brief/eu/index_en.htm">&#8220;climate action&#8221; website</a>. The United States <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/science/earth/28climate.html?ref=kyotoprotocol">did not ratify</a> the treaty.</p>
<p>The nation with the   largest reduction as a percentage since 2006 is the Republic of   Tajikistan, which reduced its emissions by 64.71 percent. Its emissions   dropped from 7.418 million metric tons in 2006 to 2.618 million metric   tons in 2011.</p>

<p>The Senate Conservatives Fund is a political action committee dedicated to electing conservative politicians to the U.S. Senate. It is allied with former Republican Sen. Jim DeMint, who now heads the conservative Heritage Foundation. Although conservative, the group is not averse to taking on Republicans, as <a href="http://www.senateconservatives.com/site/about">its website</a> makes clear: &#8220;We do not support liberal Republicans and we&#8217;re not affiliated with the Republican Party or any of its campaign committees.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Senate Conservatives Fund email</strong>: As you may know, Senator McConnell has negotiated three deals with President Obama this year that:</p>

<p>McConnell has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO3rPVSxABw">repeatedly</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKr1i2z5jlw">stated</a> his opposition to the health care law and his desire to see it repealed &#8220;<a href="http://www.mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=b24bb135-fc72-4736-b96f-0920149c03c9">in its entirety, root and branch</a>.&#8221; Still, the Senate Conservatives Fund <a href="http://www.senateconservatives.com/site/post/2141/three-obama-mcconnell-deals">cites</a> McConnell&#8217;s <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00044">vote in March</a> for the &#8220;<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr933enr/pdf/BILLS-113hr933enr.pdf">Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act</a>&#8221; as evidence that McConnell &#8220;[f]unded the implementation of Obamacare.&#8221; The bill &#8212; commonly known as a continuing budget resolution &#8212; <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/senate-deal-on-continuing-resolution-government-shutdown-89131.html">avoided a government shutdown</a> by providing funding for six more months.</p>
<p>The continuing resolution funded the entire federal government &#8212; including the Department of  Health and Human Services, the agency primarily responsible for  overseeing the Affordable Care Act. However, the bill also extended a 0.189 percent  across-the-board rescission (see page 216) in the department&#8217;s budget. It  also cut funding for some ACA-specific programs (see page 228), including $200  million from the Community-Based Care Transitions Program and $10  million from the Independent Payment Advisory Board.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the resolution <a href="http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/?p=17657">denied</a> the $949 million requested by the White House Office of Management and Budget to  help the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services establish new  federal health insurance exchanges, as well as $29 million <a href="http://www.cms.gov/about-cms/agency-information/performancebudget/downloads/cmsfy13cj-.pdf">requested by CMS</a> (see page 6) for health care fraud and abuse control. The denial of the federal exchange funding was initiated in the House, and according to <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/hhs-seeks-obamacare-funds-budget-2014-89915.html"><em>Politico</em></a>, &#8220;the Democratic-led Senate didn’t push the issue&#8221; &#8212; leaving that and other cuts in place.</p>
<p>Also, McConnell had earlier <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00034">voted in favor</a> of Sen. Ted Cruz&#8217;s <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:SP30:">amendment</a><a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d113:6:./temp/~bdFFb9::"> </a>to that very same bill that would have &#8220;prohibit[ed] the use of funds to carry out the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.&#8221; The amendment failed by a 45-52 vote.</p>
<p>As for the claim that McConnell &#8220;raised taxes on 80% of Americans,&#8221; it&#8217;s true that <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=3752&amp;DocTypeID=2">about 77 percent</a> of Americans saw their taxes go up in 2013. However, this was largely  due to the previously scheduled expiration of a temporary payroll tax  cut.</p>
<p>In 2010, Congress <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/07/AR2010120707257.html">reduced</a> a payroll tax that workers pay on income up to $106,800 from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent for 2011. The payroll tax &#8220;holiday&#8221; &#8212; championed by Obama &#8212; was billed as a temporary measure to goose a failing economy. It was extended for an additional year with bipartisan support. The Senate <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00232">voted 89-10</a> on Dec. 17, 2011, to extend the payroll tax holiday for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/us/politics/extension-of-payroll-tax-cut-passes-senate.html">the first two months of 2012</a> and then on Feb. 17, 2012, <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00022">voted 60-36</a> to extend it for the remainder of the year. McConnell voted for the extension both times.</p>
<p>However, by the end of that year, with the provision again set to expire,<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/dec/9/little-interest-in-renewing-payroll-tax-holiday/?page=all"> there proved little interest</a> in Congress in extending it. As a result, the temporary tax cut was left out of the fiscal cliff  deal and was allowed to expire.</p>
<p>Even Grover Norquist &#8212; president of the conservative Americans for Tax Reform &#8212; <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/norquist-says-payroll-tax-cut-expiration-isn-t-a-tax-hike-20111201">said</a> he did not consider a legislator who allowed the payroll tax cut to expire to be in violation of the group&#8217;s <a href="http://www.atr.org/taxpayer-protection-pledge">pledge</a> against raising taxes. <a href="http://www.atr.org/payroll-tax-holiday-temporary-beginning-a6685">Norquist said</a> it was &#8220;always a temporary measure.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Americans for Tax Reform, Jan. 13, 2012</strong>: Because it was always a temporary measure, opposition to this extension cannot fairly be called support for a tax increase.</p></blockquote>
<p>As for the claim that McConnell worked with Obama to suspend the debt ceiling &#8220;this year,&#8221; the Senate Conservatives Fund acknowledges it goofed on the date. The group said it meant to refer to a <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00123">debt limit increase</a> that McConnell negotiated with Obama in 2011. Earlier this year, McConnell <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00011">voted against</a> the &#8220;No Budget, No Pay Act,&#8221; which temporarily suspended the debt limit.</p>

That may be true over the next decade, but the CBO&#8217;s conclusion was just the opposite for the long term. Moreover, the CBO said it is not clear whether the bill would negatively impact most <em>current </em>American workers even in the short term.</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office released two reports on the so-called Gang of Eight Senate bill, the <a href="http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=285276e0-9fe6-4914-a3b2-cac1e0c2c505">Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act:</a> one, a <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/s744.pdf">cost estimate</a> of the bill; the other, an assessment of its <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/44346">economic impact</a>. With the reports dropping on June 18, both opponents and proponents took to the Sunday political shows citing various aspects of the reports to bolster their cases.</p>
<p>While there is plenty of fodder in the CBO reports for both sides on  issues related to the bill&#8217;s impact on deficits and  reducing illegal immigration, we are taking a closer look at claims by  Republican Sens. Mike Lee and Jeff Sessions &#8212; both opponents of the  Senate bill &#8212; regarding the CBO&#8217;s findings about the impact on  unemployment and wages.</p>
<p>Sessions also claimed that the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, in addition to the CBO, has said that the Senate bill would “impact all Americans that are out there   working today adversely.” But the Atlanta Fed didn&#8217;t say that, and it didn&#8217;t study the impact of the bill. To the contrary, a 2008 paper by two Atlanta Fed researchers concluded that &#8220;changing the legal status  of undocumented workers&#8221; would &#8220;forestall the negative impact&#8221; of illegal immigration on the wages of U.S. workers in industries that employ &#8220;undocumented workers.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Wages and Unemployment</strong></span></p>
<p>On &#8220;<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2013/06/23/sens-graham-lee-talk-edward-snowden-gop#p//v/2501662510001">Fox News Sunday</a>&#8221; on June 23, Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, said, &#8220;We have to remember at the end of the day, that CBO told us early this week that this will be bad for wages. It will be bad for unemployment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those sentiments were echoed by Sen. Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama, who said on CBS&#8217; &#8220;<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2102-3460_162-57590621.html">Face the Nation</a>&#8220;: &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have lower wages and higher unemployment according to the CBO analysis of this bill. Why would any member of Congress want to vote for a bill at a time of high unemployment, falling wages, to bring in a huge surge of new labor that can only hurt the poorest among us the most?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that in its <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/44346">study on the economic impact</a> of the proposed Senate bill, the CBO concluded that &#8220;temporary imbalances in the skills and occupations demanded and supplied in the labor market, as well as other factors, would cause the unemployment rate to be slightly higher for several years than projected under current law.&#8221; The CBO concluded that average wages also would dip slightly over the next decade.</p>
<p>But eventually, the report said, average wages would increase, by 2025 and in the years after, compared with what they would be under current law.</p>
<p>As CBO Director Doug Elmendorf explained in a June 18 memo:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Elmendorf, June 18</strong>: CBO’s central estimates also show that average wages for the entire labor force would be 0.1 percent <em>lower </em>in 2023 and 0.5 percent <em>higher </em>in 2033 under the legislation than under current law. Average wages would be slightly lower than under current law through 2024, primarily because the amount of capital available to workers would not increase as rapidly as the number of workers and because the new workers would be less skilled and have lower wages, on average, than the labor force under current law. However, the rate of return on capital would be higher under the legislation than under current law throughout the next two decades.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not all workers would feel the effects equally, the CBO added. In the short-term, those with lower and higher average skills would experience a slight overall decrease in wages.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>CBO, June 18</strong>: The legislation would particularly increase the number of workers with lower or higher skills but would have less effect on the number of workers with average skills. As a result, the wages of lower- and higher-skilled workers would tend to be pushed downward slightly (by less than ½ percent) relative to the wages of workers with average skills.</p></blockquote>
<p>Elmendorf went on to explain that even the short-term pain may not be felt by current U.S. residents. That&#8217;s because CBO&#8217;s estimates looked at the effect on wages and unemployment for <em>all</em> U.S. workers under the bill, including those afforded a path to citizenship, not just current U.S. residents. So, Elmendorf wrote, even though average wages would dip slightly in the first 10 years, that does &#8220;not necessarily imply that current U.S. residents would be worse off.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Elmendorf, June 18</strong>: The estimated reductions in average wages and per capita GNP for much of the next two decades do not necessarily imply that current U.S. residents would be worse off, on average, under the legislation than they would be under current law. Both of those figures represent differences between the averages for all U.S. residents under the legislation—including both the people who would be residents under current law and the additional people who would come to the country under the legislation—and the averages under current law for people who would be residents in the absence of the legislation. As noted, the additional people who would become residents under the legislation would earn lower wages, on average, than other residents, which would pull down the average wage and per capita GNP; at the same time, the income earned by capital would increase. CBO has not analyzed the full economic effects of the legislation separately for the incomes of people who would be U.S. residents under current law.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sessions&#8217; warning about lower wages and higher unemployment was framed in the context of currently high rates  of unemployment and falling wages, and so the short term impact is a  legitimate issue. However, by failing to also mention the longer-term impact projected in the report, both Sessions and Lee are only telling part of the story.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>The Federal Reserve and Harvard Economists</strong></span></p>
<p>Sessions also claimed on &#8220;<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2102-3460_162-57590621.html">Face the Nation</a>&#8221;  that CBO, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and “Harvard economists”  all said the Senate bill would “impact all Americans that are out there  working today adversely.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Sessions, June 23</strong>: I really believe that  the numbers in the bill, the lack of enforcement effectiveness in the  bill, puts us in a position where it will impact all Americans that are  out there working today adversely. And the CBO has said that. The  Federal Reserve in Atlanta has said that. Harvard economists have said  that. There&#8217;s really little doubt about that.</p></blockquote>
<p>As we&#8217;ve already explained, the CBO didn&#8217;t say the Senate bill would  negatively affect &#8220;all Americans that are out there working today.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta didn&#8217;t say that, either. Jean  Tate, a spokeswoman for the bank, told us &#8220;the Atlanta Fed has not  studied the impact of any particular legislation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sessions&#8217; office referred us to a <a href="http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/wp0807c.pdf">2008 working paper</a> titled &#8220;The Labor Market Experience and Impact of Undocumented Workers&#8221;  by Atlanta Fed researchers Julie Hotchkiss and Myriam Quispe-Agnoli.  The authors reviewed literature on the impact of illegal immigration on  the wages of U.S. citizens in industries that employ &#8220;undocumented  workers.&#8221; It said &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221; have “limited employment and  grievance opportunities” and, as a result, employers take advantage of  them &#8212; which drives down wages for documented workers in that same  industry.</p>
<p>The Fed paper said the impact on wages varied depending on job  skills. It cited a 2007 study, for example, that found the wages of  “native manual laborers” were 0.8 percent lower, but the impact on the  wages of professional occupations was “insignificant.”</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not all. In conclusion, Hotchkiss and Quispe-Agnoli  offered three options to “forestall the negative impact of a growing  number of undocumented workers” &#8212; including “changing the legal status  of undocumented workers. Extending to all immigrants the same employee  rights afforded documented workers would eliminate a primary source of  the measured downward wage pressure in industries that hire undocumented  workers.”</p>
<p>In other words, one way to improve the wages of U.S. workers in  industries that employ &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221; is to make them legal &#8212;  which is exactly what the Senate bill would do.</p>
<p>We pointed this out to Andrew Logan, a Republican staffer on the  Senate Budget Committee who referred us to the Atlanta Fed paper. (Sessions  is the <a href="http://www.budget.senate.gov/democratic/index.cfm/republicanmembers">ranking Republican</a> on the Budget Committee.)</p>
<p>In an email to us, Logan said that &#8220;the FRB [Federal Reserve Bank] paper  is just one component of a large body of academic research that looks at  labor markets and immigration.&#8221; True, but Sessions claimed that the  Atlanta Fed paper said something that it did not say.</p>
<p>Lastly, Sessions cited the work of <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/gborjas/biography.html">Harvard economist George Borjas</a> &#8212; although incorrectly in the plural as &#8220;Harvard economists&#8221; &#8212; in  making his case that all U.S. workers will be adversely affected by the  Senate bill. Sessions&#8217; office referred us to an <a href="http://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/borjas-economics.pdf">April article</a> Borjas wrote for the <a href="http://www.cis.org/About">Center for Immigration Studies</a>, a nonprofit that  advocates &#8220;low immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Borjas&#8217; paper concludes that while &#8220;the overall  net impact on the native-born is small, the loss or gain for particular  groups of the population can be substantial&#8221; &#8212; particularly for those  without high school diplomas.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Borjas</strong>: Classifying workers by education  level and age and comparing differences across groups over time shows  that a 10 percent increase in the size of an education/age group due to  the entry of immigrants (both legal and illegal) reduces the wage of  native-born men in that group by 3.7 percent and the wage of all  native-born workers by 2.5 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, Sessions accurately cited Borjas&#8217; work. But Sessions goes too far  when he concludes that the CBO, the Atlanta Fed and Borjas all show there is  &#8220;really little doubt&#8221; that all U.S. workers would be adversely affected  by the Senate bill. That is a debatable point &#8212; as Borjas himself  illustrates in his April article. Borjas&#8217; article reviews current  literature on the issue &#8212; including the work of economists Gianmarco  Ottaviano and Giovanni Peri, who have found that immigration has a  positive impact on the wages of most U.S. workers.</p>
<p>Borjas disagrees with Ottaviano and Peri, and rebuts their work in his article. But, as we have <a href="http://factcheck.org/2013/06/a-puffed-up-appeal-to-job-fears/">written before</a>, supporters of the Senate bill cite the economists&#8217; work that says immigration will increase U.S. employment and wages.</p>
<p>The official <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113srpt40/pdf/CRPT-113srpt40.pdf">Senate Judiciary Committee report</a> on the immigration bill cites the work of Ottaviano and Peri when it  says, &#8220;One recent study found that over the period from 1990 to 2006,  immigration increased average wages for native workers by 0.6 percent  and had essentially no effect or a positive effect on the wages of even  the least-educated U.S.-born workers.&#8221; But Ottaviano and Peri also found  that immigration has &#8220;a substantial negative effect (− 6.7%) on wages  of previous immigrants in the long run&#8221; &#8212; a point ignored in the Senate  report.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s our larger point: The facts cited by both sides in the immigration debate are not always what they seem.</p>

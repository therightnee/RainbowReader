<blockquote><p>June 27, 2013</p>
<p>Obama Requests 15,000 Russian Troops For “Upcoming” Disaster</p>
<p>By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers</p>
<p>An unsettling report prepared by the Emergencies Ministry (EMERCOM) circulating in the Kremlin today on the just completed talks between Russia and the United States in Washington D.C. says that the Obama regime has requested at least 15,000 Russian troops trained in disaster relief and “crowd functions” [i.e. riot control] be pre-positioned to respond to FEMA Region III during an unspecified “upcoming” disaster.</p>

<p>Important to note, this report says, is that FEMA Region III, the area Russian troops are being requested for, includes Washington D.C. and the surrounding States of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, “strongly suggesting” that the Obama regime has lost confidence in its own military being able to secure its survival should it be called upon to do so.</p>
<p>In his public statements, yesterday, regarding these matters Minister Puchkov stated, “We have decided that the US Federal Emergency Management Agency and Russia&#8217;s Emergencies Ministry will work together to develop systems to protect people and territory from cosmic impacts,” and further noted that his meeting with DHS Director Napolitano also covered other kinds of natural emergencies, such as recent years&#8217; extreme weather in both Russia and United States. </div></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; color: #800000;"><strong>FULL ANSWER</strong></span></p>
<p>This viral email is an excerpt of a <a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index1688.htm">June 27 article</a> posted on <a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/">Whatdoesitmean.com</a>, a news aggregate website known for publishing articles with sensational headlines and advancing conspiracy theories. The rumor quickly spread across the Internet from there.</p>
<p>The article twists the facts about a routine meeting between U.S. and Russian agencies to share information and expertise on emergency management situations such as earthquakes, floods, and acts of terrorism. It says &#8220;the Obama regime has requested at least 15,000 Russian troops trained in disaster relief and &#8216;crowd functions&#8217; [i.e. riot control] be pre-positioned to respond to FEMA Region III during an unspecified &#8216;upcoming&#8217; disaster.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.fema.gov/region-iii-dc-de-md-pa-va-wv">FEMA Region III includes</a> Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the source of that claim? The article links to a story from the <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20130626/181883790/FEMA-Russian-Ministry-to-Join-Forces-Against-Space-Threat.html">Russian news agency Ria Novosti</a>, but that story doesn&#8217;t mention a request or approval of 15,000 Russian troops to help protect the eastern United States during a disaster. Instead, it details a U.S.-Russia partnership “to improve protection against meteorites and other space threats.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Ria Novosti, June 26: </strong>Russia and the United States will work together to improve protection against meteorites and other space threats, Russia’s emergencies minister said on Tuesday following a joint Russia-US working group meeting in Washington.</p>
<p>“We have decided that the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Russia&#8217;s Emergencies Ministry will work together to develop systems to protect people and territory from cosmic impacts,” Russia’s Emergencies Minister Vladimir Puchkov told journalists.</p>
<p>The meeting also covered other kinds of natural emergencies, such as recent years&#8217; extreme weather in Russia and United States, but it was cooperation to counter space threats that stole the limelight at the news conference.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another highly cited article about Russian forces supposedly securing the U.S. was posted days later on <a href="http://www.infowars.com/">Infowars.com</a>, a site run by <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/alex-jones-day-life-libertarian-radio-host/story?id=10891854#.UdxU0W3Nnuk">libertarian radio host, author and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones</a>.</p>
<p>That <a href="http://www.infowars.com/russian-forces-to-provide-security-at-us-events/">July 1 article claims that</a> &#8220;Russian officials will provide &#8216;security at mass events&#8217; in the United States,&#8221; as part of a joint agreement signed between FEMA and the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry. &#8220;This suggests that events designated as &#8216;National Special Security Events,&#8217; by the Department of Homeland Security, which include the Super Bowl, international summits such as the G8 and presidential inaugurations, will now rely partly on Russian authorities to provide security,&#8221; the article says.</p>
<p>But that, too, distorts the recent Russia-U.S. meeting on emergency management practices. The article cites a <a href="http://en.mchs.ru/news/item/434203/">June 26 press release from the Russian government</a> about the renewal of a long-standing agreement between the two agencies to &#8220;exchange experts during joint rescue operations in major disasters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The press release, which was issued by the Ministry of the Russian Federation for Civil Defense, Emergencies and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disasters, said:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>EMERCOM of Russia: </strong>The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry and the USA Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are going to exchange experts during joint rescue operations in major disasters. This is provided by a protocol of the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission Working Group on Emergency Situations and seventeenth meeting of Joint U.S.-Russia Cooperation Committee on Emergency Situations, which took place in Washington on 25 June.</p>
<p>The document provides for expert cooperation in disaster response operations and to study the latest practices.</p>
<p>In addition, the parties approved of U.S.-Russian cooperation in this field in 2013-2014, which envisages exchange of experience including in monitoring and forecasting emergency situations, training of rescuers, development of mine-rescuing and provision of security at mass events.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting the parties expressed their satisfaction with the level of cooperation between the Russian Federation and the United States in the area of emergency prevention and response and agreed to develop it in order to respond efficiently to all kinds of disasters.</p></blockquote>
<p>There was no mention of exchanging military personnel, let alone 15,000 Russian troops. Rather, the U.S. and Russia, once again, agreed to exchange information among emergency experts in several areas, including &#8220;provision of security at mass events.&#8221; As was noted in the press release, the United States and Russia have been meeting for years to discuss the best ways to handle natural and man-made disasters.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>U.S.-Russia Partnership</strong></span></p>
<p>In 1996, the <a href="http://www.fema.gov/femas-international-programs-activities">U.S. and Russia signed a Memorandum of Understanding</a>, creating the Joint U.S.-Russia Cooperation Committee on Emergency Situations. And, in 2009, President Barack Obama and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, created the <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/eur/ci/rs/usrussiabilat/c37332.htm">U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission Working Group on Emergency Situations.</a></p>
<p>A FEMA spokesman told FactCheck.org that the June 25 meeting &#8212; which was the 17th for the Joint Committee on Emergency Situations and the 4th for the BPC Working Group on Emergency Situations &#8212; was merely a continuation of those long-standing partnerships.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be no exchange of security or military personnel through this agreement,&#8221; the spokesman said. &#8220;The agreement continues information-sharing meetings and observation opportunities with first responders and emergency managers.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the second meeting of the BPC in 2011, for example, it was agreed that &#8220;the Emergency Situations Working Group will explore collaboration and joint projects between FEMA, the U.S. Geological Survey, and EMERCOM to share best practices in the preparation of rescuers, to develop volunteer firefighting teams, and to map hazards associated with floods, droughts, wildfires, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions.&#8221; That is <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/eur/ci/rs/usrussiabilat/186831.htm#11">from the commission&#8217;s 2012 report</a>.</p>
<p>That report also said that, at the June 2011 meeting in Boston, &#8220;experts discussed a whole-community approach to disaster preparedness and response,&#8221; and that they &#8220;held a panel discussion on lessons learned from recent international disaster responses, including the Haiti earthquake of 2010 and the Japan earthquake and tsunami of 2011.&#8221;</p>
<p>In May 2010, at the <a href="http://m.state.gov/md144097.htm">14th meeting of the Cooperation Committee on Emergency Situations</a>, representatives outlined an agenda for areas to work on in the future, including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Exchange best practices in “mass event planning” to better ensure public safety at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Continue exchange programs between rescue services, emphasizing training methods for rescuers and equipment of staging areas;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Exchange experience on the creation, functioning and the development of national emergency management systems.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Continue to develop cooperation between Russian and American regional emergency response organizations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Exchange best practices in fire-extinguishing technology.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Improve operational information exchanges during planned humanitarian and disaster response efforts in third countries.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Exchange best practices in the functioning of emergency operations centers, at the local, regional and national levels.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Exchange best practices in addressing the needs of children in emergency situations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Exchange concepts and information on building disaster resistant communities and community resiliency.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Exchange best practices in Mass Transit Emergency Events.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Exchange best practices in medical aspects of emergency response.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These are examples of some of the things that the groups have committed to working on in past years. And none of them involve exchanging security or military personnel.</p>
<p>The agenda and signed protocol from the most recent meeting in 2013 are not available online. We have requested those documents from FEMA and the BPC Working Group on Emergency Situations. If we receive them, we will update this article.</p>

<p>Only those with full citizenship can vote in state and federal elections, and immigrants provided legal status through the Senate immigration plan couldn&#8217;t obtain full citizenship for at least 13 years. The president doesn&#8217;t have the power to unilaterally alter that.</p>
<p>Bachmann based her fantastical claim on another false premise, that Obama had done something similar in 2012 when he decided &#8220;anyone who was here as a Latina under age 30 &#8230; you get to vote.&#8221; In reality, Obama announced in 2012 that he would not seek to deport those under 31 who were brought to the U.S. as children by immigrant parents. His action had nothing to do with voting rights &#8212; and none were given.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with the conservative website <em><a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/07/only-you-can-stop-amnesty/">World Net Daily</a></em>, published on July 14, Bachmann warned that passing an immigration bill would be disastrous for Republicans in the 2014 elections and beyond.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bachmann, July 14</strong>: Contrary to popular opinion, Republicans won’t get patted on the back or get new votes because of passing amnesty. They’re going to get blamed. And it’s my prediction that the House Republicans could put themselves in a position where they could actually lose the gavel in 2014. <strong>Because I think the president even by executive order can again wave his magic wand before 2014 and he’d say, &#8220;Now all of the new legal Americans are going to have voting rights.&#8221; Why do I say that? He did it in 2012. Do you remember? Anyone who was here as a Latina under age 30. He said, &#8220;You get to vote.&#8221; What?!! He decides you get to vote? If he did it in 2012, know, take it to the bank, he’ll do it in 2014. </strong>And then guess what’ll happen? Democrat in the White House. Democrats controlling the Senate. Democrats controlling the House. At that point they will change election law. And it will be almost impossible to ever see a Republican majority again. Do we get how important this is? I’m not crying wolf here. This is the most important vote we are going to take in the next two years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Parts of her comments were reprinted in other mainstream media outlets such as the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/07/15/michele-bachmann-we-need-to-spank-the-president/"><em>Washington Post</em></a> and the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/michele-bachmann-obama-perpetual-magic-wand-nobodys-given-172120064.html"><em>National Journal</em></a>.</p>
<p>There are a lot of holes in Bachmann&#8217;s scenario. But we&#8217;ll start with the claim that in 2012, Obama decreed that &#8220;anyone who was here as a Latina under age 30. He said, ‘You get to vote.’ &#8221;</p>
<p>That never happened.</p>
<p>Rather, in June 2012, Obama&#8217;s Department of Homeland Security <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/news/2012/06/15/secretary-napolitano-announces-deferred-action-process-young-people-who-are-low">announced</a> that it would no longer deport people under 31 years of age who: came to the U.S. when they were younger than 16, have lived in the U.S. continuously for five years, are in school or have graduated high school, and have not been convicted of a felony or &#8220;significant misdemeanor offense.&#8221; Obama did not grant those immigrants citizenship, nor any citizenship rights, such as voting rights.</p>
<p>In his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/15/remarks-president-immigration">public remarks</a> about the new policy directive, Obama noted that it only provided that eligible immigrants could &#8220;request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Obama, June 15, 2012</strong>: Now, let&#8217;s be clear &#8212; this is not amnesty, this is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It&#8217;s not a permanent fix. This is a temporary stop-gap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people.</p></blockquote>
<p>The action had nothing to do with voting rights. It did <em>not</em> provide any kind of path to citizenship for immigrants who were brought to the country illegally by their parents. And it did not bestow the right to vote in state or federal elections, as Bachmann claimed.</p>
<p>Nor would Obama be able to grant voting rights to immigrants afforded legal status through an immigration bill such as that passed by the Senate &#8212; the <a href="http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=285276e0-9fe6-4914-a3b2-cac1e0c2c505">Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.</a> Under the Senate bill, many immigrants currently in the U.S. illegally will be able to apply for provisional status, and ultimately to apply for citizenship. The process from undocumented to provisional status to citizenship would take <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/special-reports/guide-s744-understanding-2013-senate-immigration-bill">at least</a> 13 years. Only then could they vote.</p>
<p>According to U.S. law, it is a federal offense for anyone who is not a legal U.S. citizen to vote in a federal election (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/611">18 USC 611</a>). It is also a federal offense for anyone to make a false statement to claim to be a citizen of the U.S. in order to register to vote or to vote in any federal, state or local election (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1015">18 USC 1015 (f)</a>). And if that wasn&#8217;t clear enough, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, a.k.a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/42usc/subch_ih.php">The Motor Voter Act</a>, spells out that it is a federal crime to provide false information when registering to vote. Every state requires that people be citizens in order to register to vote or to vote, and, therefore, immigrants who are not citizens would have to provide criminally false information in order to register to vote.</p>
<p>More important, Obama can&#8217;t wave any &#8220;magic wand&#8221; or issue an executive order to change that.</p>
<p>&#8220;That particular provision of the law can&#8217;t be waived by the president,&#8221; said <a href="http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/v/hans-von-spakovsky">Hans A. von Spakovsky</a>, a senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, which opposes any immigration bill that includes a path to citizenship. &#8220;The president can&#8217;t legitimize non-citizens registering to vote or voting because federal law prohibits that.&#8221;</p>
<p>A former Justice Department official and member of the Federal Election Commission, von Spakovsky worries, however, that the Obama administration will refuse to prosecute people who violate that law.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there is the will to enforce that,&#8221; he told us, and he expects the cases of immigrants illegally voting would only get worse if a path-to-citizenship immigration bill is passed. But that&#8217;s a separate issue from the one raised by Bachmann. Bachmann claimed that Obama would issue an executive order allowing newly legalized residents to vote in the 2014 election. And that&#8217;s just not possible. Despite Bachmann&#8217;s assurances that she was not crying wolf with her scenario, that&#8217;s exactly what she was doing.</p>

But he pointedly writes: “I’m not questioning here the existence of these programs.”</p>
<p>The Democratic Party of Virginia began airing the new ad, titled &#8220;Peggy,&#8221; July 14 in northern Virginia, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, a unit of Kantar Media. Peggy is a retiree who pans Cuccinelli&#8217;s policy positions in his new book, &#8220;<a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/book/220745/the-last-line-of-defense-by-ken-cuccinelli">The Last Line of Defense</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe style="width: 500px; height:300px;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="http://video.factcheck.org/play/a81affe0ade"></iframe>
<p>&#8220;In his book,&#8221; Peggy says, &#8220;Cuccinelli questions whether Medicare and Social Security should exist, and said people are dependent on government.&#8221; The ad displays &#8220;page 62&#8243; as the source of the first claim and &#8220;page 63&#8243; for the second.</p>
<p>There is no question that Cuccinelli writes that people are dependent on government programs. In a section subtitled &#8220;The Government is Not Benevolent,” he writes that &#8220;bad politicians&#8221; foster this dependency to amass power.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;The Last Line of Defense,&#8221; pages 62-63</strong>: Sometimes bad politicians set out to grow government in order to increase their own power and influence. This phenomenon doesn’t just happen in Washington; it happens at all levels of government. The amazing thing is that they often grow government without protest from citizens, and sometimes they even get buy-in from citizens – at least from the ones getting the goodies.</p>
<p>One of their favorite ways to increase their power is by creating programs that dispense subsidized government benefits, such as Medicare, Social Security, and outright welfare (Medicaid, food stamps, subsidized housing, and the like). These programs make people dependent on government. And once people are dependent, they feel they can’t afford to have the programs taken away, no matter how inefficient, poorly run, or costly to the rest of society.</p></blockquote>
<p>He blames Democrats and Republicans alike for dispensing &#8220;goodies&#8221; and growing the size of government. He specifically criticizes Medicare Part D &#8212; the prescription-drug benefit program that was enacted by President George W. Bush with overwhelmingly Republican support in the <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2003/roll332.xml">House</a> and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00459">Senate</a>.</p>
<p>However, on page 238, Cuccinelli says: &#8220;I&#8217;m not questioning here the existence of these programs,&#8221; when he writes about the cost of Social Security, Medicare and defense programs. This time, he is writing in the context of economic growth and benefits of private-sector spending compared with government spending.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;The Last Line of Defense,&#8221; pages 237-238</strong>: A simple example of how private-sector spending increases economic growth more than government spending does would be a business that smartly spends $100 and expects to earn that amount back plus a return on its investment, so it turns $100 into, let’s say, $115. That’s economic growth.</p>
<p>In contrast, despite how many times you may hear politicians talk about &#8220;investments&#8221; in government programs, government spends very little on what you could call &#8220;investments&#8221; that result in economic growth. For example, in 2011, the biggest programs in the federal government were Social Security (20 percent of the budget), national defense (20 percent), and Medicare (13.5 percent). There is no monetary return on these investments in any traditional business sense (that is, one invests money with a goal of getting a return in the form of interest, income or appreciation in value), although there are obviously other reasons America spends money on these programs.</p>
<p>I’m not questioning here the existence of these programs nor the wisdom of how much money is spent on them. What I’m trying to illustrate is that most dollars that government spends do not create economic growth but instead take money out of the hands of the people who do create economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cuccinelli clearly writes that people are dependent on government &#8212; just as the Democratic ad says. But it goes too far to say he &#8220;questions whether Medicare and Social Security should exist,&#8221; when in fact he writes he is &#8220;not questioning &#8230; the existence of these programs.&#8221;</p>

<p>We have redesigned our site for optimal viewing across all platforms, and we have switched to a larger Web hosting service to improve speed.</p>
<p>The most obvious change is our new look. We redesigned the site as a so-called <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.io/scrolldeck.js/decks/responsive/">responsive website.</a> It is called &#8220;responsive&#8221; because the website automatically adjusts to your device &#8212; tablet, smartphone, laptop or desktop &#8212; for optimal viewing. We flipped the switch on the new design today, but it may take a day or two for you to experience it.</p>
<p>Why did we change? We initially looked at creating apps for different mobile devices, but ultimately settled on a responsive website after researching industry trends and reviewing our options.</p>
<p>More and more readers are coming to our site through mobile devices &#8212; a trend that is certain to accelerate in the future. In a blog post titled &#8220;<a href="http://mashable.com/2012/12/11/responsive-web-design/">Why 2013 Is the Year of Responsive Web Design</a>,&#8221; Pete Cashmore, <a href="http://mashable.com/author/pete-cashmore/">founder and CEO of Mashable</a>, discusses the shift from personal computers to mobile devices. As he writes, &#8220;A million screens have bloomed, and we need to build for all of them.&#8221; The obvious solution is to build a single website that adjusts to all devices.</p>
<p>We think our new design looks great on a desktop, tablet or smartphone. We hope you agree, but if you have any questions or comments, please send them to us at editor@factcheck.org.</p>

Blunt said that applicants can lie about their income &#8212; &#8220;with no way to verify that&#8221; &#8212; when seeking federal subsidies to help buy health insurance. However, all applicants&#8217; income claims in 2014 will be checked against federal data, and &#8220;a statistically significant sample&#8221; of suspect applications will be subject to further income verification.</p>
<p>At a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfwFzY9qsZY">July 10 news conference</a> hosted by Senate Republicans critical of the health care law, Blunt claimed there would be no verification &#8212; and possibly no penalty &#8212; for lying to the government in an attempt to get tax credits to buy insurance on the soon-to-launched exchanges:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Blunt, July 10 (9:20 and 20:39 marks):</strong> And you know, the other thing, besides waiving the employer requirement, is they waived the income verification requirement. You all remember that up to 400 percent of poverty [level], you get some assistance in buying your individual insurance, but now you self-verify what your income is. There&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s a reasonable way to ask people to qualify for a new benefit, that you say what you think your income&#8217;s going to be with no way to verify that. &#8230;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no IRS check. There&#8217;s no &#8212; I don&#8217;t even know if there are any penalties if you verify wrong. You just say, &#8220;Well, I made $80,000 last year as a family,&#8221; which is about the cap, is around $80,000 or $90,000 for a family of four. You still get assistance at that level.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Missouri Republican goes way beyond the facts here. It&#8217;s simply not true that there&#8217;s &#8220;no way to verify&#8221; what applicants list as their income on tax credit applications. The insurance exchanges will compare all income figures with federal information, such as tax filings, and will ask for additional information if an applicant doesn&#8217;t have a previous tax filing.</p>
<p>Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which issued the rules on this, explained the process in a <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/blog/2013/07/myth-fact-marketplace.html">&#8220;myth vs. fact&#8221; post</a> on July 9:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Tavenner, July 9: </strong>No matter which type of Marketplace is operating in a state, the Marketplace will always check the income information submitted by individuals against electronic income data sources such as tax filings, Social Security data, and current wage information. In most circumstances, we will request additional documentation from all affected individuals, such as when an individual does not have a tax return on file and attests to an income significantly below current wage data.</p></blockquote>
<p>A CMS spokesperson told us that applicants would have to submit additional documentation if the IRS had no data on the individual and current income data wasn&#8217;t available either.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2013-16271.pdf">new rules</a> (see pages 346-347) state that the &#8220;temporarily expanded discretion&#8221; for 2014 that&#8217;s being given to the exchanges will pertain when an applicants&#8217; &#8220;attested annual household income is more than 10 percent below&#8221; what is shown by government data, and data on modified adjusted gross income is unavailable, and the explanation from an applicant is &#8220;insufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rules used to require that the exchanges then seek further verification for all of the suspect applications. Now, the exchanges only have to check &#8220;a statistically significant sample of the population that would otherwise be subject to such procedures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The language of the rules can be a bit cumbersome, but they match Tavenner&#8217;s explanation, which skips the legislative-ese.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Tavenner, July 9:</strong> We will request additional documentation from a random sampling of individuals only in the specific circumstance when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current income information is not available;</li>
<li>There is a significant discrepancy between the income reported on an available tax return and the income provided by the individual; and</li>
<li>The individual cannot provide an acceptable explanation for this discrepancy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We asked Blunt&#8217;s office how he could claim that the income verification requirement had been &#8220;waived&#8221; and that there was &#8220;no way to verify&#8221; what people listed as their income. Spokeswoman Amber Marchand said that checking only a sample of suspect applications gives people the opportunity to potentially get away with lying about their income. Marchand wrote in an email: &#8220;Senator Blunt was providing a simple illustration regarding how this massive law could open the door to greater fraud and abuse. As you noted, the new rules mean that the exchanges will now only verify a ‘statistically significant sample’ of those who report more than 10 percent less income than they did before. That’s not everyone. For those who report less than 10 percent, there’s absolutely no check.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that if folks want to take the gamble with their fraudulent applications, there&#8217;s less of a chance of getting caught &#8212; at least right away. But that&#8217;s not what Blunt said. Instead, he unequivocally stated that &#8220;you say what you think your income&#8217;s going to be with no way to verify that.&#8221; That&#8217;s simply not true. Applications first will be checked against available income data. And applicants committing fraud can be subject to stiff penalties.</p>
<p>The senator went on to claim, &#8220;There&#8217;s no IRS check,&#8221; which is also wrong. The IRS will check what these applications say with 2014 tax returns filed later.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>CMS final rule, July 2013: </strong>We note that we believe this exercise of enforcement discretion concerning the Exchange’s obligations to verify income information in these specific circumstances is made in the context of all information – including the actual household income amounts for 2014 – being available at the end of the year for the reconciliation performed under section 36B(f) of the Code.</p></blockquote>
<p>Section <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/36B">36B(f) of the IRS Code</a> spells out the reconciliation procedure of advance tax credits. It says that &#8220;[i]f the advance payments to a taxpayer &#8230; exceed the credit allowed &#8230; the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year shall be increased by the amount of such excess.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are limits, however, on how much the IRS can recoup if the individual or family earned more than estimated but still made under 400 percent of the federal poverty level (the threshold for receiving insurance tax credits). That same section of the IRS code goes on to say that an individual earning between 300 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level could be liable for up to $1,250 in advance tax credit over-payments, with $2,500 as the limit for families in 2014.</p>
<p>Blunt also said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know if there are any penalties if you verify wrong.&#8221; Indeed, there are penalties. Tavenner wrote that violators face &#8220;existing penalties for perjury.&#8221; Plus, &#8220;the health care law applies penalties when an individual provides false or fraudulent information,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irs.gov/irm/part9/irm_09-001-003.html">IRS perjury penalties</a> include monetary fines and/or imprisonment. The Affordable Care Act calls for &#8220;a civil penalty of not more than $25,000&#8243; for providing false or fraudulent information due to &#8220;negligence or disregard of any rules or regulations&#8221; of the secretary of Health and Human Services. The law goes further for &#8220;any person who knowingly and willfully provides false or fraudulent information.&#8221; That civil penalty can be as high as $250,000. (See page 286 <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/law/title/i-quality-affordable-health-care.pdf">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Timothy S. Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law, who writes a blog about the health care law for the journal <em><a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2013/07/07/implementing-health-reform-final-rule-on-premium-tax-credit-medicaid-and-chip-eligibility-determinations-part-1/#more-32799">Health Affairs</a></em>, told us: &#8220;It is true that they have for the first year somewhat reduced the verification requirements, but it’s in a context of a pretty thorough system of verification and a pretty serious system of penalties.&#8221;</p>

That was in fact the effect of a decision announced recently by the Treasury.</p>
<p>The Treasury <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Continuing-to-Implement-the-ACA-in-a-Careful-Thoughtful-Manner-.aspx">announced</a> on July 2 that it was delaying for a year, until 2015, the Affordable Care Act requirement that large employers provide health coverage or face penalties.</p>
<p>In her <a href="http://www.c-span.org/flvPop.aspx?id=10737440412">weekly press conference</a> on July 11, House Democratic Leader Pelosi was asked about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/us/politics/house-gop-pushes-delay-on-individual-mandate-in-health-law.html?_r=0">Republican calls</a> to also delay the so-called individual mandate that will require people to buy insurance or face a tax penalty next year.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Pelosi, July 11</strong>: In fact, the point is, is that the mandate was not delayed. Certain reporting by businesses that could be perceived as onerous, that reporting requirement was delayed, and partially to review how it would work and how it could be better. It was not a delay of the mandate for the businesses, and there shouldn&#8217;t be a delay of the mandate for individuals. (Starts at the 9:06 mark.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to complaints from the business community about the complexity of reporting requirements under the Affordable Care Act, and the need for more time to implement them, the Treasury released a blog post on July 2 announcing the one-year reprieve.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mark J. Mazur, Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, July 2</strong>: The Administration is announcing that it will provide an additional year before the ACA mandatory employer and insurer reporting requirements begin.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result of the one-year delay in reporting requirements, the Treasury announced that it would also suspend the tax penalties for large businesses that fail to provide insurance to their employees &#8212; essentially the hammer behind the &#8220;mandate.&#8221; The law requires businesses with more than 50 employees to provide health coverage to all of their full-time workers (those working at least 30 hours per week) or face a tax penalty of $2,000 per employee.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mazur:</strong> We recognize that this transition relief will make it impractical to determine which employers owe shared responsibility payments (under section 4980H) for 2014. Accordingly, we are extending this transition relief to the employer shared responsibility payments. These payments will not apply for 2014. Any employer shared responsibility payments will not apply until 2015.</p>
<p>During this 2014 transition period, we strongly encourage employers to maintain or expand health coverage. Also, our actions today do not affect employees’ access to the premium tax credits available under the ACA (nor any other provision of the ACA).</p></blockquote>
<p>Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill noted that although &#8220;the employer responsibility requirement&#8221; has been pushed back to 2015, &#8220;employers will be encouraged to maintain or expand coverage during the 2014 transition period.&#8221; That&#8217;s true, but &#8220;strongly encourage&#8221; is not the same thing as &#8220;mandating&#8221; under the threat of a tax penalty.</p>
<p>Hammill also noted that the change &#8220;does not affect employees’ access to the premium tax credits available under the ACA or any other provision of the law.&#8221; And last, he noted that the vast majority of companies with more than 50 employees already offer appropriate health insurance, and would not be affected.</p>
<p>Former White House adviser Ezekiel J. Emanuel, who helped to design the law, wrote an <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/obamas-insurance-delay-wont-affect-many/">opinion piece for the <em>New York Times</em></a> making the same point: that the change would affect only a small percentage of large employers, and therefore it would not make a big overall difference in &#8220;the progress of reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the reporting requirements affect only businesses with more than 50 employees, Emanuel said it &#8220;turned out to be a nightmare&#8221; for some businesses to determine who should be counted as a full-time employee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hours of service include paid vacation and sick time, as well as things like jury duty,&#8221; Emanuel said. &#8220;And how do seasonal workers fit in, or people who work just one semester at an academic institution?&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result of the delay in reporting requirements, Emanuel, an oncologist and vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania, noted: &#8220;Larger employers will now have until 2015 before they will have to provide insurance or face penalties.&#8221;</p>
<p>In press conferences, White House spokesman Jay Carney has <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/08/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-07082013">repeatedly</a> <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/09/daily-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-07092013">referred</a> to a delay in the &#8220;employer responsibility provision.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Pelosi and the administration are simply parsing their words, said Paul Fronstin, director of the health research program at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Pelosi is correct that the change involved postponing reporting requirements, but if employers aren&#8217;t required to provide that information, there can be no enforcement through penalties. Tax penalties are the &#8220;mandate.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Pelosi may say it is not a delay of the employer mandate, only a delay in the reporting requirement, but &#8220;in practice, it boils down to the same thing,” Fronstin said. “The bottom line is the same.”</p>

<p>She further assumes the government is going to be intimately involved in her family&#8217;s health decisions in asking, &#8220;Can I really trust the folks in Washington with my family’s health care?&#8221; Unless Julie&#8217;s family becomes eligible for Medicaid under the law, she&#8217;ll be getting private insurance, just as she is now (as best we can infer from the ad).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMAuo4C8kk">TV spot</a>, which <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/americans-for-prosperity-2/">Americans for Prosperity</a> began airing in Ohio and Virginia July 9, directs viewers to the website ObamacareRiskFactors.com, which is more misleading than the ad itself. The site warns of reduced wages and hours for those who work for small employers that aren&#8217;t even subject to the law, for instance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Ad Wars Resume</strong></span></p>
<p>Over the past four years, the Affordable Care Act has been the focus of a hefty share of ad dollars. But those for and against aren&#8217;t done arguing about it yet &#8212; in fact, the war is heating up as major provisions of the law are about to take effect. In October, the health insurance exchanges will start accepting customers, and in 2014, the individual mandate, requiring most Americans to have insurance or pay a fine, kicks in.</p>
<p>So while Julie, a mother of two, prods viewers to feed their doubts about the law, another mom praises the benefits of the legislation in a <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/health-care">TV ad from Organizing for Action</a>, a nonprofit group that advocates for the president&#8217;s policies. In that spot, airing on cable channels CNN, MSNBC, Bravo and Lifetime, Stacey Lihn says the law eliminated lifetime caps on coverage. True, <a href="http://kff.org/interactive/implementation-timeline/">lifetime limits were prohibited</a> early on, in 2010, and annual limits completely phase out on Jan. 1, 2014. Lihn, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention and has documented her family&#8217;s story on her <a href="http://thelihns.blogspot.com/">personal blog</a>, says that her daughter, Zoe, who was born with a congenital heart defect, &#8220;was halfway to her cap before her first birthday. Thanks to Obamacare, we can now afford the care that Zoe needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conservative ad is more general, and we don&#8217;t know much about the circumstances of the family in it. The mother, Julie, says her son had seizures two years ago and she has questions about Obamacare. Julie asks, &#8220;If we can&#8217;t pick our own doctor, how do I know my family&#8217;s going to get the care they need?&#8221;</p>
<iframe style="width: 500px; height:300px;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="http://video.factcheck.org/play/3fb0b092fb3"></iframe>
<p>But Julie doesn&#8217;t mean that she won&#8217;t be able to actually select a physician on her own, as the question implies. Instead, the worry is that she won&#8217;t be able to keep her current doctor.</p>
<p>AFP spokesman Levi Russell told us that the law will limit provider networks and the choice of doctors for &#8220;millions&#8221; of Americans. But the support for that claim mainly pertains to those who would be buying their own insurance on new insurance exchanges or new Medicaid enrollees who will qualify for the program under the law&#8217;s Medicaid expansion. And most of those individuals will be newly insured.</p>
<p>We can infer from the ad that Julie&#8217;s family has insurance and wouldn&#8217;t be seeking it on the exchanges or Medicaid. But we don&#8217;t know for sure. Russell would not provide more information on Julie&#8217;s circumstances other than to say she and her family are real, not actors. He said the group didn&#8217;t want to make Julie&#8217;s family the &#8220;centerpiece&#8221; of the ad campaign. &#8220;Instead, their experience should point others to go learn more for themselves and how they personally will be impacted,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume Julie&#8217;s family has employer-sponsored insurance, as 57 percent of non-elderly Americans do. AFP points out that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43900_ACAInsuranceCoverageEffects.pdf">has estimated</a> that those with work-based coverage will decline by 7 million, on net, because of the law by 2023.</p>
<p>That figure is a combination of workers losing coverage, others gaining it and others buying insurance elsewhere. The CBO estimated that for 2019 &#8212; when the net figure is 8 million &#8212; those losing an offer of employer-based insurance, which they would have received had the law not been enacted, would be 12 million, with 7 million others gaining work-based coverage because of the law, and 3 million more declining their employers&#8217; offer and getting insurance elsewhere. CBO <a href="http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10868/12-19-reid_letter_managers_correction_noted.pdf">has explained</a> in its previous estimates that businesses dropping coverage are likely to be smaller companies with low-income workers who would be able to get subsidies to buy insurance on the exchanges.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible Julie will find herself among the employees who lose coverage, buy a new plan elsewhere and not have her same doctor in the provider network. But her chances are small: 160 million Americans are expected to have work-based coverage in 2023 under the law, up from 155 million in 2013.</p>
<p>AFP provided two other pieces of support for this claim. A March 1, 2013, <em>Wall Street Journal </em><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323699704578328693720458354.html?mod=itp">article</a> said that some insurance plans sold on exchanges will likely have small networks of providers in order to keep premium costs down: The insurers were asking for a discount from hospital groups in exchange for the hospitals getting new customers as part of a small network. And a <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/31/8/1673.abstract"><em>Health Affairs</em> study</a> found 31 percent of doctors didn&#8217;t accept new Medicaid patients in 2011. That&#8217;s not due to the health care law, but it&#8217;s a concern since the law will expand Medicaid eligibility by about 12 million in the coming decade. That study also said an increase in fees to primary care physicians under the law &#8212; for 2013 and 2014 &#8212; could boost the acceptance rate, at least temporarily. But doctors not being open to new patients is a problem generally: Eighteen percent weren&#8217;t accepting new privately insured patients.</p>
<p>Perhaps more germane to this losing-your-doctor worry is the fact that the Affordable Care Act doesn&#8217;t guarantee &#8212; and simply can&#8217;t &#8212; that everyone who likes their doctor and their current health plan can keep them, as President Obama has often claimed. As <a href="http://factcheck.org/2012/06/romney-obama-uphold-health-care-falsehoods/">we&#8217;ve said before</a>, employers are free to switch or drop insurance plans under the law &#8212; just as they were before it was enacted. And workers who change jobs have no guarantee &#8212; before or after the law &#8212; that their new health plan will include their doctors in provider networks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Premiums, Pay Checks and Big Government</span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Julie goes on to ask, &#8220;What am I getting in exchange for higher premiums and a smaller paycheck?&#8221; Again, we don&#8217;t know Julie&#8217;s circumstances and why she assumes her paycheck is going to get smaller and her premiums are going up. But it&#8217;s true that expanded benefits required by the law have caused premiums for work-based plans to go up, on average.</p>
<p>When family premiums for employer plans jumped 9 percent from 2010 to 2011, <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/factchecking-health-insurance-premiums/">experts told us</a> the Affordable Care Act was responsible for a 1 percent to 3 percent hike, with the remainder due to higher medical costs, the usual culprit for increasing premiums. The law&#8217;s provisions that caused the bump were the elimination of preexisting condition exclusions for children, the requirement that dependents be covered on their parents&#8217; plan to age 26, free coverage of preventive care, and the increase in caps on annual coverage.</p>
<p>So those are some of the increased benefits that Julie is already getting in exchange for slightly higher premiums.</p>
<p>For 2012, employer-based insurance went up a <a href="http://kff.org/health-costs/perspective/pulling-it-together-reflections-on-this-years/">much smaller</a> <a href="http://kff.org/private-insurance/press-release/family-health-premiums-rise-4-percent-to/">4 percent on average</a>. The <a href="http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/Proj2011PDF.pdf">growth in national health spending</a> from 2009 to 2011 has been at historic lows, around 4 percent, and that trend is expected to continue for 2012 and 2013. Experts mainly say the down economy is the reason for reduced growth in spending, though <a href="http://factcheck.org/2013/02/factchecking-obamas-sotu/">it&#8217;s possible</a> the Affordable Care Act&#8217;s emphasis on new payment models may be leading to more efficient care by health care providers.</p>
<p>If Julie purchases her own insurance, it&#8217;s unknown what exactly would happen to her premium, as <a href="http://factcheck.org/2013/03/obamacare-to-cost-20000-a-family/">we&#8217;ve explained before</a>. Some individuals will pay more, and some will pay less. Some will get significantly more generous benefits for higher premiums; others may not even want a more generous plan. Benefits and premiums vary widely on that market, and the change in premiums for individuals will likely also vary widely &#8212; depending on what benefits they have now, health status, the protections of the state they live in and more. The Affordable Care Act does prevent discrimination based on preexisting conditions, limit variation in premium rates (to age, where you live, family size and tobacco use), and require a minimum benefit standard for these plans.</p>
<p>Most of those purchasing plans on the exchanges &#8212; about 80 percent &#8212; will qualify for government subsidies to offset the premium cost, <a href="http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43900_ACAInsuranceCoverageEffects.pdf">according to the Congressional Budget Office</a>. If Julie&#8217;s family earns up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level &#8212; $94,200 for a family of four &#8212; the family will qualify for a subsidy.</p>
<p>Finally, Julie wonders how well the government can manage her health care, asking, &#8220;Can I really trust the folks in Washington with my family’s health care?&#8221; But the law doesn&#8217;t put the government in charge of health care decisions &#8212; despite the <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2010/10/health-care-spin-again/">many claims</a> <a href="http://factcheck.org/2010/10/patakis-bogus-health-care-claims/">we&#8217;ve seen</a> <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2010/12/let-the-distortions-begin/">over the years</a> <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2013/03/bachmanns-killer-health-care-claims/">to the contrary</a>. This isn&#8217;t a <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2009/11/the-government-run-mantra/">&#8220;government-run&#8221;</a> plan or &#8220;takeover,&#8221; as so many have tried to claim. There&#8217;s no board <a href="http://factcheck.org/2012/01/neurological-death-panels/">deciding who gets brain surgery</a> or picking anybody&#8217;s doctor for them.</p>
<p>The law greatly expands private insurance, bringing millions of new customers to insurance companies. It&#8217;s true there are new insurance regulations as we&#8217;ve mentioned &#8212; no annual or lifetime limits on coverage, no preexisting condition exclusions, a standard set of minimum benefit requirements for plans on the exchanges. But those are consumer protections, not rules that put Washington in charge of managing families&#8217; health care.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>More Questions than Answers</strong></span></p>
<p>The AFP ad encourages viewers to visit ObamacareRiskFactors.com, where they can input some basic information about themselves and answer the question, &#8220;Are you at risk under the new healthcare law?&#8221; But don&#8217;t expect an unbiased answer.</p>
<p>When we said we worked for an employer with 0 to 50 employees, our first <a href="http://www.obamacareriskfactors.com/index.php/results/536">risk factor</a> was a warning that our hours or pay could be cut because of &#8220;requirements to provide insurance to all employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>The warning said that &#8220;government forces employers to make a difficult choice: reduce employee’s hours or wages or go out of business.&#8221; But employers with less than 50 full-time workers aren&#8217;t subject to any requirement to provide insurance to their employees. There was no mention of that, despite the fact that we had said we worked for a small employer. (The administration recently <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Continuing-to-Implement-the-ACA-in-a-Careful-Thoughtful-Manner-.aspx">announced</a> that it was delaying the requirement for employers with 50 or more workers for one year, until 2015.)</p>
<p>The risk factors we received also warned of &#8220;longer lines and delayed care,&#8221; citing a doctor shortage of 45,000 primary care physicians by 2020, estimated by the Association of American Medical Colleges. The warning doesn&#8217;t make clear that the AAMC said a shortage was predicted before the law was passed, but the shortage coupled with adding tens of millions to the rolls of the insured is certainly a legitimate concern. AAMC <a href="https://www.aamc.org/download/286592/data/">said</a> the coverage expansion will &#8220;exacerbate a physician shortage driven by the rapid expansion of the number of Americans over age 65.&#8221; It called for Medicare-funded residency training to help alleviate the problem.</p>
<p>AFP exaggerates by saying that &#8220;[t]hese problems will continue to get worse as one-third of doctors will retire over the next decade &#8212; many fueled by ObamaCare’s rules and regulations.&#8221; AAMC says simply that one-third will retire because &#8220;[o]ur doctors are getting older, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Americans for Prosperity almost gets it right when it says that &#8220;ObamaCare mandates that employers provide insurance coverage to all full-time employees, but it doesn’t mandate that coverage be provided for spouses or children.&#8221; The law does mandate that insurance policies cover children up to age 26. But it&#8217;s true there&#8217;s no mandate for coverage of spouses.</p>
<p>Of course, there was no mandate for employers to cover spouses before the law, and some firms have charged more for spouses or, for a small percentage of large firms, excluded them from coverage. The human resources consulting firm Mercer <a href="http://www.mercer.com/press-releases/1491670">has said</a> that its 2012 health benefits survey found 4 percent of employers with 5,000 or more employees denied coverage for spouses. MarketWatch reported in a <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-your-boss-is-dumping-your-wife-2013-02-22">February 2013 article</a> that the practice, primarily used for spouses who could get insurance through their own jobs, could increase as health care expenses continue to rise (with or without the Affordable Care Act) and as the state-based exchanges created under the law give spouses another option for coverage. MarketWatch quoted Joan Smyth, a benefits consultant at Mercer as saying, “When there’s a place for people to go, employers won’t feel as beholden or compelled to cover the spouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the lack of a spouse mandate will have an impact.</p>
<p>The risk factors also warned that &#8220;[f]ailing to purchase insurance will result in a tax penalty of $695.&#8221; <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2012/06/how-much-is-the-obamacare-tax/">True, when the law is fully implemented in 2016</a>. But the AFP site only tells half the story. It doesn&#8217;t ask whether individuals already have insurance or not, and it says nothing about opportunities for federal subsidies to help the uninsured buy coverage or expansion of Medicaid eligibility.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not suggesting that the Affordable Care Act shouldn&#8217;t prompt questions and concern from Americans. There are many unknowns about how exactly a law of this magnitude will play out, particularly its impact on those who buy their own insurance. But don&#8217;t expect honest answers from a partisan anti-Obamacare campaign.</p>

<ul>
<li>Labrador claimed the so-called &#8220;Gang of Eight&#8221; bill would give legal status to 11 million people currently living in the U.S. illegally. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the number to be about 8 million.</li>
<li>He also claimed Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano &#8220;has already said that the border is secure,&#8221; and predicted she will tell Congress &#8220;nothing else needs to happen.&#8221; Napolitano repeatedly has said that the border &#8220;is as secure as it&#8217;s ever been,&#8221; but more needs to be done.</li>
<li>Labrador also said the bill would provide &#8220;20,000 non-ag[ricultural] guest workers per year for the entire United States.&#8221; That&#8217;s true for the first year, but it quickly ramps up to 75,000 by the fourth year.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>&#8216;Legalization of 11 million People&#8217;?</strong></span></p>
<p>Labrador, an <a href="http://wpress.bootnetworks.com/wp-admin/labrador.house.gov">Idaho Republican</a>, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/52399650/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/t/july-bob-menendez-raul-labrador-robin-wright-tom-friedman-jeff-goldberg-chuck-todd-andrea-mitchell-ej-dionne-david-brooks-gene-robinson/#.UdrGB5yaZ_M">repeatedly exaggerated</a> the number of people living in the U.S. illegally who would gain legal status under the Senate bill. Twice, he said the figure was 11 million, including in the sentence below.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Labrador, July 7</strong>: &#8230; my concern with the Senate bill is that they put the legalization of 11 million people ahead of security. The legalization happens first, and then the security happens second.</p></blockquote>
<p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/s744.pdf">says in a June 2013 report</a> that there were &#8220;about 11.5 million unauthorized residents living in the United States at the end of 2011.&#8221; But not all of them would become legal under the <a href="http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=285276e0-9fe6-4914-a3b2-cac1e0c2c505">Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.</a> The CBO says &#8220;approximately 8 million of the unauthorized residents already in the country would obtain legal status&#8221; under the bill.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the Senate bill requires those living in the U.S. illegally to meet certain criteria before they can gain legal status. <a href="http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/faqs">A Q-and-A page on the website of Republican Sen. Marco Rubio</a>, a cosponsor of the bill, says those persons must “be fingerprinted, undergo criminal background checks, [and] pay fines and [back] taxes before any temporary status can be attained.”</p>
<p>CBO estimates that the vast majority of the 8 million would gain legal status as &#8220;Registered Provisional Immigrants,&#8221; or RPIs. And that&#8217;s just the first step toward permanent residency, <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/human-services/short-overview-of-2013-senate-immigration-bill.aspx">as explained</a> by the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>NCSL, April 26</strong>: Initial registration would be valid for six years then RPIs must apply for renewal, which requires a background check, additional fees and a fine along with proof of employment and proof that they will not become a public charge. After 10 years, RPIs can apply for an adjustment in status, like Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR), and, after three additional years, apply for naturalization. Fees and fines will need to be paid as well as demonstrated proof of employment, English language acquisition, and passing a background check, among other requirements.</p></blockquote>
<p>Labrador isn&#8217;t the only opponent of the Senate immigration bill to make such an exaggeration. In a June 25 floor speech (<a href="http://beta.congress.gov/crec/2013/06/25/CREC-2013-06-25.pdf">page S5140</a>), Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said the Senate bill &#8220;takes some 11 million people who are here illegally and it grants them what is called RPI status &#8212; registered provisional immigrant status.&#8221; That&#8217;s simply not so.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Border Security</strong></span></p>
<p>Labrador repeated the 11 million figure when he questioned Napolitano&#8217;s commitment to border security. He said that he doesn&#8217;t trust the Obama administration to appropriately secure the border, and that benchmarks must be part of a comprehensive immigration bill before legalization of immigrants is allowed to move forward.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Labrador, July 7</strong>: If you give to this administration the authority to decide when they’re going to enforce the law, how they’re going to enforce the law, and you tell them that it’s okay if they decide if there’s going to be 20,000 &#8230; border patrol agents or they get to determine when the border is secure, I can tell you that Janet Napolitano has already said that the border is secure. So what’s going to happen is that we’re going to give legalization to 11 million people and Janet Napolitano is going to come to Congress and tell us that the border is already secure and nothing else needs to happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>We contacted Labrador spokesman Todd Winer and asked when Napolitano said that &#8220;the border is secure.&#8221; Winer cited four instances. In an <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/power-players-abc-news/janet-napolitano-border-less-secure-because-budget-cuts-120328755.html">ABC News/Yahoo interview on March 4</a>, Napolitano said the border &#8220;is as secure as it&#8217;s ever been [in my experience].&#8221; Winer also cited a March 25, 2011, Associated Press report in which <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047102-503544.html">Napolitano stated</a> at the Bridge of The Americas border crossing in El Paso, Texas, that &#8220;[t]here is a perception that the border is worse now than it ever has been. That is wrong. The border is better now than it ever has been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Winer also cited <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jun/21/napolitano-approves-senates-border-security-plan/#ixzz2YYwgfeOi">Senate testimony</a> from Napolitano in which she stated: “Too often the border security refrain simply serves as an excuse. Our borders have in fact never been stronger.”</p>
<p>In all three instances, Napolitano used variations of the claim that the border is more secure <em>than it has ever been</em>. That&#8217;s different than saying the border is secure.</p>
<p>Last, Winer cited an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/03/janet-napolitano-says-border-security-trigger-unworkable/">ABC News account</a> of <a href="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/event/216242">a forum</a> hosted by the <em>Christian Science Monitor </em>on March 26. At that event, Napolitano said &#8220;the border is as secure as it’s ever been,&#8221; and she argued against &#8220;relying on one thing as a so-called trigger&#8221; to allow the legalization process to begin. But she didn&#8217;t claim that the border is already secure or that &#8220;nothing else needs to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the fuller context of her remarks:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Napolitano, March 26</strong>: The numbers have been driven to 40 year lows if you just look at things like apprehensions. So we know we’re achieving success there. But a real measure is more qualitative. Really, when you step back and think about the border, what you want is the ability to spot illegal traffic, particularly in the highly trafficked areas &#8230; And then the ability to respond to what’s seen. And using that measure and the plans we have, we’re confident that the border is as secure as it’s ever been. But there’s no one number that captures that. That is the problem, if you are looking for just one number. Border security encompasses a lot of different things. But as we look at managing the border, what we’re looking for is the ability to detect illegal persons and contraband coming across the border and the ability to intercede.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later in the forum, Napolitano was asked directly about tying security triggers to legalization.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Napolitano, March 26</strong>: I think once people really look at the whole system and how it works, relying on one thing as a so-called trigger is not the way to go. There needs to be certainty in the bill so that people know when they can legalize and then when the pathway to citizenship, earned citizenship, would open up. There’s also talk about getting in the back of the line. That’s easier said than done &#8212; calculating what the line is at any given time. It moves. So those judgments will have to be made. But I think the key thing is to have border security in the bill, to open up legal migration more than it is, to deal with employers, and then to have certainty with how the 11 million here, who are either illegal or undocumented, depending on what your vocabulary is, come out of the shadows.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Napolitano argued against a single metric as a trigger for legalization of immigrants, but she also stated that &#8220;the key thing is to have border security in the bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>She has consistently stressed, as she did in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvWBOAYey8k">remarks at the Washington Conference on the Americas on May 8</a>, that more needs to be done.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Napolitano, May 8:</strong> One of the problems historically has been that once the attention is turned to something else, the resources go away. Those resources need to be sustained. This is a big border. It&#8217;s a heavily trafficked border. And we know we can do even more to secure it. So let no one think there&#8217;s not a commitment to doing that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, although not mentioned by Labrador&#8217;s office, we did find one instance of Napolitano saying “I believe the border is secure.&#8221; It came during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aLopSx7NB8">news conference</a> in San Diego on Feb. 5, after she toured the border. She was asked directly by a reporter, &#8220;You believe the border is secure then, today?&#8221; (It starts at about the 8 minute mark.)</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Napolitano, Feb. 5</strong>: I believe the border is secure. I believe the border is a safe border. That’s not to say that everything is 100 percent. It would be unrealistic, and no one I think using common sense would say you eliminate all crime, all illegal immigration. There is no city in the United States that has no crime, and yet most people believe they live in a fairly safe city or safe city. So, you have to look at a number of different things. Our commitment is to continue to invest, as we have been, to do it in a planned way, to do it in a way that emphasizes efforts at the border, emphasizes efforts in the interior of the country on more effective enforcement in the interior, more effective operation against employers who create the demand for a lot of illegal immigration, and we’re going to continue that. But I got to tell you … we can only do so much without having an overhaul of the immigration system writ large.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though she once said &#8220;the border is secure,&#8221; Napolitano has repeatedly used variations of the claim that the border is &#8220;as secure as it&#8217;s ever been.&#8221; That&#8217;s different.</p>
<p>Labrador raises a legitimate issue about whether there ought to be security benchmarks that must be met before legalization of immigrants begins. Napolitano has cautioned against using &#8220;one thing as a so-called trigger.&#8221; But Labrador&#8217;s claim that Napolitano would argue &#8220;nothing else needs to happen&#8221; contradicts her repeated public statements that more border security ought to be part of an immigration bill.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Guest Workers</strong></span></p>
<p>Labrador also told only part of the story when he cited the number of nonagricultural guest visas in the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113s744es/pdf/BILLS-113s744es.pdf">Senate bill</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Labrador, July 7:</strong> One of the problems with the Senate bill that we haven&#8217;t talked about is that the non-ag [sic] guest worker portion of the Senate bill &#8230; starts out at 20,000 guest workers per year. Think about that. I&#8217;ve had some congressmen say, &#8216;Do you mean 20,000 per county? 20,000 per state?&#8217; And it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s 20,000 non-ag [sic] guest workers per year for the entire United States. You&#8217;re not going to cut back illegal immigration by only bringing 20,000 guest workers to the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>Labrador is talking about the new W-Visa program in the bill, which would allow a set number of guest-worker visas to foreign workers in lesser-skilled, nonagricultural occupations such as hospitality, janitorial, retail and construction.</p>
<p>Labrador is correct that the number of W-Visas issued in the first year under the Senate bill would be 20,000. But the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:SN00744:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp;">number quickly ramps up to</a> 75,000 by the fourth year, and could go as high as 200,000 in subsequent years.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>S. 744 Bill Summary:</strong> Limits the number of registered positions that may be approved each year to: (1) 20,000 for the first year (to begin on April 1, 2015, and end on March 31, 2016, unless the Secretary determines that the first year shall begin on October 1, 2015, and end on September 30, 2016); (2) 35,000 for the second year; (3) 55,000 for the third year; and (4) 75,000 for the fourth year.</p></blockquote>
<p>The number of W-Visas issued in subsequent years would be determined by a formula that takes into account such factors as unemployment rates and occupational shortcomings. After the fourth year, the number could be as high as 200,000 and as low as 20,000 in any given year.</p>
<p>The caps came about as a result of negotiations with union and business leaders. Labrador&#8217;s concern about the low number of W-Visas is <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100652415">shared</a> by a number of people in the business community. Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania unsuccessfully proposed an amendment that would have taken the cap on the number of W-Visas up to 200,000 in the first year; and up to 350,000 by the fourth year. (See <a href="http://beta.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/06/20/senate-section/article/S4730-2">page 4738</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do not raise the caps for the low-skilled workers who want to come to this country, then the next wave of illegal immigration is guaranteed regardless of what we do at the border,&#8221; Toomey said when he introduced the amendment.</p>
<p>We take no position on the appropriate number of W-Visas. But when Labrador says the number starts at 20,000, he doesn&#8217;t give the full picture.</p>

<p>That claim &#8212; appearing on the conservative GOPUSA site &#8212; is far from true.</p>
<p>The number of adults &#8220;actually working&#8221; was just under 136 million in April, according to the most recent figures from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/data/#employment">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. And the number of adults &#8212; and children &#8212; getting any form of federal food assistance was put at 101 million by <a href="http://www.usda.gov/oig/webdocs/27001-0001-10.pdf">a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Inspector General</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, the GOPUSA headline is off by 35 million people. It&#8217;s also a false apples-to-fruit-salad comparison and a fallacious dichotomy as well, as we&#8217;ll show in a moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Savings Issue Ignored</strong></span></p>
<p>To be sure, the expansion of food-aid programs and their costs raises a legitimate issue, especially in times of historically massive budget deficits. That 101 million figure is a large one &#8212; just under one in three <a href="http://www.census.gov/popclock/">U.S. residents</a>. Furthermore, the Inspector General&#8217;s report, <a href="http://www.usda.gov/oig/index.htm">released July 3</a>, concluded that the federal government &#8220;could potentially achieve cost savings&#8221; by eliminating duplication and overlap in its 15 nutrition assistance programs, which the IG said were budgeted at $114 billion in fiscal year 2012.</p>
<p>But the federal <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/">Food and Nutrition Service</a> balked, saying a study of the issue would &#8220;divert limited resources away from other pressing issues of greater policy relevance.&#8221; It agreed only to come up by Sept. 30 with an estimate of what such a study would cost, and how to go about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Twisting Facts into Falsehood</strong></span></p>
<p>But rather than admonish the Obama administration for resisting an opportunity to reduce deficits by streamlining possibly duplicative food-aid programs, some partisan sites are making false comparisons between workers and food-aid beneficiaries.</p>
<p>For example, the GOPUSA item is actually a <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/101m-get-food-aid-federal-gov-t-outnumber-full-time-private-sector-workers">recycling of an earlier item</a> posted by CNSNews.com, another conservative site. The headline: &#8220;101M Get Food Aid from Federal Gov’t; Outnumber Full-Time Private Sector Workers&#8221;</p>
<p>The CNS item is a bit closer to being accurate, but misleads and exaggerates in multiple ways.</p>
<p>First, note that it compares those receiving federal food aid with &#8220;full-time, private sector&#8221; workers &#8212; leaving out millions of full-time government workers and millions more who are working part time, usually by choice. Second, as the story makes clear, the number of workers is an average for all of 2012, and thus is months out of date.</p>
<p>Unlike the GOPUSA item, the CNS story is literally true &#8212; as far as it goes. According to <a href="http://origin.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2013/07/BLS-2012-Full-Time-vs-Part-Time.pdf">figures that BLS supplies on request</a>, but doesn&#8217;t routinely publish on its website, the so-called <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/">household survey</a> found that an average of 142,469,000 were employed during calendar year 2012.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>A FactCheck.org technical note:</strong> The BLS household survey produces larger total employment figures than the more authoritative and much larger <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ces/">payroll survey</a> we cited earlier, and which nearly all economists use as the standard gauge for total employment. One reason for the discrepancy is that the household survey counts self-employed persons. But the payroll survey does not break down jobs by full or part time, so we will rely for the remainder of our critique on the same household survey figures cited by CNS and GOPUSA.</p></blockquote>
<p>That 142 million figure for total employment is far more than the estimated 101 million who receive any form of federal food aid, of course. But the CNS story first subtracts all of the 27,661,000 who worked part time (mostly by choice), and then subtracted 17,629,000 full-time government workers (mostly state and local workers including teachers, police, firefighters and such). That got its comparison number down to 97,180,000 &#8220;full time, private sector&#8221; workers.</p>
<p>That was accurate for 2012, but the<a href="http://origin.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2013/07/BLS-June-2013-Full-Time-vs-Part-Time.pdf"> most recent household survey figures for June 2013</a> provide a less dramatic contrast. They show that 144,841,000 people were employed, full time or part time. Subtracting 27,442,000 part-time workers and 17,152,000 full-time government workers gets the number down to 100,247,000 &#8212; not too far below the estimated 101 million receiving some form of federal food aid.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Apples to Fruit Salad</span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>The comparison is deceptive not only because it omits millions of productively employed government and part-time workers, but also because it compares adult workers to the total food-aid population, which is largely made up of children (and some who are elderly). That&#8217;s not quite comparing apples to oranges, but it is like comparing apples to a fruit salad.</p>
<p>Children made up 45 percent of people receiving food stamps, according to <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/ora/menu/Published/snap/FILES/Participation/2011CharacteristicsSummary.pdf">the most recent annual report</a> issued by the USDA in November 2012. An additional 9 percent were over age 60. The program is now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP and is the largest of the food-aid programs.</p>
<p>And of course, the<a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/36slmonthly.htm"> national school lunch program</a>, which serves nearly 31 million, goes by definition to schoolchildren. The same goes for the smaller <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/35sbmonthly.htm">school breakfast program</a>, which serves more than 13 million children.</p>
<p>These food-aid programs overlap (which was the point of the IG report), so we can&#8217;t say for certain how many of the estimated 101 million on one or more food-aid programs are children, or who are beyond normal working age. The IG&#8217;s report doesn&#8217;t provide that detail. But it&#8217;s clear the number is a large one, and the comparison of children and elderly to working-age adults is inappropriate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>False Dilemma</strong></span></p>
<p>The comparison also sets up a common logical fallacy &#8212; the <a href="http://www.philosophy-index.com/logic/fallacies/false-dilemma.php">false dilemma</a> or false dichotomy. The fact is, millions of those who receive food aid are also working at low-wage jobs. The two categories are not, as the comparison suggests, mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>The IG report doesn&#8217;t specify how many food-aid recipients are employed. However, <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/ora/menu/Published/snap/FILES/Participation/2011CharacteristicsSummary.pdf">the  USDA&#8217;s annual report</a> states that over 30 percent of all households receiving SNAP benefits (food stamps) had some earnings in 2011. Furthermore, 41 percent of the people getting those benefits lived in a household with some earnings.</p>
<p>Either way, the idea that people either work or get food aid is a false one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Careless Error</span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>The GOPUSA headline that first caught our eye further twisted the facts beyond the breaking point, and was simply and grossly false as we noted at the outset.</p>
<p>The story itself is also false, actually misquoting the original CNS story. It says more people are now getting food aid &#8220;than are working in the private sector,&#8221; which is not correct. The author who cribbed this partisan claim from CNS carelessly failed to specify &#8220;full time&#8221; workers.</p>
<p>In fact, according to the June figures from the BLS household survey, more than 125 million people were working in nongovernment jobs in June, either full or part time. So both the story and its headline get it wrong. Both the original CNS story and the carelessly lifted GOPUSA story amount to food-aid foolery designed more to inflame partisan biases than to inform.</p>
